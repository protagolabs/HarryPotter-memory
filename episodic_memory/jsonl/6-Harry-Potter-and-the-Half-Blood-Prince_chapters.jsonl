{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter1": "THE OTHER MINISTER\n\n\n\n\nIt was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every one of them was the government\u2019s fault.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be spending a lot more time with his family?\n\n\u201cA grim mood has gripped the country,\u201d the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin.\n\nAnd unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual. Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of July. . . . It wasn\u2019t right, it wasn\u2019t normal. . . .\n\nHe turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a handsome room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he heard a soft cough behind him.\n\nHe froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He turned very slowly to face the empty room.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.\n\nFor a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It was coming \u2014 as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough \u2014 from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room.\n\n\u201cTo the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.\u201d\n\nThe man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said the Prime Minister, \u201clisten. . . . It\u2019s not a very good time for me. . . . I\u2019m waiting for a telephone call, you see . . . from the President of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat can be rearranged,\u201d said the portrait at once. The Prime Minister\u2019s heart sank. He had been afraid of that.\n\n\u201cBut I really was rather hoping to speak \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,\u201d said the little man. \u201cKindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . oh . . . very well,\u201d said the Prime Minister weakly. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll see Fudge.\u201d\n\nHe hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He had barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand.\n\n\u201cAh . . . Prime Minister,\u201d said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward with his hand outstretched. \u201cGood to see you again.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment, so said nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in politicians before, and it never boded well.\n\n\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d he said, shaking Fudge\u2019s hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.\n\n\u201cDifficult to know where to begin,\u201d muttered Fudge, pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his knees. \u201cWhat a week, what a week . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHad a bad one too, have you?\u201d asked the Prime Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. \u201cI\u2019ve been having the same week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge . . . the Bones and Vance murders . . . not to mention the ruckus in the West Country . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 er \u2014 your \u2014 I mean to say, some of your people were \u2014 were involved in those \u2014 those things, were they?\u201d\n\nFudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. \u201cOf course they were,\u201d he said. \u201cSurely you\u2019ve realized what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . .\u201d hesitated the Prime Minister.\n\nIt was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike Fudge\u2019s visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy. But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day.\n\nHe had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself.\n\nNaturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless throughout Fudge\u2019s kindly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical population from getting wind of them. It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.\n\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d he had said, \u201cit\u2019s odds-on you\u2019ll never see me again. I\u2019ll only bother you if there\u2019s something really serious going on our end, something that\u2019s likely to affect the Muggles \u2014 the non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, it\u2019s live and let live. And I must say, you\u2019re taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.\u201d\n\nAt this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re not a hoax, then?\u201d\n\nIt had been his last, desperate hope.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Fudge gently. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not. Look.\u201d\n\nAnd he had turned the Prime Minister\u2019s teacup into a gerbil.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech, \u201cbut why \u2014 why has nobody told me \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,\u201d said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. \u201cWe find it the best way to maintain secrecy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d bleated the Prime Minister, \u201cwhy hasn\u2019t a former Prime Minister warned me \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nAt this, Fudge had actually laughed.\n\n\u201cMy dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?\u201d\n\nStill chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?\n\nThe shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced Fudge\u2019s arrival. To the Prime Minister\u2019s dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office. Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened.\n\nThen, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic. Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of, a man named \u201cSerious\u201d Black, something that sounded like \u201cHogwarts,\u201d and a boy called Harry Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.\n\n\u201c. . . I\u2019ve just come from Azkaban,\u201d Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. \u201cMiddle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight . . . the dementors are in uproar\u201d \u2014 he shuddered \u2014 \u201cthey\u2019ve never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Black\u2019s a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who. . . . But of course, you don\u2019t even know who You-Know-Who is!\u201d He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, then said, \u201cWell, sit down, sit down, I\u2019d better fill you in. . . . Have a whiskey . . .\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister\u2019s hand, and drew up a chair.\n\nFudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister\u2019s whiskey-free hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.\n\n\u201cSo you think that . . .\u201d He had squinted down at the name in his left hand. \u201cLord Vol \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\u201d snarled Fudge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. . . . You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is still alive, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Dumbledore says he is,\u201d said Fudge, as he had fastened his pin-striped cloak under his chin, \u201cbut we\u2019ve never found him. If you ask me, he\u2019s not dangerous unless he\u2019s got support, so it\u2019s Black we ought to be worrying about. You\u2019ll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don\u2019t see each other again, Prime Minister! Good night.\u201d\n\nBut they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like) World Cup and that several Muggles had been \u201cinvolved,\u201d but that the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that You-Know-Who\u2019s Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.\n\n\u201cOh, and I almost forgot,\u201d Fudge had added. \u201cWe\u2019re importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament, quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that it\u2019s down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we\u2019re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 what \u2014 dragons?\u201d spluttered the Prime Minister.\n\n\u201cYes, three,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cAnd a sphinx. Well, good day to you.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later, Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.\n\n\u201cA mass breakout?\u201d repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.\n\n\u201cNo need to worry, no need to worry!\u201d shouted Fudge, already with one foot in the flames. \u201cWe\u2019ll have them rounded up in no time \u2014 just thought you ought to know!\u201d\n\nAnd before the Prime Minister could shout, \u201cNow, wait just one moment!\u201d Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.\n\nWhatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudge\u2019s assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. The sight, therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.\n\n\u201cHow should I know what\u2019s going on in the \u2014 er \u2014 Wizarding community?\u201d snapped the Prime Minister now. \u201cI have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the same concerns,\u201d Fudge interrupted. \u201cThe Brockdale Bridge didn\u2019t wear out. That wasn\u2019t really a hurricane. Those murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley\u2019s family would be safer without him. We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should be effected tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you . . . I\u2019m afraid I . . . What?\u201d blustered the Prime Minister.\n\nFudge took a great, deep breath and said, \u201cPrime Minister, I am very sorry to have to tell you that he\u2019s back. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack? When you say \u2018back\u2019 . . . he\u2019s alive? I mean \u2014\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that horrible conversation of three years previously, when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier.\n\n\u201cYes, alive,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cThat is \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 is a man alive if he can\u2019t be killed? I don\u2019t really understand it, and Dumbledore won\u2019t explain properly \u2014 but anyway, he\u2019s certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the purposes of our discussion, yes, he\u2019s alive.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.\n\n\u201cIs Serious Black with \u2014 er \u2014 He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack? Black?\u201d said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers. \u201cSirius Black, you mean? Merlin\u2019s beard, no. Black\u2019s dead. Turns out we were \u2014 er \u2014 mistaken about Black. He was innocent after all. And he wasn\u2019t in league with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named either. I mean,\u201d he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, \u201call the evidence pointed \u2014 we had more than fifty eyewitnesses \u2014 but anyway, as I say, he\u2019s dead. Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises. There\u2019s going to be an inquiry, actually. . . .\u201d\n\nTo his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge. . . . Not yet, anyway . . .\n\nWhile the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk, Fudge continued, \u201cBut Black\u2019s by-the-by now. The point is, we\u2019re at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt war?\u201d repeated the Prime Minister nervously. \u201cSurely that\u2019s a little bit of an overstatement?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,\u201d said Fudge, speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a lime-green blur. \u201cSince they have moved into the open, they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridge \u2014 he did it, Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGood grief, so it\u2019s your fault those people were killed and I\u2019m having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don\u2019t know what else!\u201d said the Prime Minister furiously.\n\n\u201cMy fault!\u201d said Fudge, coloring up. \u201cAre you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding about the room, \u201cbut I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really think I wasn\u2019t already making every effort?\u201d demanded Fudge heatedly. \u201cEvery Auror in the Ministry was \u2014 and is \u2014 trying to find him and round up his followers, but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I suppose you\u2019re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?\u201d said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the government\u2019s fault after all.\n\n\u201cThat was no hurricane,\u201d said Fudge miserably.\n\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. \u201cTrees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts bent, horrible injuries \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the Death Eaters,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\u2019s followers. And . . . and we suspect giant involvement.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall. \u201cWhat involvement?\u201d\n\nFudge grimaced. \u201cHe used giants last time, when he wanted to go for the grand effect,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock, we\u2019ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened, we\u2019ve got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset, but we can\u2019t find the giant \u2014 it\u2019s been a disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say!\u201d said the Prime Minister furiously.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cWhat with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cLosing who?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may have murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch and \u2014 and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight.\u201d\n\nFudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped spinning his bowler hat.\n\n\u201cBut that murder was in the newspapers,\u201d said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. \u201cOur newspapers. Amelia Bones . . . it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived alone. It was a \u2014 a nasty killing, wasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s had rather a lot of publicity. The police are baffled, you see.\u201d\n\nFudge sighed. \u201cWell, of course they are,\u201d he said. \u201cKilled in a room that was locked from the inside, wasn\u2019t she? We, on the other hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further toward catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe you didn\u2019t hear about that one \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes I did!\u201d said the Prime Minister. \u201cIt happened just around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a field day with it, \u2018breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minister\u2019s backyard \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as if all that wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Fudge, barely listening to the Prime Minister, \u201cwe\u2019ve got dementors swarming all over the place, attacking people left, right, and center. . . .\u201d\n\nOnce upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.\n\n\u201cI thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban,\u201d he said cautiously.\n\n\u201cThey did,\u201d said Fudge wearily. \u201cBut not anymore. They\u2019ve deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I won\u2019t pretend that wasn\u2019t a blow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, \u201cdidn\u2019t you tell me they\u2019re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. And they\u2019re breeding. That\u2019s what\u2019s causing all this mist.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair. The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made him feel quite faint.\n\n\u201cNow see here, Fudge \u2014 you\u2019ve got to do something! It\u2019s your responsibility as Minister of Magic!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Prime Minister, you can\u2019t honestly think I\u2019m still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I\u2019ve never known them so united in my whole term of office!\u201d said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile.\n\nThe Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still rather felt for the shrunken-looking man sitting opposite him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. I rather thought he\u2019d be here by now, but of course, he\u2019s very busy at the moment, with so much going on.\u201d\n\nFudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill. Catching Fudge\u2019s eye, the portrait said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be here in a moment, he\u2019s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish him luck,\u201d said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight, but he won\u2019t budge. If he\u2019d just been prepared to persuade the boy, I might still be . . . Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.\u201d\n\nFudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly spoke in its crisp, official voice.\n\n\u201cTo the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting. Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, fine,\u201d said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug.\n\nFudge got to his feet and, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, the Prime Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust down his long black robes, and look around.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s first, foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times.\n\n\u201cHow do you do?\u201d said the Prime Minister politely, holding out his hand.\n\nScrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then pulled out a wand from under his robes.\n\n\u201cFudge told you everything?\u201d he asked, striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard the lock click.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes,\u201d said the Prime Minister. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather that door remained unlocked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not be interrupted,\u201d said Scrimgeour shortly, \u201cor watched,\u201d he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the curtains swept across them. \u201cRight, well, I\u2019m a busy man, so let\u2019s get down to business. First of all, we need to discuss your security.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied, \u201cI am perfectly happy with the security I\u2019ve already got, thank you very \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re not,\u201d Scrimgeour cut in. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse. The new secretary in your outer office \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re suggesting!\u201d said the Prime Minister hotly. \u201cHe\u2019s highly efficient, gets through twice the work the rest of them \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s a wizard,\u201d said Scrimgeour, without a flicker of a smile. \u201cA highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you for your protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, wait a moment!\u201d declared the Prime Minister. \u201cYou can\u2019t just put your people into my office, I decide who works for me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?\u201d said Scrimgeour coldly.\n\n\u201cI am \u2014 that\u2019s to say, I was \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s no problem, is there?\u201d said Scrimgeour.\n\n\u201cI . . . well, as long as Shacklebolt\u2019s work continues to be . . . er . . . excellent,\u201d said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him.\n\n\u201cNow, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d asked the Prime Minister.\n\n\u201cHe has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cIt\u2019s addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s only quacking!\u201d said the Prime Minister weakly. \u201cSurely a bit of a rest . . . Maybe go easy on the drink . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cA team of Healers from St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of them,\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cI think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . well . . . He\u2019ll be all right, won\u2019t he?\u201d said the Prime Minister anxiously.\n\nScrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back toward the fireplace.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of developments, Prime Minister \u2014 or, at least, I shall probably be too busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here. He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.\u201d\n\nFudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely looked as though he had a toothache. Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green. The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last.\n\n\u201cBut for heaven\u2019s sake \u2014 you\u2019re wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out \u2014 well \u2014 anything!\u201d\n\nScrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, \u201cThe trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter2": "SPINNER\u2019S END\n\n\n\n\nMany miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime Minister\u2019s windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown, rubbish-strewn banks. An immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and ominous. There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass.\n\nBut then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.\n\nWith a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d\n\nThe harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead.\n\nThe second figure turned over the animal with its toe.\n\n\u201cJust a fox,\u201d said a woman\u2019s voice dismissively from under the hood. \u201cI thought perhaps an Auror \u2014 Cissy, wait!\u201d\n\nBut her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of light, was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down.\n\n\u201cCissy \u2014 Narcissa \u2014 listen to me \u2014\u201d\n\nThe second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the other wrenched it away.\n\n\u201cGo back, Bella!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must listen to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve listened already. I\u2019ve made my decision. Leave me alone!\u201d\n\nThe woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled street. The other woman, Bella, followed at once. Side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.\n\n\u201cHe lives here?\u201d asked Bella in a voice of contempt. \u201cHere? In this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.\n\n\u201cCissy, wait!\u201d\n\nBella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness. The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other.\n\n\u201cCissy, you must not do this, you can\u2019t trust him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord trusts him, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord is . . . I believe . . . mistaken,\u201d Bella panted, and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone. \u201cIn any case, we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLet go, Bella!\u201d snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the other\u2019s face. Bella merely laughed.\n\n\u201cCissy, your own sister? You wouldn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing I wouldn\u2019t do anymore!\u201d Narcissa breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister\u2019s arm as though burned.\n\n\u201cNarcissa!\u201d\n\nBut Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinner\u2019s End, over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.\n\nShe had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.\n\nNarcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person.\n\n\u201cNarcissa!\u201d said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that the light fell upon her and her sister too. \u201cWhat a pleasant surprise!\u201d\n\n\u201cSeverus,\u201d she said in a strained whisper. \u201cMay I speak to you? It\u2019s urgent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut of course.\u201d\n\nHe stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her still-hooded sister followed without invitation.\n\n\u201cSnape,\u201d she said curtly as she passed him.\n\n\u201cBellatrix,\u201d he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.\n\nThey had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls were completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually inhabited.\n\nSnape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as her sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa.\n\n\u201cSo, what can I do for you?\u201d Snape asked, settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters.\n\n\u201cWe . . . we are alone, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Narcissa asked quietly.\n\n\u201cYes, of course. Well, Wormtail\u2019s here, but we\u2019re not counting vermin, are we?\u201d\n\nHe pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen.\n\n\u201cAs you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,\u201d said Snape lazily.\n\nThe man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his right, which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove.\n\n\u201cNarcissa!\u201d he said, in a squeaky voice. \u201cAnd Bellatrix! How charming \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWormtail will get us drinks, if you\u2019d like them,\u201d said Snape. \u201cAnd then he will return to his bedroom.\u201d\n\nWormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at him.\n\n\u201cI am not your servant!\u201d he squeaked, avoiding Snape\u2019s eye.\n\n\u201cReally? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo assist, yes \u2014 but not to make you drinks and \u2014 and clean your house!\u201d\n\n\u201cI had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous assignments,\u201d said Snape silkily. \u201cThis can be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI can speak to him myself if I want to!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you can,\u201d said Snape, sneering. \u201cBut in the meantime, bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine will do.\u201d\n\nWormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might argue, but then turned and headed through a second hidden door. They heard banging and a clinking of glasses. Within seconds he was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence, slamming the book-covered door behind him.\n\nSnape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters. Narcissa murmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This did not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked rather amused.\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord,\u201d he said, raising his glass and draining it.\n\nThe sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush, \u201cSeverus, I\u2019m sorry to come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only one who can help me \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.\n\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d said Snape. \u201cHe has lately taken to listening at doors, I don\u2019t know what he means by it. . . . You were saying, Narcissa?\u201d\n\nShe took a great, shuddering breath and started again.\n\n\u201cSeverus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you ought to hold your tongue!\u201d snarled Bellatrix. \u201cParticularly in present company!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Present company\u2019?\u201d repeated Snape sardonically. \u201cAnd what am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t trust you, Snape, as you very well know!\u201d\n\nNarcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands. Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrix\u2019s glowering face.\n\n\u201cNarcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say; it will save tedious interruptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix,\u201d said Snape. \u201cWhy is it that you do not trust me?\u201d\n\n\u201cA hundred reasons!\u201d she said loudly, striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. \u201cWhere to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing all these years that you\u2019ve lived in Dumbledore\u2019s pocket? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at your mercy for five years?\u201d\n\nShe paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.\n\nSnape smiled.\n\n\u201cBefore I answer you \u2014 oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer! You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?\u201d\n\nShe hesitated.\n\n\u201cI know he believes you, but . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen?\u201d\n\nBellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued, \u201cYou ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the Dark Lord\u2019s orders that I took up the post?\u201d\n\nShe nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth, but Snape forestalled her.\n\n\u201cYou ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished. For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lucius\u201d \u2014 he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa \u2014 \u201cand many others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is. . . . If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few followers left.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d have me!\u201d said Bellatrix passionately. \u201cI, who spent many years in Azkaban for him!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, indeed, most admirable,\u201d said Snape in a bored voice. \u201cOf course, you weren\u2019t a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGesture!\u201d she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad. \u201cWhile I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing Dumbledore\u2019s pet!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d said Snape calmly. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse . . . tempt me into my old ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your favorite subject?\u201d she jeered. \u201cWhy did you stay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cHardly,\u201d said Snape, \u201calthough the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you stayed \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Bellatrix, I stayed,\u201d said Snape, betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. \u201cI had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you know. Dumbledore\u2019s protection kept me out of jail; it was most convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do.\n\n\u201cI think you next wanted to know,\u201d he pressed on, a little more loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, \u201cwhy I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore\u2019s stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.\u201d\n\nBellatrix\u2019s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine.\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t return when he came back, you didn\u2019t fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect. I returned two hours later. I returned on Dumbledore\u2019s orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Dumbledore\u2019s \u2014 ?\u201d she began, in tones of outrage.\n\n\u201cThink!\u201d said Snape, impatient again. \u201cThink! By waiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the Dark Lord\u2019s side because I was ordered to, I have been able to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for months. I knew he must be about to return, all the Death Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to escape like Karkaroff, didn\u2019t I?\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord\u2019s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely, I assure you, when I explained that I remained faithful, although Dumbledore thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever, but he was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what use have you been?\u201d sneered Bellatrix. \u201cWhat useful information have we had from you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord,\u201d said Snape. \u201cIf he chooses not to share it with you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe shares everything with me!\u201d said Bellatrix, firing up at once. \u201cHe calls me his most loyal, his most faithful \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he?\u201d said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief. \u201cDoes he still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was not my fault!\u201d said Bellatrix, flushing. \u201cThe Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious \u2014 if Lucius hadn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare \u2014 don\u2019t you dare blame my husband!\u201d said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.\n\n\u201cThere is no point apportioning blame,\u201d said Snape smoothly. \u201cWhat is done, is done.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut not by you!\u201d said Bellatrix furiously. \u201cNo, you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, Snape?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy orders were to remain behind,\u201d said Snape. \u201cPerhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix? And \u2014 forgive me \u2014 you speak of dangers . . . you were facing six teenagers, were you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order before long!\u201d snarled Bellatrix. \u201cAnd, while we are on the subject of the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name of the place. You understand how the enchantment works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit for finishing him off.\u201d\n\nHe inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did not soften.\n\n\u201cYou are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have not done it. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?\u201d asked Snape.\n\n\u201cHe . . . lately, we . . . I am asking you, Snape!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou claim you foresaw his use of the boy!\u201d she jeered.\n\n\u201cI do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year ago. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why did you keep him alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore\u2019s protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord\u2019s attack. Indeed, many of the Dark Lord\u2019s old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle.\n\n\u201cOf course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you?\u201d asked Bellatrix. \u201cHe has no idea of your true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have played my part well,\u201d said Snape. \u201cAnd you overlook Dumbledore\u2019s greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open arms \u2014 though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard \u2014 oh yes, he has,\u201d (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), \u201cthe Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord.\u201d\n\nBellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape turned to her sister.\n\n\u201cNow . . . you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?\u201d\n\nNarcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.\n\n\u201cYes, Severus. I \u2014 I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and . . .\u201d\n\nShe closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids.\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,\u201d Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. \u201cHe wishes none to know of the plan. It is . . . very secret. But \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,\u201d said Snape at once. \u201cThe Dark Lord\u2019s word is law.\u201d\n\nNarcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water. Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d she said triumphantly to her sister. \u201cEven Snape says so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!\u201d\n\nBut Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window, peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.\n\n\u201cIt so happens that I know of the plan,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cI am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you must know about it!\u201d said Narcissa, breathing more freely. \u201cHe trusts you so, Severus. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know about the plan?\u201d said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. \u201cYou know?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Snape. \u201cBut what help do you require, Narcissa? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeverus,\u201d she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks. \u201cMy son . . . my only son . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDraco should be proud,\u201d said Bellatrix indifferently. \u201cThe Dark Lord is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Draco: He isn\u2019t shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to prove himself, excited at the prospect \u2014\u201d\n\nNarcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius\u2019s mistake, I know it!\u201d\n\nSnape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s chosen Draco, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she persisted. \u201cTo punish Lucius?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Draco succeeds,\u201d said Snape, still looking away from her, \u201che will be honored above all others.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he won\u2019t succeed!\u201d sobbed Narcissa. \u201cHow can he, when the Dark Lord himself \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.\n\n\u201cI only meant . . . that nobody has yet succeeded. . . . Severus . . . please . . . You are, you have always been, Draco\u2019s favorite teacher. . . . You are Lucius\u2019s old friend. . . . I beg you. . . . You are the Dark Lord\u2019s favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . . Will you speak to him, persuade him \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid enough to attempt it,\u201d said Snape flatly. \u201cI cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!\u201d choked Narcissa. \u201cHe does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!\u201d\n\nWhen Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little self-restraint she still possessed. Standing up, she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears falling onto his chest, she gasped, \u201cYou could do it. You could do it instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would, and he would reward you beyond all of us \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands. Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, \u201cHe intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, it doesn\u2019t matter to him if Draco is killed!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord is very angry,\u201d repeated Snape quietly. \u201cHe failed to hear the prophecy. You know as well as I do, Narcissa, that he does not forgive easily.\u201d\n\nShe crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the floor.\n\n\u201cMy only son . . . my only son . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should be proud!\u201d said Bellatrix ruthlessly. \u201cIf I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!\u201d\n\nNarcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up, and steered her back onto the sofa. He then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand.\n\n\u201cNarcissa, that\u2019s enough. Drink this. Listen to me.\u201d\n\nShe quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky sip.\n\n\u201cIt might be possible . . . for me to help Draco.\u201d\n\nShe sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge.\n\n\u201cSeverus \u2014 oh, Severus \u2014 you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can try.\u201d\n\nShe flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape\u2019s feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and pressed her lips to it.\n\n\u201cIf you are there to protect him . . . Severus, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Unbreakable Vow?\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, however, let out a cackle of triumphant laughter.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he\u2019ll try, I\u2019m sure. . . . The usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action . . . oh, on the Dark Lord\u2019s orders, of course!\u201d\n\nSnape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissa\u2019s tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.\n\n\u201cCertainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cPerhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder.\u201d\n\nBellatrix\u2019s mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath Bellatrix\u2019s astonished gaze, they grasped right hands.\n\n\u201cYou will need your wand, Bellatrix,\u201d said Snape coldly.\n\nShe drew it, still looking astonished.\n\n\u201cAnd you will need to move a little closer,\u201d he said.\n\nShe stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands.\n\nNarcissa spoke.\n\n\u201cWill you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord\u2019s wishes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Snape.\n\nA thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire.\n\n\u201cAnd will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Snape.\n\nA second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first, making a fine, glowing chain.\n\n\u201cAnd, should it prove necessary . . . if it seems Draco will fail . . .\u201d whispered Narcissa (Snape\u2019s hand twitched within hers, but he did not draw away), \u201cwill you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?\u201d\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon their clasped hands, her eyes wide.\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Snape.\n\nBellatrix\u2019s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a rope, like a fiery snake."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter3": "WILL AND WON\u2019T\n\n\n\n\nHarry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses askew and his mouth wide open. The misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair.\n\nThe room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, and sweet wrappers littered the floor, a number of spellbooks lay higgledy-piggledy among the tangled robes on his bed, and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk. The headline of one blared:\n\nHARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?\n\nRumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted once more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to talk about it, don\u2019t ask me anything,\u201d said one agitated Obliviator, who refused to give his name as he left the Ministry last night.\n\nNevertheless, highly placed sources within the Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy.\n\nThough Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place, a growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person ever known to have survived the Killing Curse, and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question. Some are going so far as to call Potter \u201cthe Chosen One,\u201d believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.\n\nThe current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it exists, are unknown, although (ctd. page 2, column 5)\n\n\n\n\n\nA second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore the headline:\n\nSCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE\n\n\n\nMost of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-white picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face. The picture was moving \u2014 the man was waving at the ceiling.\n\nRufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community, though rumors of a rift between the new Minister and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours of Scrimgeour taking office.\n\nScrimgeour\u2019s representatives admitted that he had met with Dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job, but refused to comment on the topics under discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to (ctd. page 3, column 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the left of this paper sat another, which had been folded so that a story bearing the title MINISTRY GUARANTEES STUDENTS\u2019 SAFETY was visible.\n\nNewly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this autumn.\n\n\u201cFor obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans,\u201d said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the protection of Hogwarts School.\n\nMost seem reassured by the new Minister\u2019s tough stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta Longbottom, \u201cMy grandson, Neville \u2014 a good friend of Harry Potter\u2019s, incidentally, who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and \u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep to hear her.\n\nA large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was open; it looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear, sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that coated the very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 ISSUED ON BEHALF OF \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Ministry of Magic\n\n\n\nPROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCES\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and your home from attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. You are advised not to leave the house alone.\n\n2. Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness. Wherever possible, arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen.\n\n3. Review the security arrangements around your house, making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment Charms, and, in the case of underage family members, Side-Along-Apparition.\n\n4. Agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2).\n\n5. Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been put under the Imperius Curse (see page 4).\n\n6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact the Auror office immediately.\n\n7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any sighting of an Inferius, or encounter with same, should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago, ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it, held in place by Harry\u2019s relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat.\n\nDear Harry,\n\nIf it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven P.M. to escort you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays.\n\nIf you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when I see you.\n\nKindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to see you this Friday,\n\nI am, yours most sincerely,\n\nAlbus Dumbledore\n\n\n\n\n\nThough he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o\u2019clock that evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore\u2019s words; Harry had sent back his \u201cyes\u201d with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was going to come, or he was not.\n\nBut Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong \u2014 his reply to Dumbledore\u2019s letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.\n\nThe minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and, at that precise moment, the streetlamp outside the window went out.\n\nHarry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm. Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path.\n\nHarry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, \u201cWho the blazes is calling at this time of night?\u201d\n\nHarry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. He had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky and close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, \u201cGood evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?\u201d\n\nHarry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm\u2019s reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and a pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore\u2019s, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes.\n\n\u201cJudging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,\u201d said Dumbledore pleasantly. \u201cHowever, let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.\u201d\n\nHe stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him.\n\n\u201cIt is a long time since my last visit,\u201d said Dumbledore, peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. \u201cI must say, your agapanthus are flourishing.\u201d\n\nVernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him, and soon \u2014 the vein pulsing in his uncle\u2019s temple was reaching danger point \u2014 but something about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully.\n\n\u201cAh, good evening Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking up at him through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression. \u201cExcellent, excellent.\u201d\n\nThese words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say \u201cexcellent\u201d was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude \u2014\u201d he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable.\n\n\u201c\u2014 yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,\u201d Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. \u201cBest to say nothing at all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.\u201d\n\nThe kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry\u2019s aunt, wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly halfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen surfaces. Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock.\n\n\u201cAlbus Dumbledore,\u201d said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction. \u201cWe have corresponded, of course.\u201d Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term. \u201cAnd this must be your son, Dudley?\u201d\n\nDudley had that moment peered round the living room door. His large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear. Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything, but as the silence stretched on he smiled.\n\n\u201cShall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room?\u201d\n\nDudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t \u2014 aren\u2019t we leaving, sir?\u201d Harry asked anxiously.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd I would prefer not to do so in the open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle\u2019s hospitality only a little longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will, will you?\u201d\n\nVernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder, and Dudley skulking behind them both.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore simply, \u201cI shall.\u201d\n\nHe drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position.\n\n\u201cWe may as well be comfortable,\u201d said Dumbledore pleasantly.\n\nAs he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away.\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 what happened to your \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cLater, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cPlease sit down.\u201d\n\nHarry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.\n\n\u201cI would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,\u201d Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, \u201cbut the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.\u201d\n\nA third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then floated to each person in the room.\n\n\u201cMadam Rosmerta\u2019s finest oak-matured mead,\u201d said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.\n\n\u201cWell, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, turning toward him, \u201ca difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us, I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that Sirius\u2019s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.\u201d\n\nOver on the sofa, Uncle Vernon\u2019s head turned, but Harry did not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, \u201cOh. Right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is, in the main, fairly straightforward,\u201d Dumbledore went on. \u201cYou add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius\u2019s personal possessions. The slightly problematic part of the legacy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHis godfather\u2019s dead?\u201d said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa. Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon\u2019s head; he attempted to beat it away. \u201cHe\u2019s dead? His godfather?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys. \u201cOur problem,\u201d he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, \u201cis that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been left a house?\u201d said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him.\n\n\u201cYou can keep using it as headquarters,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t care. You can have it, I don\u2019t really want it.\u201d Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.\n\n\u201cThat is generous,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have, however, vacated the building temporarily.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead, \u201cBlack family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of \u2018Black.\u2019 Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.\u201d\n\nA vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius\u2019s mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry\u2019s mind. \u201cI bet there has,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cQuite,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd if such an enchantment exists, then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius\u2019s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.\u201d\n\nWithout realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius\u2019s killer, inherit his house?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell, obviously we would prefer that she didn\u2019t get it either,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cThe situation is fraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it, for example, making it Unplottable, will hold now that ownership has passed from Sirius\u2019s hands. It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how are you going to find out if I\u2019m allowed to own it?\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunately,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cthere is a simple test.\u201d\n\nHe placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but before he could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, \u201cWill you get these ruddy things off us?\u201d\n\nHarry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his wand again. All three glasses vanished. \u201cBut it would have been better manners to drink it, you know.\u201d\n\nIt looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledore\u2019s wand.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, \u201cif you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited \u2014\u201d\n\nHe flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat\u2019s ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys\u2019 shag carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher,\u201d finished Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cKreacher won\u2019t, Kreacher won\u2019t, Kreacher won\u2019t!\u201d croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears. \u201cKreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won\u2019t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won\u2019t, won\u2019t, won\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you can see, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher\u2019s continued croaks of \u201cwon\u2019t, won\u2019t, won\u2019t,\u201d \u201cKreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf. \u201cI don\u2019t want him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t, won\u2019t, won\u2019t, won\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t, won\u2019t, won\u2019t, won\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.\n\n\u201cGive him an order,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cIf he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t, won\u2019t, won\u2019t, WON\u2019T!\u201d\n\nKreacher\u2019s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, \u201cKreacher, shut up!\u201d\n\nIt looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.\n\n\u201cWell, that simplifies matters,\u201d said Dumbledore cheerfully. \u201cIt seems that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I \u2014 do I have to keep him with me?\u201d Harry asked, aghast, as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.\n\n\u201cNot if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cIf I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry in relief, \u201cyeah, I\u2019ll do that. Er \u2014 Kreacher \u2014 I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves.\u201d\n\nKreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThere is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry at once, \u201che can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid will be delighted,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cHe was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak\u2019s safety, to rechristen him \u2018Witherwings\u2019 for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDoubtful that I would turn up?\u201d Dumbledore suggested shrewdly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just go and \u2014 er \u2014 finish off,\u201d said Harry hastily, hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.\n\nIt took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-change ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron. Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig\u2019s cage in the other, he made his way back downstairs.\n\nHe was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living room.\n\nNobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said, \u201cProfessor \u2014 I\u2019m ready now.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cJust one last thing, then.\u201d And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more.\n\n\u201cAs you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year\u2019s time \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledore\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d said Dumbledore politely.\n\n\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders doesn\u2019t turn eighteen until the year after next.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Dumbledore pleasantly, \u201cbut in the Wizarding world, we come of age at seventeen.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon muttered, \u201cPreposterous,\u201d but Dumbledore ignored him.\n\n\u201cNow, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country. The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents\u2019 murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own.\u201d\n\nDumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together.\n\n\u201cYou did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.\u201d\n\nBoth Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them.\n\n\u201cUs \u2014 mistreat Dudders? What d\u2019you \u2014 ?\u201d began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his finger for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.\n\n\u201cThe magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house \u2018home.\u2019 However miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen; in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this: that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time.\u201d\n\nNone of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.\n\n\u201cWell, Harry . . . time for us to be off,\u201d said Dumbledore at last, standing up and straightening his long black cloak. \u201cUntil we meet again,\u201d he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing his hat, he swept from the room.\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry\u2019s trunk, upon which Hedwig\u2019s cage was perched.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to be encumbered by these just now,\u201d he said, pulling out his wand again. \u201cI shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak . . . just in case.\u201d\n\nHarry extracted his Cloak from his trunk with some difficulty, trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool, misty darkness.\n\n\u201cAnd now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\u201d"}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter4": "HORACE SLUGHORN\n\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping desperately that Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him, Harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before; there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened Harry\u2019s sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledore\u2019s most prized possessions.\n\nDumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed.\n\n\u201cKeep your wand at the ready, Harry,\u201d he said brightly.\n\n\u201cBut I thought I\u2019m not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is an attack,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cI give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are with me,\u201d said Dumbledore simply. \u201cThis will do, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.\n\n\u201cYou have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI thought you had to be seventeen?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cSo you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly. My left, if you don\u2019t mind \u2014 as you have noticed, my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.\u201d\n\nHarry gripped Dumbledore\u2019s proffered forearm.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWell, here we go.\u201d\n\nHarry felt Dumbledore\u2019s arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then \u2014\u201d\n\nHe gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His comprehension catching up with his senses, Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d asked Dumbledore, looking down at him solicitously. \u201cThe sensation does take some getting used to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. \u201cBut I think I might prefer brooms. . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more tightly around his neck, and said, \u201cThis way.\u201d\n\nHe set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses. According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.\n\n\u201cSo tell me, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYour scar . . . has it been hurting at all?\u201d\n\nHarry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightning-shaped mark.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemort\u2019s getting so powerful again.\u201d\n\nHe glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression.\n\n\u201cI, on the other hand, thought otherwise,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cLord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not complaining,\u201d said Harry, who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Voldemort\u2019s mind.\n\nThey turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter. Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again. \u201cProfessor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 where exactly are we?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are we doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes, of course, I haven\u2019t told you,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWell, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can I help with that, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I think we\u2019ll find a use for you,\u201d said Dumbledore vaguely. \u201cLeft here, Harry.\u201d\n\nThey proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All the windows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too. Thinking of dementors, Harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.\n\n\u201cProfessor, why couldn\u2019t we just Apparate directly into your old colleague\u2019s house?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cCourtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. In any case, most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 you can\u2019t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cHermione Granger told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she is quite right. We turn left again.\u201d\n\nThe church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established, he had more pressing questions to ask.\n\n\u201cSir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street. \u201cHe has been replaced, as I am sure you also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head of the Auror office.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he . . . Do you think he\u2019s good?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cAn interesting question,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but I meant \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.\u201d\n\nHarry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported, and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed it. \u201cAnd . . . sir . . . I saw about Madam Bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cA terrible loss. She was a great witch. Just up here, I think \u2014 ouch.\u201d\n\nHe had pointed with his injured hand.\n\n\u201cProfessor, what happened to your \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no time to explain now,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cIt is a thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.\u201d\n\nHe smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not being snubbed, and that he had permission to keep asking questions.\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security measures we should all take against the Death Eaters. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I received one myself,\u201d said Dumbledore, still smiling. \u201cDid you find it useful?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t . . .\u201d Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not.\n\n\u201cFor future reference, Harry, it is raspberry . . . although of course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . right,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasn\u2019t very clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are corpses,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cDead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard\u2019s bidding. Inferi have not been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last powerful. . . . He killed enough people to make an army of them, of course. This is the place, Harry, just here. . . .\u201d\n\nThey were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the front gate, Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him.\n\n\u201cOh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.\u201d\n\nHarry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink. The front door was hanging off its hinges.\n\nDumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite deserted.\n\n\u201cWand out and follow me, Harry,\u201d he said quietly.\n\nHe opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly, his wand raised and at the ready.\n\n\u201cLumos.\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s wand-tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow hallway. To the left, another door stood open. Holding his illuminated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him.\n\nA scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier glittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, feathers oozing from slashes in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Harry\u2019s small intake of breath made Dumbledore look around.\n\n\u201cNot pretty, is it?\u201d he said heavily. \u201cYes, something horrible has happened here.\u201d\n\nDumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry followed, gazing around, half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.\n\n\u201cMaybe there was a fight and \u2014 and they dragged him off, Professor?\u201d Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side.\n\n\u201cYou mean he\u2019s \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cStill here somewhere? Yes.\u201d\n\nAnd without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled, \u201cOuch!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Horace,\u201d said Dumbledore, straightening up again.\n\nHarry\u2019s jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye.\n\n\u201cThere was no need to stick the wand in that hard,\u201d he said gruffly, clambering to his feet. \u201cIt hurt.\u201d\n\nThe wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes, his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached Dumbledore\u2019s chin.\n\n\u201cWhat gave it away?\u201d he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still rubbing his lower belly. He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.\n\n\u201cMy dear Horace,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking amused, \u201cif the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house.\u201d\n\nThe wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.\n\n\u201cThe Dark Mark,\u201d he muttered. \u201cKnew there was something . . . ah well. Wouldn\u2019t have had time anyway, I\u2019d only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.\u201d\n\nHe heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter.\n\n\u201cWould you like my assistance clearing up?\u201d asked Dumbledore politely.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said the other.\n\nThey stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion.\n\nThe furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments re-formed in midair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited; a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of blood was that, incidentally?\u201d asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather clock.\n\n\u201cOn the walls? Dragon,\u201d shouted the wizard called Horace, as, with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.\n\nThere was a final plunk from the piano, and silence.\n\n\u201cYes, dragon,\u201d repeated the wizard conversationally. \u201cMy last bottle, and prices are sky-high at the moment. Still, it might be reusable.\u201d\n\nHe stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid within.\n\n\u201cHmm. Bit dusty.\u201d\n\nHe set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry.\n\n\u201cOho,\u201d he said, his large round eyes flying to Harry\u2019s forehead and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. \u201cOho!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the introduction, \u201cis Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.\u201d\n\nSlughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression shrewd. \u201cSo that\u2019s how you thought you\u2019d persuade me, is it? Well, the answer\u2019s no, Albus.\u201d\n\nHe pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation.\n\n\u201cI suppose we can have a drink, at least?\u201d asked Dumbledore. \u201cFor old time\u2019s sake?\u201d\n\nSlughorn hesitated.\n\n\u201cAll right then, one drink,\u201d he said ungraciously.\n\nDumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated, which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp. Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as visible as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.\n\n\u201cHmpf,\u201d he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes. \u201cHere \u2014\u201d He gave a drink to Dumbledore, who had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.\n\n\u201cWell, how have you been keeping, Horace?\u201d Dumbledore asked.\n\n\u201cNot so well,\u201d said Slughorn at once. \u201cWeak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can\u2019t move like I used to. Well, that\u2019s to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYou can\u2019t have had more than three minutes\u2019 warning?\u201d\n\nSlughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, \u201cTwo. Didn\u2019t hear my Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath. Still,\u201d he added sternly, seeming to pull himself back together again, \u201cthe fact remains that I\u2019m an old man, Albus. A tired old man who\u2019s earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts.\u201d\n\nHe certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not yet as old as I am, Horace,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,\u201d said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledore\u2019s injured hand. \u201cReactions not what they were, I see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the sight of them made the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickle unpleasantly. \u201cI am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand . . .\u201d\n\nHe shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. Slughorn\u2019s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.\n\n\u201cSo, all these precautions against intruders, Horace . . . are they for the Death Eaters\u2019 benefit, or mine?\u201d asked Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWhat would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down old buffer like me?\u201d demanded Slughorn.\n\n\u201cI imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion, torture, and murder,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAre you really telling me that they haven\u2019t come recruiting yet?\u201d\n\nSlughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, \u201cI haven\u2019t given them the chance. I\u2019ve been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house \u2014 the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands \u2014 it\u2019s been very pleasant, I\u2019ll be sorry to leave. It\u2019s quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors don\u2019t spot you bringing in the piano.\u201d\n\n\u201cIngenious,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now, if you were to return to Hogwarts \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school, you can save your breath, Albus! I might have been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left! If that\u2019s how you treat teachers these days \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs \u2018filthy half-breeds.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what she did, did she?\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cIdiotic woman. Never liked her.\u201d\n\nHarry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry said hastily. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 I didn\u2019t like her either.\u201d\n\nDumbledore stood up rather suddenly.\n\n\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful.\n\n\u201cNo, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. \u201cSecond on the left down the hall.\u201d\n\nDumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had closed behind him, there was silence. After a few moments, Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a furtive look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it, warming his wide behind.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s brought you,\u201d he said abruptly.\n\nHarry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn\u2019s watery eyes slid over Harry\u2019s scar, this time taking in the rest of his face.\n\n\u201cYou look very like your father.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been told,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cExcept for your eyes. You\u2019ve got \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s eyes, yeah.\u201d Harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing.\n\n\u201cHmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn\u2019t have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother,\u201d Slughorn added, in answer to Harry\u2019s questioning look. \u201cLily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich was your House?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was Head of Slytherin,\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cOh, now,\u201d he went on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry\u2019s face and wagging a stubby finger at him, \u201cdon\u2019t go holding that against me! You\u2019ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done \u2014 been in the papers for the last couple of years \u2014 died a few weeks ago \u2014\u201d\n\nIt was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry\u2019s intestines and held them tight.\n\n\u201cWell, anyway, he was a big pal of your father\u2019s at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame \u2014 he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I\u2019d have liked the set.\u201d\n\nHe sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction. Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.\n\n\u201cYour mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn\u2019t believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of my best friends is Muggle-born,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand she\u2019s the best in our year.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny how that sometimes happens, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Slughorn.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Harry coldly.\n\nSlughorn looked down at him in surprise. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t think I\u2019m prejudiced!\u201d he said. \u201cNo, no, no! Haven\u2019t I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorite students? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too \u2014 now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course \u2014 another Muggle-born, a very gifted student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on at Gringotts!\u201d\n\nHe bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way, and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants.\n\n\u201cAll ex-students, all signed. You\u2019ll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor of the Daily Prophet, he\u2019s always interested to hear my take on the day\u2019s news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes \u2014 a hamper every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job! And at the back \u2014 you\u2019ll see her if you just crane your neck \u2014 that\u2019s Gwenog Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies. . . . People are always astonished to hear I\u2019m on first-name terms with the Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!\u201d\n\nThis thought seemed to cheer him up enormously.\n\n\u201cAnd all these people know where to find you, to send you stuff?\u201d asked Harry, who could not help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets, Quidditch tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him.\n\nThe smile slid from Slughorn\u2019s face as quickly as the blood from his walls.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, looking down at Harry. \u201cI have been out of touch with everybody for a year.\u201d\n\nHarry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a moment. Then he shrugged.\n\n\u201cStill . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times. All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while I\u2019m sure they\u2019re very admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don\u2019t personally fancy the mortality rate \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice: It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn\u2019s cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats. \u201cMost of the teachers aren\u2019t in it, and none of them has ever been killed \u2014 well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort.\u201d\n\nHarry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemort\u2019s name spoken aloud, and was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest, which Harry ignored.\n\n\u201cI reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore\u2019s headmaster; he\u2019s supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Harry went on.\n\nSlughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to be thinking over Harry\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cWell, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has never sought a fight with Dumbledore,\u201d he muttered grudgingly. \u201cAnd I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Eaters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend . . . in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albus. . . . I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones\u2019s death did not shake me. . . . If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house.\n\n\u201cOh, there you are, Albus,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a very long time. Upset stomach?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon Horace\u2019s hospitality quite long enough; I think it is time for us to leave.\u201d\n\nNot at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. Slughorn seemed taken aback.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.\u201d\n\n\u201cLost . . . ?\u201d\n\nSlughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t want the job, Horace,\u201d said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. \u201cHogwarts would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit, should you wish to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes . . . well . . . very gracious . . . as I say . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-bye, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThey were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d\n\nDumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room.\n\n\u201cYou will come out of retirement?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Slughorn impatiently. \u201cI must be mad, but yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming. \u201cThen, Horace, we shall see you on the first of September.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I daresay you will,\u201d grunted Slughorn.\n\nAs they set off down the garden path, Slughorn\u2019s voice floated after them, \u201cI\u2019ll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!\u201d\n\nDumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist.\n\n\u201cWell done, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Harry in surprise.\n\n\u201cOh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . .\u201d\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born should make a good witch.\n\n\u201cHorace,\u201d said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, \u201clikes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat \u2014 more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office.\u201d\n\nHarry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.\n\n\u201cI tell you all this,\u201d Dumbledore continued, \u201cnot to turn you against Horace \u2014 or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn \u2014 but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel of his collection; \u2018the Boy Who Lived\u2019 . . . or, as they call you these days, \u2018the Chosen One.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survives . . .\n\nDumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed earlier.\n\n\u201cThis will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.\u201d\n\nBraced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow. In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there . . . and so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he knew. . . .\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, as they passed through the gate, \u201cI\u2019d like a few words with you before we part. In private. Perhaps in here?\u201d\n\nDumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at Harry.\n\n\u201cI hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say \u201cHis godfather\u2019s dead?\u201d and even worse to hear Sirius\u2019s name thrown out casually by Slughorn.\n\n\u201cIt was cruel,\u201d said Dumbledore softly, \u201cthat you and Sirius had such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledore\u2019s hat. He could tell that Dumbledore understood, that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived, Harry had spent nearly all his time at the Dursleys\u2019 lying on his bed, refusing meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just hard,\u201d Harry said finally, in a low voice, \u201cto realize he won\u2019t write to me again.\u201d\n\nHis eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather . . . and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again. . . .\n\n\u201cSirius represented much to you that you had never known before,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cNaturally, the loss is devastating. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut while I was at the Dursleys\u2019 . . .\u201d interrupted Harry, his voice growing stronger, \u201cI realized I can\u2019t shut myself away or \u2014 or crack up. Sirius wouldn\u2019t have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life\u2019s too short. . . . Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance. . . . It could be me next, couldn\u2019t it? But if it is,\u201d he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore\u2019s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpoken both like your mother and father\u2019s son and Sirius\u2019s true godson!\u201d said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harry\u2019s back. \u201cI take my hat off to you \u2014 or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders.\n\n\u201cAnd now, Harry, on a closely related subject . . . I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster.\n\n\u201cThen you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry again. \u201cAnd now everyone knows that I\u2019m the one \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they do not,\u201d interrupted Dumbledore. \u201cThere are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and they are both standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true, however, that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.\n\n\u201cNow, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cA wise decision, on the whole,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAlthough I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,\u201d he continued, when Harry looked startled, \u201cI think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 to worry or frighten them?\u201d said Dumbledore, surveying Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles. \u201cOr perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to require an answer. He continued, \u201cOn a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrivate \u2014 with you?\u201d said Harry, surprised out of his preoccupied silence.\n\n\u201cYes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you be teaching me, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, a little of this, a little of that,\u201d said Dumbledore airily.\n\nHarry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not elaborate, so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m having lessons with you, I won\u2019t have to do Occlumency lessons with Snape, will I?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, Harry \u2014 and no, you will not.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Harry in relief, \u201cbecause they were a \u2014\u201d\n\nHe stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.\n\n\u201cI think the word \u2018fiasco\u2019 would be a good one here,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding.\n\nHarry laughed.\n\n\u201cWell, that means I won\u2019t see much of Professor Snape from now on,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause he won\u2019t let me carry on Potions unless I get \u2018Outstanding\u2019 in my O.W.L., which I know I haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t count your owls before they are delivered,\u201d said Dumbledore gravely. \u201cWhich, now I think of it, ought to be some time later today. Now, two more things, Harry, before we part.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all times from this moment onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just in case, you understand me?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cAnd lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly \u2014 all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cVery well, then,\u201d said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard. \u201cI see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.\u201d"}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter5": "AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM\n\n\n\n\nHarry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs. Weasley\u2019s. \u201cDeclare yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.\u201d\n\nThe door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short, plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown.\n\n\u201cHarry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not to expect you before morning!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were lucky,\u201d said Dumbledore, ushering Harry over the threshold. \u201cSlughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected. Harry\u2019s doing, of course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!\u201d\n\nHarry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone, despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heart-shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.\n\n\u201cHello, Professor,\u201d she said. \u201cWotcher, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Tonks.\u201d\n\nHarry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in her smile. Certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubble-gum-pink hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d better be off,\u201d she said quickly, standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders. \u201cThanks for the tea and sympathy, Molly.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave on my account,\u201d said Dumbledore courteously, \u201cI cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, I need to get going,\u201d said Tonks, not meeting Dumbledore\u2019s eyes. \u201c\u2019Night \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and Mad-Eye are coming \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, really, Molly . . . thanks anyway . . . Good night, everyone.\u201d\n\nTonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled.\n\n\u201cWell, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cTake care of yourself. Molly, your servant.\u201d\n\nHe made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, vanishing at precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re like Ron,\u201d she sighed, looking him up and down. \u201cBoth of you look as though you\u2019ve had Stretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron\u2019s grown four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d said Harry, suddenly realizing just how hungry he was.\n\n\u201cSit down, dear, I\u2019ll knock something up.\u201d\n\nAs Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto his knees and settled there, purring.\n\n\u201cSo Hermione\u2019s here?\u201d he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears.\n\n\u201cOh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in bed, of course, we didn\u2019t expect you for hours. Here you are \u2014\u201d\n\nShe tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Harry, and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.\n\n\u201cBread, dear?\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Mrs. Weasley.\u201d\n\nShe waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table; as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down opposite him.\n\n\u201cSo you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak.\n\n\u201cHe taught Arthur and me,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cHe was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I think. Did you like him?\u201d\n\nHis mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.\n\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely. \u201cOf course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Arthur\u2019s never liked him much. The Ministry\u2019s littered with Slughorn\u2019s old favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had much time for Arthur \u2014 didn\u2019t seem to think he was enough of a highflier. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes. I don\u2019t know whether Ron\u2019s told you in any of his letters \u2014 it\u2019s only just happened \u2014 but Arthur\u2019s been promoted!\u201d\n\nIt could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this.\n\nHarry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d he gasped.\n\n\u201cYou are sweet,\u201d beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. \u201cYes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation, and Arthur\u2019s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. It\u2019s a big job, he\u2019s got ten people reporting to him now!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat exactly \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters. You can imagine the kind of thing \u2014 so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off. . . . Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Fletcher, who\u2019ve never done an honest day\u2019s work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, it\u2019s a very important job, and I tell him it\u2019s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.\u201d Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.\n\n\u201cIs Mr. Weasley still at work?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cYes, he is. As a matter of fact, he\u2019s a tiny bit late. . . . He said he\u2019d be back around midnight. . . .\u201d\n\nShe turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table. Harry recognized it at once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member, and usually hung on the Weasleys\u2019 sitting room wall, though its current position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her. Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at \u201cmortal peril.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like that for a while now,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, \u201cever since You-Know-Who came back into the open. I suppose everybody\u2019s in mortal danger now. . . . I don\u2019t think it can be just our family . . . but I don\u2019t know anyone else who\u2019s got a clock like this, so I can\u2019t check. Oh!\u201d\n\nWith a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock\u2019s face. Mr. Weasley\u2019s hand had switched to \u201ctraveling.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried to it; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly, \u201cArthur, is that you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d came Mr. Weasley\u2019s weary voice. \u201cBut I would say that even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, honestly . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMolly!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right . . . What is your dearest ambition?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo find out how airplanes stay up.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side, because the door remained firmly shut.\n\n\u201cMolly! I\u2019ve got to ask you your question first!\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur, really, this is just silly. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you like me to call you when we\u2019re alone together?\u201d\n\nEven by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl.\n\n\u201cMollywobbles,\u201d whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door.\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cNow you can let me in.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn-rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t see why we have to go through that every time you come home,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak. \u201cI mean, a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, dear, but it\u2019s Ministry procedure, and I have to set an example. Something smells good \u2014 onion soup?\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.\n\n\u201cHarry! We didn\u2019t expect you until morning!\u201d\n\nThey shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too.\n\n\u201cThanks, Molly. It\u2019s been a tough night. Some idiot\u2019s started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them around your neck and you\u2019ll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all for ten Galleons!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what really happens when you put them on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their bodies. As if St. Mungo\u2019s didn\u2019t have enough to do already!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. \u201cAre you sure \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I am!\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cThe boys wouldn\u2019t do anything like that now, not when people are desperate for protection!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo is that why you\u2019re late, Metamorph-Medals?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stifled a yawn behind his hand.\n\n\u201cBed,\u201d said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. \u201cI\u2019ve got Fred and George\u2019s room all ready for you, you\u2019ll have it to yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, where are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they\u2019re so busy,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cI must say, I didn\u2019t approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! Come on, dear, your trunk\u2019s already up there.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Night, Mr. Weasley,\u201d said Harry, pushing back his chair. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room.\n\n\u201cG\u2019night, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\nHarry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands were once again at \u201cmortal peril.\u201d\n\nFred and George\u2019s bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window, their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry\u2019s school trunk. The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.\n\nHedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds. There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was instantly asleep.\n\nSeconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other.\n\n\u201cWuzzgoinon?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know you were here already!\u201d said a loud and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head.\n\n\u201cRon, don\u2019t hit him!\u201d said a girl\u2019s voice reproachfully.\n\nHarry\u2019s hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though the light was so bright he could hardly see anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.\n\n\u201cAll right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever been better,\u201d said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it. \u201cWhen did you get here? Mum\u2019s only just told us!\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout one o\u2019clock this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame as usual,\u201d said Harry, as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed, \u201cthey didn\u2019t talk to me much, but I like it better that way. How\u2019re you, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Hermione, who was scrutinizing Harry as though he was sickening for something. He thought he knew what was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Sirius\u2019s death or any other miserable subject at the moment, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the time? Have I missed breakfast?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, Mum\u2019s bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed,\u201d said Ron, rolling his eyes. \u201cSo, what\u2019s been going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing much, I\u2019ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle\u2019s, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome off it!\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou\u2019ve been off with Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement. His name\u2019s Horace Slughorn.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Ron, looking disappointed. \u201cWe thought \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack at top speed.\n\n\u201c\u2014 we thought it\u2019d be something like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d said Harry, amused.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, don\u2019t we? So, er, what\u2019s he like?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of Slytherin,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSomething wrong, Hermione?\u201d\n\nShe was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment. She rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile.\n\n\u201cNo, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like he\u2019ll be a good teacher?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe can\u2019t be worse than Umbridge, can he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know someone who\u2019s worse than Umbridge,\u201d said a voice from the doorway. Ron\u2019s younger sister slouched into the room, looking irritable. \u201cHi, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s her,\u201d said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry\u2019s bed. \u201cShe\u2019s driving me mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she done now?\u201d asked Hermione sympathetically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way she talks to me \u2014 you\u2019d think I was about three!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Hermione, dropping her voice. \u201cShe\u2019s so full of herself.\u201d\n\nHarry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs. Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily, \u201cCan\u2019t you two lay off her for five seconds?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s right, defend her,\u201d snapped Ginny. \u201cWe all know you can\u2019t get enough of her.\u201d\n\nThis seemed an odd comment to make about Ron\u2019s mother. Starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, \u201cWho are you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut his question was answered before he could finish it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto the floor.\n\nA young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.\n\n\u201c\u2019Arry,\u201d she said in a throaty voice. \u201cEet \u2019as been too long!\u201d\n\nAs she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. Weasley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake, looking rather cross.\n\n\u201cThere was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do it myself!\u201d\n\n\u201cEet was no trouble,\u201d said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across Harry\u2019s knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn. \u201cI \u2019ave been longing to see \u2019im. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never stops talking about \u2019Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . is she here too?\u201d Harry croaked.\n\n\u201cNo, no, silly boy,\u201d said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, \u201cI mean next summer, when we \u2014 but do you not know?\u201d\n\nHer great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at Mrs. Weasley, who said, \u201cWe hadn\u2019t got around to telling him yet.\u201d\n\nFleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.\n\n\u201cBill and I are going to be married!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one another\u2019s gaze. \u201cWow. Er \u2014 congratulations!\u201d\n\nShe swooped down upon him and kissed him again.\n\n\u201cBill is very busy at ze moment, working very \u2019ard, and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me \u2019ere for a few days to get to know \u2019is family properly. I was so pleased to \u2019ear you would be coming \u2014 zere isn\u2019t much to do \u2019ere, unless you like cooking and chickens! Well \u2014 enjoy your breakfast, \u2019Arry!\u201d\n\nWith these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.\n\nMrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like \u201ctchah!\u201d\n\n\u201cMum hates her,\u201d said Ginny quietly.\n\n\u201cI do not hate her!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. \u201cI just think they\u2019ve hurried into this engagement, that\u2019s all!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve known each other a year,\u201d said Ron, who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not very long! I know why it\u2019s happened, of course. It\u2019s all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they\u2019re rushing all sorts of decisions they\u2019d normally take time over. It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and center \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIncluding you and Dad,\u201d said Ginny slyly.\n\n\u201cYes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was the point in waiting?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cWhereas Bill and Fleur . . . well . . . what have they really got in common? He\u2019s a hardworking, down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA cow,\u201d said Ginny, nodding. \u201cBut Bill\u2019s not that down-to-earth. He\u2019s a Curse-Breaker, isn\u2019t he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour. . . . I expect that\u2019s why he\u2019s gone for Phlegm.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop calling her that, Ginny,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Harry and Hermione laughed. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better get on. . . . Eat your eggs while they\u2019re warm, Harry.\u201d\n\nLooking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get used to her if she\u2019s staying in the same house?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cWell, you do,\u201d said Ron, \u201cbut if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pathetic,\u201d said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really want her around forever?\u201d Ginny asked Ron incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, \u201cWell, Mum\u2019s going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s she going to manage that?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cShe keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think she\u2019s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I hope he does, I\u2019d much rather have her in the family.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019ll work,\u201d said Ron sarcastically. \u201cListen, no bloke in his right mind\u2019s going to fancy Tonks when Fleur\u2019s around. I mean, Tonks is okay-looking when she isn\u2019t doing stupid things to her hair and her nose, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s more intelligent, she\u2019s an Auror!\u201d said Hermione from the corner.\n\n\u201cFleur\u2019s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNot you as well!\u201d said Hermione bitterly.\n\n\u201cI suppose you like the way Phlegm says \u2018\u2019Arry,\u2019 do you?\u201d asked Ginny scornfully.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, wishing he hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cI was just saying, Phlegm \u2014 I mean, Fleur \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d much rather have Tonks in the family,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cAt least she\u2019s a laugh.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been much of a laugh lately,\u201d said Ron. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve seen her she\u2019s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d snapped Hermione. \u201cShe still hasn\u2019t got over what happened . . . you know . . . I mean, he was her cousin!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.\n\n\u201cTonks and Sirius barely knew each other!\u201d said Ron. \u201cSirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cShe thinks it was her fault he died!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does she work that one out?\u201d asked Harry, in spite of himself.\n\n\u201cWell, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn\u2019t she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn\u2019t have killed Sirius.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s survivor\u2019s guilt,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI know Lupin\u2019s tried to talk her round, but she\u2019s still really down. She\u2019s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!\u201d\n\n\u201cWith her \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t change her appearance like she used to,\u201d explained Hermione. \u201cI think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that could happen,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNor did I,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cbut I suppose if you\u2019re really depressed . . .\u201d\n\nThe door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in. \u201cGinny,\u201d she whispered, \u201ccome downstairs and help me with the lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking to this lot!\u201d said Ginny, outraged.\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew.\n\n\u201cShe only wants me there so she doesn\u2019t have to be alone with Phlegm!\u201d said Ginny crossly. She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina.\n\n\u201cYou lot had better come down quickly too,\u201d she said as she left.\n\nHarry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and George\u2019s boxes, though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry. Ron, who was now helping himself to Harry\u2019s toast, was still gazing dreamily at the door.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Hermione asked eventually, holding up what looked like a small telescope.\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Ron, \u201cbut if Fred and George\u2019ve left it here, it\u2019s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mum said the shop\u2019s going well,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSaid Fred and George have got a real flair for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an understatement,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey\u2019re raking in the Galleons! I can\u2019t wait to see the place, we haven\u2019t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says Dad\u2019s got to be there for extra security and he\u2019s been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what about Percy?\u201d asked Harry; the third-eldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family. \u201cIs he talking to your mum and dad again?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cBut he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI heard him telling your mum, Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be giving me private lessons this year,\u201d said Harry conversationally.\n\nRon choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.\n\n\u201cYou kept that quiet!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI only just remembered,\u201d said Harry honestly. \u201cHe told me last night in your broom shed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey . . . private lessons with Dumbledore!\u201d said Ron, looking impressed. \u201cI wonder why he\u2019s . . . ?\u201d\n\nHis voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to do it. . . . Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly why he\u2019s going to be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.\u201d\n\nNeither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the impression that both had frozen. He continued, still speaking to his fork, \u201cYou know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody knows what it said, though,\u201d said Hermione quickly. \u201cIt got smashed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the Prophet says \u2014\u201d began Ron, but Hermione said, \u201cShh!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Prophet\u2019s got it right,\u201d said Harry, looking up at them both with a great effort: Hermione seemed frightened and Ron amazed. \u201cThat glass ball that smashed wasn\u2019t the only record of the prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore\u2019s office, he was the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what it said,\u201d Harry took a deep breath, \u201cit looks like I\u2019m the one who\u2019s got to finish off Voldemort. . . . At least, it said neither of us could live while the other survives.\u201d\n\nThe three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.\n\nHermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye.\n\n\u201cI squeezed it and it \u2014 it punched me!\u201d she gasped.\n\nAnd sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh, \u201cMum\u2019ll fix that, she\u2019s good at healing minor injuries \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh well, never mind that now!\u201d said Hermione hastily. \u201cHarry, oh, Harry . . .\u201d\n\nShe sat down on the edge of his bed again.\n\n\u201cWe wondered, after we got back from the Ministry . . . Obviously, we didn\u2019t want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like this. . . . Oh, Harry . . .\u201d She stared at him, then whispered, \u201cAre you scared?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot as much as I was,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhen I first heard it, I was . . . but now, it seems as though I always knew I\u2019d have to face him in the end. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy,\u201d said Ron eagerly. \u201cAnd we were kind of right, weren\u2019t we? He wouldn\u2019t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldn\u2019t waste his time \u2014 he must think you\u2019ve got a chance!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019ll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probably . . . powerful countercurses . . . anti-jinxes . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.\n\n\u201c. . . and evasive enchantments generally,\u201d concluded Hermione. \u201cWell, at least you know one lesson you\u2019ll be having this year, that\u2019s one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our O.W.L. results will come?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be long now, it\u2019s been a month,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Harry, as another part of last night\u2019s conversation came back to him. \u201cI think Dumbledore said our O.W.L. results would be arriving today!\u201d\n\n\u201cToday?\u201d shrieked Hermione. \u201cToday? But why didn\u2019t you \u2014 oh my God \u2014 you should have said \u2014\u201d\n\nShe leapt to her feet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see whether any owls have come. . . .\u201d\n\nBut when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs. Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.\n\n\u201cIt just won\u2019t budge,\u201d Mrs. Weasley was saying anxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of The Healer\u2019s Helpmate open at \u201cBruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.\u201d \u201cThis has always worked before, I just can\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be Fred and George\u2019s idea of a funny joke, making sure it can\u2019t come off,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s got to come off!\u201d squeaked Hermione. \u201cI can\u2019t go around looking like this forever!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t, dear, we\u2019ll find an antidote, don\u2019t worry,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley soothingly.\n\n\u201cBill told me \u2019ow Fred and George are very amusing!\u201d said Fleur, smiling serenely.\n\n\u201cYes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,\u201d snapped Hermione.\n\nShe jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen, twisting her fingers together.\n\n\u201cMrs. Weasley, you\u2019re quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, dear, I\u2019d have noticed,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley patiently. \u201cBut it\u2019s barely nine, there\u2019s still plenty of time. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I messed up Ancient Runes,\u201d muttered Hermione feverishly, \u201cI definitely made at least one serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all. I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking back \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, will you shut up, you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s nervous!\u201d barked Ron. \u201cAnd when you\u2019ve got your ten \u2018Outstanding\u2019 O.W.L.s . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione, flapping her hands hysterically. \u201cI know I\u2019ve failed everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens if we fail?\u201d Harry asked the room at large, but it was again Hermione who answered.\n\n\u201cWe discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten less breakfast.\n\n\u201cAt Beauxbatons,\u201d said Fleur complacently, \u201cwe \u2019ad a different way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then \u2014\u201d\n\nFleur\u2019s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione was pointing through the kitchen window. Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing larger all the time.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely owls,\u201d said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join Hermione at the window.\n\n\u201cAnd there are three of them,\u201d said Harry, hastening to her other side.\n\n\u201cOne for each of us,\u201d said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \u201cOh no . . . oh no . . . oh no . . .\u201d\n\nShe gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows.\n\nThe owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.\n\n\u201cOh no!\u201d squealed Hermione.\n\nMrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs.\n\nHarry moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to detach his own results; to his right, Hermione\u2019s hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble.\n\nNobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside.\n\nORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL RESULTS\n\nPass Grades\n\nOUTSTANDING (O)\n\nEXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS (E)\n\nACCEPTABLE (A)\n\n\n\nFail Grades\n\nPOOR (P)\n\nDREADFUL (D)\n\nTROLL (T)\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry James Potter has achieved:\n\nAstronomy A\n\nCare of Magical Creatures E\n\nCharms E\n\nDefense Against the Dark Arts O\n\nDivination P\n\nHerbology E\n\nHistory of Magic D\n\nPotions E\n\nTransfiguration E\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry read the parchment through several times, his breathing becoming easier with each reading. It was all right: He had always known that he would fail Divination, and he had had no chance of passing History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination, but he had passed everything else! He ran his finger down the grades . . . he had passed well in Transfiguration and Herbology, he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And best of all, he had achieved \u201cOutstanding\u201d at Defense Against the Dark Arts!\n\nHe looked around. Hermione had her back to him and her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted.\n\n\u201cOnly failed Divination and History of Magic, and who cares about them?\u201d he said happily to Harry. \u201cHere \u2014 swap \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry glanced down Ron\u2019s grades: There were no \u201cOutstandings\u201d there. . . .\n\n\u201cKnew you\u2019d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,\u201d said Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve done all right, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell done!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ron\u2019s hair. \u201cSeven O.W.L.s, that\u2019s more than Fred and George got together!\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione?\u201d said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still hadn\u2019t turned around. \u201cHow did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 not bad,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice.\n\n\u201cOh, come off it,\u201d said Ron, striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand. \u201cYep \u2014 nine \u2018Outstandings\u2019 and one \u2018Exceeds Expectations\u2019 at Defense Against the Dark Arts.\u201d He looked down at her, half-amused, half-exasperated. \u201cYou\u2019re actually disappointed, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHermione shook her head, but Harry laughed.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re N.E.W.T. students now!\u201d grinned Ron. \u201cMum, are there any more sausages?\u201d\n\nHarry looked back down at his results. They were as good as he could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny twinge of regret. . . . This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not secured the required Potions grade. He had known all along that he wouldn\u2019t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E.\n\nIt was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn\u2019t really think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago. . . . Neither can live while the other survives. . . . Wouldn\u2019t he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort?"}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter6": "DRACO\u2019S DETOUR\n\n\n\n\nHarry remained within the confines of the Burrow\u2019s garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys\u2019 orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.\n\nIt would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it not been for the stories of disappearances, odd accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet. Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. To Mrs. Weasley\u2019s displeasure, Harry\u2019s sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.\n\n\u201cThere have been another couple of dementor attacks,\u201d he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve found Igor Karkaroff\u2019s body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it \u2014 well, frankly, I\u2019m surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters; Sirius\u2019s brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, well,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, \u201cperhaps we should talk about something diff \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?\u201d asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur. \u201cThe man who ran \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?\u201d Harry interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. \u201cHe used to give me free ice creams. What\u2019s happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cDragged off, by the look of his place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill.\n\n\u201cWho knows? He must\u2019ve upset them somehow. He was a good man, Florean.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalking of Diagon Alley,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, \u201clooks like Ollivander\u2019s gone too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wandmaker?\u201d said Ginny, looking startled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one. Shop\u2019s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut wands \u2014 what\u2019ll people do for wands?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll make do with other makers,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cBut Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got him it\u2019s not so good for us.\u201d\n\nThe day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harry\u2019s included a surprise: He had been made Quidditch Captain.\n\n\u201cThat gives you equal status with prefects!\u201d cried Hermione happily. \u201cYou can use our special bathroom now and everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,\u201d said Ron, examining the badge with glee. \u201cHarry, this is so cool, you\u2019re my Captain \u2014 if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you\u2019ve got these,\u201d sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking down Ron\u2019s booklist. \u201cWe\u2019ll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn\u2019t have to go into work again. I\u2019m not going there without him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMum, d\u2019you honestly think You-Know-Who\u2019s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?\u201d sniggered Ron.\n\n\u201cFortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, firing up at once. \u201cIf you think security\u2019s a laughing matter you can stay behind and I\u2019ll get your things myself \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George\u2019s shop!\u201d said Ron hastily.\n\n\u201cThen you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide you\u2019re too immature to come with us!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley angrily, snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still pointing at \u201cmortal peril,\u201d and balancing it on top of a pile of just-laundered towels. \u201cAnd that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!\u201d\n\nRon turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room.\n\n\u201cBlimey . . . you can\u2019t even make a joke round here anymore. . . .\u201d\n\nBut Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Ginny\u2019s pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s mine?\u201d demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s already Harry\u2019s, idiot,\u201d said Bill. \u201cI got it out of your vault for you, Harry, because it\u2019s taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his . . . Well, trust me, this way\u2019s easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Bill,\u201d said Harry, pocketing his gold.\n\n\u201c\u2019E is always so thoughtful,\u201d purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill\u2019s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.\n\nIt was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once before, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling on their cloaks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good Dad can get us these again,\u201d said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it, it\u2019s only because of Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa. \u201cHe\u2019s been given top-grade security status. And we\u2019ll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his Cloak.\n\n\u201cHere you are, then,\u201d said the driver, a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. \u201cI\u2019m to wait for you, any idea how long you\u2019ll be?\u201d\n\n\u201cA couple of hours, I expect,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cAh, good, he\u2019s here!\u201d\n\nHarry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry\u2019s face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of the car. \u201cBuckbeak \u2014 Witherwings, I mean \u2014 yeh should see him, Harry, he\u2019s so happy ter be back in the open air \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad he\u2019s pleased,\u201d said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know \u2018security\u2019 meant you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, jus\u2019 like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o\u2019 Aurors, but Dumbledore said I\u2019d do,\u201d said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. \u201cLet\u2019s get goin\u2019 then \u2014 after yeh, Molly, Arthur \u2014\u201d\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry\u2019s memory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said importantly, \u201cJus\u2019 passin\u2019 through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know.\u201d\n\nTom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Harry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around.\n\nDiagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescue\u2019s Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned to its front:\n\nAMULETS\n\nEffective Against Werewolves, Dementors, and Inferi\n\n\n\nA seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby.\n\n\u201cOne for your little girl, madam?\u201d he called at Mrs. Weasley as they passed, leering at Ginny. \u201cProtect her pretty neck?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were on duty . . .\u201d said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the amulet seller.\n\n\u201cYes, but don\u2019t go arresting anyone now, dear, we\u2019re in a hurry,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a list. \u201cI think we\u2019d better do Madam Malkin\u2019s first, Hermione wants new dress robes, and Ron\u2019s showing much too much ankle in his school robes, and you must need new ones too, Harry, you\u2019ve grown so much \u2014 come on, everyone \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMolly, it doesn\u2019t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin\u2019s,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cWhy don\u2019t those three go with Hagrid, and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone\u2019s schoolbooks?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack. \u201cHagrid, do you think \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 fret, they\u2019ll be fine with me, Molly,\u201d said Hagrid soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid. Mrs. Weasley did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkin\u2019s.\n\nHarry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried, anxious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone.\n\n\u201cMigh\u2019 be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,\u201d said Hagrid, stopping outside Madam Malkin\u2019s and bending down to peer through the window. \u201cI\u2019ll stand guard outside, all right?\u201d\n\nSo Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop together. It appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue.\n\n\u201c. . . not a child, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.\u201d\n\nThere was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, \u201cNow, dear, your mother\u2019s quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore, it\u2019s nothing to do with being a child \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWatch where you\u2019re sticking that pin, will you!\u201d\n\nA teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves. He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected over his shoulder. His light gray eyes narrowed.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just walked in,\u201d said Draco Malfoy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for language like that!\u201d said Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want wands drawn in my shop either!\u201d she added hastily, for a glance toward the door had shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, who was standing slightly behind them, whispered, \u201cNo, don\u2019t, honestly, it\u2019s not worth it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, like you\u2019d dare do magic out of school,\u201d sneered Malfoy. \u201cWho blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite enough!\u201d said Madam Malkin sharply, looking over her shoulder for support. \u201cMadam \u2014 please \u2014\u201d\n\nNarcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack.\n\n\u201cPut those away,\u201d she said coldly to Harry and Ron. \u201cIf you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, still resembled her sister\u2019s. He was as tall as she was now. \u201cGoing to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in, are you?\u201d\n\nMadam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.\n\n\u201cReally, you shouldn\u2019t accuse \u2014 dangerous thing to say \u2014 wands away, please!\u201d\n\nBut Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly.\n\n\u201cI see that being Dumbledore\u2019s favorite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won\u2019t always be there to protect you.\u201d\n\nHarry looked mockingly all around the shop. \u201cWow . . . look at that . . . he\u2019s not here now! So why not have a go? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband!\u201d\n\nMalfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!\u201d Malfoy snarled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Draco,\u201d said Narcissa, restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder. \u201cI expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.\u201d\n\nHarry raised his wand higher.\n\n\u201cHarry, no!\u201d moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side. \u201cThink. . . . You mustn\u2019t. . . . You\u2019ll be in such trouble. . . .\u201d\n\nMadam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it wouldn\u2019t. She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at Harry.\n\n\u201cI think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let me just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re putting your pins, woman! Mother \u2014 I don\u2019t think I want these anymore \u2014\u201d\n\nHe pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at Madam Malkin\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Draco,\u201d said Narcissa, with a contemptuous glance at Hermione, \u201cnow I know the kind of scum that shops here. . . . We\u2019ll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out.\n\n\u201cWell, really!\u201d said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner, so that it removed all the dust.\n\nShe was distracted all through the fitting of Ron\u2019s and Harry\u2019s new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizard\u2019s dress robes instead of witch\u2019s, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them.\n\n\u201cGot ev\u2019rything?\u201d asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side.\n\n\u201cJust about,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDid you see the Malfoys?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, unconcerned. \u201cBu\u2019 they wouldn\u2019 dare make trouble in the middle o\u2019 Diagon Alley, Harry. Don\u2019 worry abou\u2019 them.\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared, all clutching heavy packages of books.\n\n\u201cEveryone all right?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cGot your robes? Right then, we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George\u2019s \u2014 stick close, now. . . .\u201d\n\nNeither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions, but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium. Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every minute or so, they headed farther along the street in search of Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred and George.\n\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t got too long,\u201d Mrs. Weasley said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just have a quick look around and then back to the car. We must be close, that\u2019s number ninety-two . . . ninety-four . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Ron, stopping in his tracks.\n\nSet against the dull, poster-muffled shop fronts around them, Fred and George\u2019s windows hit the eye like a firework display. Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few rather stunned-looking people had actually come to a halt, transfixed. The left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and shrieked; Harry\u2019s eyes began to water just looking at it. The right-hand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters:\n\nWHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHO?\n\nYOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT U-NO-POO \u2014\n\nTHE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT\u2019S GRIPPING THE NATION!\n\n\n\nHarry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name \u201cU-No-Poo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be murdered in their beds!\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cNo they won\u2019t!\u201d said Ron, who, like Harry, was laughing. \u201cThis is brilliant!\u201d\n\nAnd he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was packed with customers; Harry could not get near the shelves. He stared around, looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfinished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf. There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: REUSABLE HANGMAN \u2014 SPELL IT OR HE\u2019LL SWING!\n\n\u201c\u2018Patented Daydream Charms . . .\u2019\u201d\n\nHermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship.\n\n\u201c\u2018One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality, highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens.\u2019 You know,\u201d said Hermione, looking up at Harry, \u201cthat really is extraordinary magic!\u201d\n\n\u201cFor that, Hermione,\u201d said a voice behind them, \u201cyou can have one for free.\u201d\n\nA beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair.\n\n\u201cHow are you, Harry?\u201d They shook hands. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happened to your eye, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour punching telescope,\u201d she said ruefully.\n\n\u201cOh blimey, I forgot about those,\u201d said Fred. \u201cHere \u2014\u201d\n\nHe pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste.\n\n\u201cJust dab it on, that bruise\u2019ll be gone within the hour,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe had to find a decent bruise remover. We\u2019re testing most of our products on ourselves.\u201d\n\nHermione looked nervous. \u201cIt is safe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course it is,\u201d said Fred bracingly. \u201cCome on, Harry, I\u2019ll give you a tour.\u201d\n\nHarry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks.\n\n\u201cMuggle magic tricks!\u201d said Fred happily, pointing them out. \u201cFor freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. It\u2019s not a big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they\u2019re great novelties. . . . Oh, here\u2019s George. . . .\u201d\n\nFred\u2019s twin shook Harry\u2019s hand energetically.\n\n\u201cGiving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, that\u2019s where we\u2019re making the real money \u2014 pocket anything, you, and you\u2019ll pay in more than Galleons!\u201d he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled EDIBLE DARK MARKS \u2014 THEY\u2019LL MAKE ANYONE SICK!\n\nGeorge pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just developed this more serious line,\u201d said Fred. \u201cFunny how it happened . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can\u2019t do a decent Shield Charm,\u201d said George. \u201c\u2019Course, they didn\u2019t have you teaching them, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. . . . Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we\u2019re still getting massive orders!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . I mean, they wouldn\u2019t help much against the Unforgivable Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then we thought we\u2019d get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts, because it\u2019s such a money spinner,\u201d continued George enthusiastically. \u201cThis is cool. Look, Instant Darkness Powder, we\u2019re importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make a quick escape.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves, look,\u201d said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight. \u201cYou just drop one surreptitiously and it\u2019ll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHandy,\u201d said Harry, impressed.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d said George, catching a couple and throwing them to Harry.\n\nA young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called \u201cMr. Weasley,\u201d but they took it in their stride.\n\n\u201cRight you are, Verity, I\u2019m coming,\u201d said George promptly. \u201cHarry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that!\u201d said Harry, who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t pay here,\u201d said Fred firmly, waving away Harry\u2019s gold.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gave us our start-up loan, we haven\u2019t forgotten,\u201d said George sternly. \u201cTake whatever you like, and just remember to tell people where you got it, if they ask.\u201d\n\nGeorge swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet?\u201d asked Fred. \u201cFollow me, ladies. . . .\u201d\n\nNear the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary.\n\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d said Fred proudly. \u201cBest range of love potions you\u2019ll find anywhere.\u201d\n\nGinny raised an eyebrow skeptically. \u201cDo they work?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cCertainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and the attractiveness of the girl,\u201d said George, reappearing suddenly at their side. \u201cBut we\u2019re not selling them to our sister,\u201d he added, becoming suddenly stern, \u201cnot when she\u2019s already got about five boys on the go from what we\u2019ve \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever you\u2019ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,\u201d said Ginny calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201cGuaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,\u201d said Fred. \u201cExcellent on everything from boils to blackheads, but don\u2019t change the subject. Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cAnd last time I looked, he was definitely one boy, not five. What are those?\u201d\n\nShe was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks.\n\n\u201cPygmy Puffs,\u201d said George. \u201cMiniature puffskeins, we can\u2019t breed them fast enough. So what about Michael Corner?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dumped him, he was a bad loser,\u201d said Ginny, putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it. \u201cThey\u2019re really cute!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re fairly cuddly, yes,\u201d conceded Fred. \u201cBut you\u2019re moving through boyfriends a bit fast, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nGinny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didn\u2019t recoil.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. And I\u2019ll thank you,\u201d she added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at George\u2019s elbow, laden with merchandise, \u201cnot to tell tales about me to these two!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,\u201d said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron\u2019s arms. \u201cCough up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your brother!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s our stuff you\u2019re nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I\u2019ll knock off the Knut.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right shelves.\u201d\n\nRon dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who had chosen that moment to appear.\n\n\u201cIf I see you do that again I\u2019ll jinx your fingers together,\u201d she said sharply.\n\n\u201cMum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?\u201d said Ginny at once.\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley warily.\n\n\u201cLook, they\u2019re so sweet. . . .\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window. Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone. As he passed Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him.\n\n\u201cWonder where his mummy is?\u201d said Harry, frowning.\n\n\u201cGiven her the slip by the looks of it,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWhy, though?\u201d said Hermione.\n\nHarry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches. Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not be innocent.\n\nHe glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing with his back to them, looking up and down the street.\n\n\u201cGet under here, quick,\u201d said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 I don\u2019t know, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d said Ron.\n\nShe hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the Cloak with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all too interested in Fred and George\u2019s products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could, but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had.\n\n\u201cHe was going in that direction,\u201d murmured Harry as quietly as possible, so that the humming Hagrid would not hear them. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nThey scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed ahead.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she whispered. \u201cTurning left?\u201d\n\n\u201cBig surprise,\u201d whispered Ron.\n\nFor Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight.\n\n\u201cQuick, or we\u2019ll lose him,\u201d said Harry, speeding up.\n\n\u201cOur feet\u2019ll be seen!\u201d said Hermione anxiously, as the Cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the Cloak nowadays.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Harry impatiently. \u201cJust hurry!\u201d\n\nBut Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts \u2014 or at least, to be seen buying them.\n\nHermione gave his arm a hard pinch.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d\n\n\u201cShh! Look! He\u2019s in there!\u201d she breathed in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\nThey had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them, just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father. Judging by the movements of Malfoy\u2019s hands, he was talking animatedly. The proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man, stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.\n\n\u201cIf only we could hear what they\u2019re saying!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWe can!\u201d said Ron excitedly. \u201cHang on \u2014 damn \u2014\u201d\n\nHe dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest.\n\n\u201cExtendable Ears, look!\u201d\n\n\u201cFantastic!\u201d said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the long, flesh-colored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door. \u201cOh, I hope the door isn\u2019t Imperturbable \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Ron gleefully. \u201cListen!\u201d\n\nThey put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings, through which Malfoy\u2019s voice could be heard loud and clear, as though a radio had been turned on.\n\n\u201c. . . you know how to fix it?\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. \u201cI\u2019ll need to see it, though. Why don\u2019t you bring it into the shop?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cIt\u2019s got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.\u201d\n\nHarry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.\n\n\u201cWell, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job, perhaps impossible. I couldn\u2019t guarantee anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo?\u201d said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. \u201cPerhaps this will make you more confident.\u201d\n\nHe moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very frightened.\n\n\u201cTell anyone,\u201d said Malfoy, \u201cand there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He\u2019s a family friend. He\u2019ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you\u2019re giving the problem your full attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will be no need for \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll decide that,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better be off. And don\u2019t forget to keep that one safe, I\u2019ll need it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to take it now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, of course I wouldn\u2019t, you stupid little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just don\u2019t sell it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not . . . sir.\u201d\n\nBorgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy.\n\n\u201cNot a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cNaturally, naturally,\u201d murmured Borgin, bowing again.\n\nNext moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the Cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried.\n\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears.\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Harry, thinking hard. \u201cHe wants something mended . . . and he wants to reserve something in there. . . . Could you see what he pointed at when he said \u2018that one\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he was behind that cabinet \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two stay here,\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat are you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut Hermione had already ducked out from under the Cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry.\n\n\u201cHello, horrible morning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hermione said brightly to Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Humming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display.\n\n\u201cIs this necklace for sale?\u201d she asked, pausing beside a glass-fronted case.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,\u201d said Mr. Borgin coldly.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 er \u2014 no, I haven\u2019t got quite that much,\u201d said Hermione, walking on. \u201cAnd . . . what about this lovely \u2014 um \u2014 skull?\u201d\n\n\u201cSixteen Galleons.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s for sale, then? It isn\u2019t being . . . kept for anyone?\u201d\n\nMr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, that \u2014 er \u2014 boy who was in here just now, Draco Malfoy, well, he\u2019s a friend of mine, and I want to get him a birthday present, but if he\u2019s already reserved anything, I obviously don\u2019t want to get him the same thing, so . . . um . . .\u201d\n\nIt was a pretty lame story in Harry\u2019s opinion, and apparently Borgin thought so too.\n\n\u201cOut,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cGet out!\u201d\n\nHermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the CLOSED sign.\n\n\u201cAh well,\u201d said Ron, throwing the Cloak back over Hermione. \u201cWorth a try, but you were a bit obvious \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, next time you can show me how it\u2019s done, Master of Mystery!\u201d she snapped.\n\nRon and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes, where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxious-looking Mrs. Weasley and Hagrid, who had clearly noticed their absence. Once in the shop, Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak, hid it in his bag, and joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs. Weasley\u2019s accusations, that they had been in the back room all along, and that she could not have looked properly."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter7": "THE SLUG CLUB\n\n\n\n\nHarry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy\u2019s behavior in Knockturn Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy\u2019s face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy\u2019s activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,\u201d said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and George\u2019s room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation. \u201cBut haven\u2019t we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s broken his Hand of Glory,\u201d said Ron vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his broomstick\u2019s bent tail twigs. \u201cRemember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about when he said, \u2018Don\u2019t forget to keep that one safe\u2019?\u201d asked Harry for the umpteenth time. \u201cThat sounded to me like Borgin\u2019s got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou reckon?\u201d said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle.\n\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, \u201cMalfoy\u2019s father\u2019s in Azkaban. Don\u2019t you think Malfoy\u2019d like revenge?\u201d\n\nRon looked up, blinking.\n\n\u201cMalfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my point, I don\u2019t know!\u201d said Harry, frustrated. \u201cBut he\u2019s up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father\u2019s a Death Eater and \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d said Hermione in an anxious voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour scar\u2019s not hurting again, is it?\u201d asked Ron nervously.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Death Eater,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s replaced his father as a Death Eater!\u201d\n\nThere was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. \u201cMalfoy? He\u2019s sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems very unlikely, Harry,\u201d said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice. \u201cWhat makes you think \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Madam Malkin\u2019s. She didn\u2019t touch him, but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve. It was his left arm. He\u2019s been branded with the Dark Mark.\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione looked at each other.\n\n\u201cWell . . .\u201d said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.\n\n\u201cI think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cHe showed Borgin something we couldn\u2019t see,\u201d Harry pressed on stubbornly. \u201cSomething that seriously scared Borgin. It was the Mark, I know it \u2014 he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione exchanged another look.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I still don\u2019t reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join. . . .\u201d\n\nAnnoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny, who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go in the kitchen just now,\u201d she warned him. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Phlegm around.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be careful not to slip in it.\u201d Harry smiled.\n\nSure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling sprouts, looking bad-tempered.\n\n\u201c. . . Bill and I \u2019ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids, Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer. I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold \u2014 pink would of course be \u2019orrible with Ginny\u2019s \u2019air \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Harry!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleur\u2019s monologue. \u201cGood, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. We\u2019ve got Ministry cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Tonks going to be there?\u201d asked Harry, handing over his Quidditch things.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so, she\u2019s been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has let \u2019erself go, zat Tonks,\u201d Fleur mused, examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. \u201cA big mistake if you ask \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur again. \u201cYou\u2019d better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight, if possible, so we don\u2019t have the usual last-minute scramble.\u201d\n\nAnd in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione\u2019s cat, Crookshanks, safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron\u2019s owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginny\u2019s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.\n\n\u201cAu revoir, \u2019Arry,\u201d said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye. Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur\u2019s feet. Furious, red-faced, and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying good-bye.\n\nThere was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King\u2019s Cross Station. Instead, two grim-faced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking the party, marched them into the station without speaking.\n\n\u201cQuick, quick, through the barrier,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. \u201cHarry had better go first, with \u2014\u201d\n\nShe looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly, seized Harry\u2019s upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.\n\n\u201cI can walk, thanks,\u201d said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of the Auror\u2019s grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier, ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later, standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.\n\nHermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an empty compartment.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, looking apologetic. \u201cRon and I\u2019ve got to go to the prefects\u2019 carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I forgot,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get straight on the train, all of you, you\u2019ve only got a few minutes to go,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch. \u201cWell, have a lovely term, Ron. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?\u201d said Harry, making up his mind on the spur of the moment.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.\n\nHarry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations, and secondly, because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger.\n\nHe could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away.\n\n\u201cWhen we were in Diagon Alley,\u201d Harry began, but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace.\n\n\u201cAm I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George\u2019s shop?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, please. You\u2019re talking to the man who raised Fred and George.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . yeah, all right, we weren\u2019t in the back room.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, then, let\u2019s hear the worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility Cloak.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a mere whim?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I thought Malfoy was up to something,\u201d said Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasley\u2019s look of mingled exasperation and amusement. \u201cHe\u2019d given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you did,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned. \u201cWell? Did you find out why?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe went into Borgin and Burkes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like they were a pair. And . . .\u201d\n\nHarry took a deep breath.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think he\u2019s been branded with the Dark Mark. I think he\u2019s replaced his father as a Death Eater.\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said, \u201cHarry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-year-old \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or wouldn\u2019t do?\u201d asked Harry angrily. \u201cMr. Weasley, I\u2019m sorry, but isn\u2019t it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it\u2019s probably something Dark or dangerous, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt it, to be honest, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley slowly. \u201cYou see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you missed something,\u201d said Harry stubbornly.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr. Weasley was humoring him.\n\nThere was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried, \u201cHarry, quickly!\u201d\n\nHe hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train.\n\n\u201cNow, dear, you\u2019re coming to us for Christmas, it\u2019s all fixed with Dumbledore, so we\u2019ll see you quite soon,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move. \u201cYou make sure you look after yourself and \u2014\u201d\n\nThe train was gathering speed.\n\n\u201c\u2014 be good and \u2014\u201d\n\nShe was jogging to keep up now.\n\n\u201c\u2014 stay safe!\u201d\n\nHarry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects\u2019 carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor, chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his trunk.\n\nPeople stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the \u201cChosen One\u201d rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cFancy trying to find a compartment?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Harry, I said I\u2019d meet Dean,\u201d said Ginny brightly. \u201cSee you later.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around: He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.\n\n\u201cHi, Harry!\u201d said a familiar voice from behind him.\n\n\u201cNeville!\u201d said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy struggling toward him.\n\n\u201cHello, Harry,\u201d said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.\n\n\u201cLuna, hi, how are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, thank you,\u201d said Luna. She was clutching a magazine to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside.\n\n\u201cQuibbler still going strong, then?\u201d asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.\n\n\u201cOh yes, circulation\u2019s well up,\u201d said Luna happily.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find seats,\u201d said Harry, and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re even staring at us!\u201d said Neville, indicating himself and Luna. \u201cBecause we\u2019re with you!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,\u201d said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. \u201cOur little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,\u201d said Neville, \u201cbut she was really pleased. Says I\u2019m starting to live up to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!\u201d\n\nHe pulled it out and showed it to Harry.\n\n\u201cCherry and unicorn hair,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cWe think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day \u2014 oi, come back here, Trevor!\u201d\n\nAnd he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom.\n\n\u201cAre we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?\u201d asked Luna, who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler.\n\n\u201cNo point now we\u2019ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?\u201d said Harry, sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.\n\n\u201cI liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI enjoyed the meetings too,\u201d said Luna serenely. \u201cIt was like having friends.\u201d\n\nThis was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.\n\n\u201cYou ask him!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d\n\nAnd one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the door.\n\n\u201cHi, Harry, I\u2019m Romilda, Romilda Vane,\u201d she said loudly and confidently. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us in our compartment? You don\u2019t have to sit with them,\u201d she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville\u2019s bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re friends of mine,\u201d said Harry coldly.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the girl, looking very surprised. \u201cOh. Okay.\u201d\n\nAnd she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.\n\n\u201cPeople expect you to have cooler friends than us,\u201d said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.\n\n\u201cYou are cool,\u201d said Harry shortly. \u201cNone of them was at the Ministry. They didn\u2019t fight with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very nice thing to say,\u201d beamed Luna. Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The Quibbler.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t face him, though,\u201d said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking Trevor in his hand. \u201cYou did. You should hear my gran talk about you. \u2018That Harry Potter\u2019s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!\u2019 She\u2019d give anything to have you as a grandson. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to O.W.L. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration N.E.W.T. with only an \u201cAcceptable,\u201d Harry watched him without really listening.\n\nNeville\u2019s childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry\u2019s had, but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harry\u2019s destiny. The prophecy could have referred to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.\n\nHad Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy. . . . Or would it? Would Neville\u2019s mother have died to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would. . . . But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no \u201cChosen One\u201d at all? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron\u2019s?\n\n\u201cYou all right, Harry? You look funny,\u201d said Neville.\n\nHarry started. \u201cSorry \u2014 I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWrackspurt got you?\u201d asked Luna sympathetically, peering at Harry through her enormous colored spectacles.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 what?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Wrackspurt . . . They\u2019re invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I felt one zooming around in here.\u201d\n\nShe flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each other\u2019s eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch.\n\nThe weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist, then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron and Hermione entered the compartment at last.\n\n\u201cWish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I\u2019m starving,\u201d said Ron longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his stomach. \u201cHi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?\u201d he added, turning to Harry. \u201cMalfoy\u2019s not doing prefect duty. He\u2019s just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we passed.\u201d\n\nHarry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the previous year.\n\n\u201cWhat did he do when he saw you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe usual,\u201d said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand gesture. \u201cNot like him, though, is it? Well \u2014 that is\u201d \u2014 he did the hand gesture again \u2014 \u201cbut why isn\u2019t he out there bullying first years?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn\u2019t this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students?\n\n\u201cMaybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cMaybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI think he\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\nBut before he could expound on his theory, the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P-Potter,\u201d she faltered, as her eyes met Harry\u2019s and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.\n\n\u201cAn invitation,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHarry,\n\nI would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C.\n\nSincerely,\n\nProfessor H.E.F. Slughorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Professor Slughorn?\u201d asked Neville, looking perplexedly at his own invitation.\n\n\u201cNew teacher,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, I suppose we\u2019ll have to go, won\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does he want me for?\u201d asked Neville nervously, as though he was expecting detention.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. \u201cListen,\u201d he added, seized by a sudden brain wave, \u201clet\u2019s go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what he\u2019s up to.\u201d\n\nThis idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the Cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.\n\nWhen they reached compartment C, they saw at once that they were not Slughorn\u2019s only invitees, although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn\u2019s welcome, Harry was the most warmly anticipated.\n\n\u201cHarry, m\u2019boy!\u201d said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat. \u201cGood to see you, good to see you! And you must be Mr. Longbottom!\u201d\n\nNeville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats, which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there, Ginny.\n\n\u201cNow, do you know everyone?\u201d Slughorn asked Harry and Neville. \u201cBlaise Zabini is in your year, of course \u2014\u201d\n\nZabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle.\n\n\u201cThis is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you\u2019ve come across each other \u2014 ? No?\u201d\n\nMcLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry and Neville nodded back at him.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and this is Marcus Belby, I don\u2019t know whether \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBelby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!\u201d Slughorn finished.\n\nGinny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cWell now, this is most pleasant,\u201d said Slughorn cozily. \u201cA chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin. I\u2019ve packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on licorice wands, and a poor old man\u2019s digestive system isn\u2019t quite up to such things. . . . Pheasant, Belby?\u201d\n\nBelby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.\n\n\u201cI was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,\u201d Slughorn told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket of rolls. \u201cOutstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see much of your uncle, Marcus?\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Belby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to choke.\n\n\u201cAnapneo,\u201d said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once.\n\n\u201cNot . . . not much of him, no,\u201d gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.\n\n\u201cWell, of course, I daresay he\u2019s busy,\u201d said Slughorn, looking questioningly at Belby. \u201cI doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work!\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose . . .\u201d said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him. \u201cEr . . . he and my dad don\u2019t get on very well, you see, so I don\u2019t really know much about . . .\u201d\n\nHis voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead.\n\n\u201cNow, you, Cormac,\u201d said Slughorn, \u201cI happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, that was fun, that was,\u201d said McLaggen. \u201cWe went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour \u2014 this was before he became Minister, obviously \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you know Bertie and Rufus too?\u201d beamed Slughorn, now offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed out. \u201cNow tell me . . .\u201d\n\nIt was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well-known or influential \u2014 everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville\u2019s turn next: This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville\u2019s parents, well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of Neville\u2019s interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his parents\u2019 flair.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act. \u201cHarry Potter! Where to begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer!\u201d He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said, \u201c\u2018The Chosen One,\u2019 they\u2019re calling you now!\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, \u201cthere have been rumors for years. . . . I remember when \u2014 well \u2014 after that terrible night \u2014 Lily \u2014 James \u2014 and you survived \u2014 and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary \u2014\u201d\n\nZabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn.\n\n\u201cYeah, Zabini, because you\u2019re so talented . . . at posing. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around Slughorn\u2019s great belly. \u201cYou want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I wouldn\u2019t cross her!\u201d\n\nZabini merely looked contemptuous.\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. \u201cSuch rumors this summer. Of course, one doesn\u2019t know what to believe, the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes \u2014 but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all!\u201d\n\nHarry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him.\n\n\u201cSo modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond \u2014 you were there, then? But the rest of the stories \u2014 so sensational, of course, one doesn\u2019t know quite what to believe \u2014 this fabled prophecy, for instance \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never heard a prophecy,\u201d said Neville, turning geranium pink as he said it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Ginny staunchly. \u201cNeville and I were both there too, and all this \u2018Chosen One\u2019 rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were both there too, were you?\u201d said Slughorn with great interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile.\n\n\u201cYes . . . well . . . it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of course. . . .\u201d Slughorn said, sounding a little disappointed. \u201cI remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) \u2014\u201d\n\nHe meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny.\n\nThe afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the \u201cSlug Club\u201d at Hogwarts. Harry could not wait to leave, but couldn\u2019t see how to do so politely. Finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight.\n\n\u201cGood gracious, it\u2019s getting dark already! I didn\u2019t notice that they\u2019d lit the lamps! You\u2019d better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Harry, Blaise \u2014 any time you\u2019re passing. Same goes for you, miss,\u201d he twinkled at Ginny. \u201cWell, off you go, off you go!\u201d\n\nAs he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He, Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s over,\u201d muttered Neville. \u201cStrange man, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he is a bit,\u201d said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. \u201cHow come you ended up in there, Ginny?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saw me hex Zacharias Smith,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cYou remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him \u2014 when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to get detention, but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter reason for inviting someone than because their mother\u2019s famous,\u201d said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini\u2019s head, \u201cor because their uncle \u2014\u201d\n\nBut he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless but potentially wonderful idea. . . . In a minute\u2019s time, Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins. . . . If Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of the journey left \u2014 Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows \u2014 but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry\u2019s suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you two later,\u201d said Harry under his breath, pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019re you \u2014 ?\u201d asked Neville.\n\n\u201cLater!\u201d whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless.\n\nThe corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this thing?\u201d said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry\u2019s foot.\n\nHarry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle\u2019s lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini\u2019s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the Cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy\u2019s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinson\u2019s lap. Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the Cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy\u2019s forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe\u2019s comic directly below him.\n\n\u201cSo, Zabini,\u201d said Malfoy, \u201cwhat did Slughorn want?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust trying to make up to well-connected people,\u201d said Zabini, who was still glowering at Goyle. \u201cNot that he managed to find many.\u201d\n\nThis information did not seem to please Malfoy.\n\n\u201cWho else had he invited?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u201cMcLaggen from Gryffindor,\u201d said Zabini.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, his uncle\u2019s big in the Ministry,\u201d said Malfoy.\n\n\u201c\u2014 someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot him, he\u2019s a prat!\u201d said Pansy.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,\u201d finished Zabini.\n\nMalfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy\u2019s hand aside.\n\n\u201cHe invited Longbottom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,\u201d said Zabini indifferently.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?\u201d\n\nZabini shrugged.\n\n\u201cPotter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at \u2018the Chosen One,\u2019\u201d sneered Malfoy, \u201cbut that Weasley girl! What\u2019s so special about her?\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of boys like her,\u201d said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction. \u201cEven you think she\u2019s good-looking, don\u2019t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,\u201d said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair.\n\n\u201cWell, I pity Slughorn\u2019s taste. Maybe he\u2019s going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn\u2019t heard I\u2019m on the train, or \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bank on an invitation,\u201d said Zabini. \u201cHe asked me about Nott\u2019s father when I first arrived. They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he\u2019d been caught at the Ministry he didn\u2019t look happy, and Nott didn\u2019t get an invitation, did he? I don\u2019t think Slughorn\u2019s interested in Death Eaters.\u201d\n\nMalfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless laugh.\n\n\u201cWell, who cares what he\u2019s interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher.\u201d Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. \u201cI mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what\u2019s it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?\u201d said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once.\n\n\u201cWell, you never know,\u201d said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk. \u201cI might have \u2014 er \u2014 moved on to bigger and better things.\u201d\n\nCrouched in the luggage rack under his Cloak, Harry\u2019s heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things. Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy\u2019s hair, looking dumbfounded.\n\n\u201cDo you mean \u2014 Him?\u201d\n\nMalfoy shrugged.\n\n\u201cMother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don\u2019t see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it. . . . When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone\u2019s got? Of course he isn\u2019t. . . . It\u2019ll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think you\u2019ll be able to do something for him?\u201d asked Zabini scathingly. \u201cSixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just said, haven\u2019t I? Maybe he doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn\u2019t something that you need to be qualified for,\u201d said Malfoy quietly.\n\nCrabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe-inspiring.\n\n\u201cI can see Hogwarts,\u201d said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. \u201cWe\u2019d better get our robes on.\u201d\n\nHarry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.\n\nHarry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the Cloak, and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.\n\nHarry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and Zabini followed.\n\n\u201cYou go on,\u201d Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. \u201cI just want to check something.\u201d\n\nPansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform. Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.\n\nHarry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend?\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d\n\nWithout warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at Malfoy\u2019s feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position. He couldn\u2019t move a muscle; he could only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly.\n\n\u201cI thought so,\u201d he said jubilantly. \u201cI heard Goyle\u2019s trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back. . . .\u201d\n\nHis eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry\u2019s trainers.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I\u2019ve got you here . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he stamped, hard, on Harry\u2019s face. Harry felt his nose break; blood spurted everywhere.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s from my father. Now, let\u2019s see. . . .\u201d\n\nMalfoy dragged the Cloak out from under Harry\u2019s immobilized body and threw it over him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon they\u2019ll find you till the train\u2019s back in London,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cSee you around, Potter . . . or not.\u201d\n\nAnd taking care to tread on Harry\u2019s fingers, Malfoy left the compartment."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter8": "SNAPE VICTORIOUS\n\n\n\n\nHarry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow, hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone, surely, would check the compartments before the train departed again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him.\n\nHarry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in . . . and now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of trunks and the loud babble of talk.\n\nRon and Hermione would think that he had left the train without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt, would be halfway back to London.\n\nHe tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible. Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand, which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words \u201cAccio Wand!\u201d over and over again in his head, but nothing happened.\n\nHe thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.\n\nThe train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it. . . .\n\nThen he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, \u201cWotcher, Harry.\u201d\n\nThere was a flash of red light and Harry\u2019s body unfroze; he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily wipe the blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand, and raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better get out of here, quickly,\u201d she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station. \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll jump.\u201d\n\nHarry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view.\n\nThe cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak.\n\n\u201cWho did it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDraco Malfoy,\u201d said Harry bitterly. \u201cThanks for . . . well . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-looking as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. \u201cI can fix your nose if you stand still.\u201d\n\nHarry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes.\n\n\u201cEpiskey,\u201d said Tonks.\n\nHarry\u2019s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be mended.\n\n\u201cThanks a lot!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better put that Cloak back on, and we can walk up to the school,\u201d said Tonks, still unsmiling. As Harry swung the Cloak back over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.\n\n\u201cWas that a Patronus?\u201d asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sending word to the castle that I\u2019ve got you or they\u2019ll worry. Come on, we\u2019d better not dawdle.\u201d\n\nThey set off toward the lane that led to the school.\n\n\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI noticed you hadn\u2019t left the train and I knew you had that Cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I\u2019d check.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you doing here, anyway?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection,\u201d said Tonks.\n\n\u201cIs it just you who\u2019s stationed up here, or \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.\u201d\n\n\u201cDawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nThey trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his Cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes. Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful. Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadn\u2019t been her fault at all, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. He was far from blaming her for Sirius\u2019s death; it was no more her fault than anyone else\u2019s (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence, Tonks\u2019s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them.\n\nHaving always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station. With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry, and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind. But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them chained shut.\n\n\u201cAlohomora!\u201d he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t work on these,\u201d said Tonks. \u201cDumbledore bewitched them himself.\u201d\n\nHarry looked around.\n\n\u201cI could climb a wall,\u201d he suggested.\n\n\u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Tonks flatly. \u201cAnti-intruder jinxes on all of them. Security\u2019s been tightened a hundredfold this summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then,\u201d said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness, \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming down for you,\u201d said Tonks. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\nA lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch\u2019s wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them, and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open. \u201cNice of you to turn up, Potter, although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t change, I didn\u2019t have my \u2014\u201d Harry began, but Snape cut across him.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite \u2014 ah \u2014 safe in my hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI meant Hagrid to get the message,\u201d said Tonks, frowning.\n\n\u201cHagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here, so I took it instead. And incidentally,\u201d said Snape, standing back to allow Harry to pass him, \u201cI was interested to see your new Patronus.\u201d\n\nHe shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again, so that they slithered, clinking, back into place.\n\n\u201cI think you were better off with the old one,\u201d said Snape, the malice in his voice unmistakable. \u201cThe new one looks weak.\u201d\n\nAs Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, fleetingly, a look of shock and anger on Tonks\u2019s face. Then she was covered in darkness once more.\n\n\u201cGood night,\u201d Harry called to her over his shoulder, as he began the walk up to the school with Snape. \u201cThanks for . . . everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you, Harry.\u201d\n\nSnape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that Snape could not feel them burning him. He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry\u2019s forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape\u2019s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.\n\n\u201cFifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,\u201d said Snape. \u201cAnd, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know, I don\u2019t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term: We haven\u2019t even started pudding. You might have set a record, Potter.\u201d\n\nThe fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late.\n\n\u201cI suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?\u201d Snape continued. \u201cAnd with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect.\u201d\n\nStill Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might explode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening.\n\nThey reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hall. Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being noticed. As though he had read Harry\u2019s mind, however, Snape said, \u201cNo Cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is what you wanted, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nHarry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors: anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall, with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room, was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a shimmering blur to Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, and forced his way in between them.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you \u2014 blimey, what\u2019ve you done to your face?\u201d said Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity.\n\n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d said Harry, grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re covered in blood!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cCome here \u2014\u201d\n\nShe raised her wand, said \u201cTergeo!\u201d and siphoned off the dried blood.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, feeling his now clean face. \u201cHow\u2019s my nose looking?\u201d\n\n\u201cNormal,\u201d said Hermione anxiously. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it? Harry, what happened? We\u2019ve been terrified!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cNot now, Hermione,\u201d said Harry, in a darkly significant voice. He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as far and wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldn\u2019t reach too many Gryffindor ears.\n\nHe reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be replaced with puddings.\n\n\u201cYou missed the Sorting, anyway,\u201d said Hermione, as Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau.\n\n\u201cHat say anything interesting?\u201d asked Harry, taking a piece of treacle tart.\n\n\u201cMore of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast, doesn\u2019t he? It can\u2019t be long now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape said Hagrid was late for the feast \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen Snape? How come?\u201d said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau.\n\n\u201cBumped into him,\u201d said Harry evasively.\n\n\u201cHagrid was only a few minutes late,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cLook, he\u2019s waving at you, Harry.\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid\u2019s elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid\u2019s other side; she rarely left her tower room, and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before. She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having always considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry\u2019s parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge had made him even less eager to find himself in her company, but thankfully, this year he would be dropping Divination. Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would not give to fight Malfoy one-on-one . . .\n\n\u201cSo what did Professor Slughorn want?\u201d Hermione asked.\n\n\u201cTo know what really happened at the Ministry,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHim and everyone else here,\u201d sniffed Hermione. \u201cPeople were interrogating us about it on the train, weren\u2019t they, Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAll wanting to know if you really are \u2018the Chosen One\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts,\u201d interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff. \u201cI am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information, however. \u2018Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,\u2019 I told them. \u2018I would rather die than betray his trust.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not saying much, seeing as you\u2019re already dead,\u201d Ron observed.\n\n\u201cOnce again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.\n\n\u201cThe very best of evenings to you!\u201d he said, smiling broadly, his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to his hand?\u201d gasped Hermione.\n\nShe was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledore\u2019s right hand was as blackened and dead-looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers swept the room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, merely smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury.\n\n\u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d he said airily. \u201cNow . . . to our new students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back! Another year full of magical education awaits you . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHis hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,\u201d Harry whispered to Hermione. \u201cI thought he\u2019d have cured it by now, though . . . or Madam Pomfrey would\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks as if it\u2019s died,\u201d said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. \u201cBut there are some injuries you can\u2019t cure . . . old curses . . . and there are poisons without antidotes. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes.\n\n\u201cThose wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year. Professor Slughorn\u201d \u2014 Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming in the candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow \u2014 \u201cis a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.\u201d\n\n\u201cPotions?\u201d\n\n\u201cPotions?\u201d\n\nThe word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether they had heard right.\n\n\u201cPotions?\u201d said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at Harry. \u201cBut you said \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, meanwhile,\u201d said Dumbledore, raising his voice so that it carried over all the muttering, \u201cwill be taking over the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direction. He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed. How could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time? Hadn\u2019t it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?\n\n\u201cBut Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cI thought he was!\u201d said Harry, racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching.\n\nSnape, who was sitting on Dumbledore\u2019s right, did not stand up at the mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much.\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s one good thing,\u201d he said savagely. \u201cSnape\u2019ll be gone by the end of the year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cThat job\u2019s jinxed. No one\u2019s lasted more than a year. . . . Quirrell actually died doing it. . . . Personally, I\u2019m going to keep my fingers crossed for another death. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d said Hermione, shocked and reproachful.\n\n\u201cHe might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year,\u201d said Ron reasonably. \u201cThat Slughorn bloke might not want to stay long-term. Moody didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his heart\u2019s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing.\n\n\u201cNow, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.\u201d\n\nThe silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke. Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore, but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he found the headmaster\u2019s words unworthy of his attention.\n\n\u201cI cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe. The castle\u2019s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff. I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose upon you, however irksome you might find them \u2014 in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with the utmost regard for your own and others\u2019 safety.\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more.\n\n\u201cBut now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-rested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say good night. Pip pip!\u201d\n\nWith the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches were moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the Great Hall toward their dormitories. Harry, who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, lagged behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw ahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefect\u2019s duty of shepherding the first years, but Ron remained with Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat really happened to your nose?\u201d he asked, once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall, and out of earshot of anyone else.\n\nHarry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh.\n\n\u201cI saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,\u201d he said darkly.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, never mind that,\u201d said Harry bitterly. \u201cListen to what he was saying before he found out I was there. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoy\u2019s boasts. With what Harry considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was unimpressed.\n\n\u201cCome on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinson. . . . What kind of mission would You-Know-Who have given him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know Voldemort doesn\u2019t need someone at Hogwarts? It wouldn\u2019t be the first \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish yeh\u2019d stop sayin\u2019 tha\u2019 name, Harry,\u201d said a reproachful voice behind them. Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagrid shaking his head.\n\n\u201cDumbledore uses that name,\u201d said Harry stubbornly.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, tha\u2019s Dumbledore, innit?\u201d said Hagrid mysteriously. \u201cSo how come yeh were late, Harry? I was worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot held up on the train,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy were you late?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was with Grawp,\u201d said Hagrid happily. \u201cLos\u2019 track o\u2019 the time. He\u2019s got a new home up in the mountains now, Dumbledore fixed it \u2014 nice big cave. He\u2019s much happier than he was in the forest. We were havin\u2019 a good chat.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron\u2019s eye; the last time he had met Hagrid\u2019s half-brother, a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots, his vocabulary had comprised five words, two of which he was unable to pronounce properly.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s really come on,\u201d said Hagrid proudly. \u201cYeh\u2019ll be amazed. I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 o\u2019 trainin\u2019 him up as me assistant.\u201d\n\nRon snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze. They were now standing beside the oak front doors.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll see yeh tomorrow, firs\u2019 lesson\u2019s straight after lunch. Come early an\u2019 yeh can say hello ter Buck \u2014 I mean, Witherwings!\u201d\n\nRaising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the front doors into the darkness.\n\nHarry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell that Ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are you?\u201d\n\nRon shook his head. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not either, are you?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head too.\n\n\u201cAnd Hermione,\u201d said Ron, \u201cshe\u2019s not, is she?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject, he did not like to think."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter9": "THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE\n\n\n\n\nHarry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support for his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express.\n\n\u201cBut he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d interjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said uncertainly, \u201cI don\u2019t know. . . . It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is . . . but that\u2019s a big lie to tell. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Harry, but he could not press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rude to point,\u201d Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered.\n\n\u201cI love being a sixth year. And we\u2019re going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need that time for studying, Ron!\u201d said Hermione, as they set off down the corridor.\n\n\u201cYeah, but not today,\u201d said Ron. \u201cToday\u2019s going to be a real doss, I reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold it!\u201d said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. \u201cFanged Frisbees are banned, hand it over,\u201d she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione\u2019s grip.\n\n\u201cExcellent, I\u2019ve always wanted one of these.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Lavender Brown had apparently found Ron\u2019s remark highly amusing. She continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.\n\nThe ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embarrassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening.\n\n\u201cBut he can\u2019t really think we\u2019d continue Care of Magical Creatures!\u201d she said, looking distressed. \u201cI mean, when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, though, innit?\u201d said Ron, swallowing an entire fried egg whole. \u201cWe were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject. D\u2019you reckon anyone\u2019s going to go on to N.E.W.T.?\u201d\n\nNeither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid\u2019s eye and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later.\n\nAfter they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall\u2019s descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.\n\nHermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first-period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a little longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his O.W.L. results.\n\n\u201cHerbology, fine,\u201d she said. \u201cProfessor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an \u2018Outstanding\u2019 O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with \u2018Exceeds Expectations.\u2019 But the problem is Transfiguration. I\u2019m sorry, Longbottom, but an \u2018Acceptable\u2019 really isn\u2019t good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level. I just don\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to cope with the coursework.\u201d\n\nNeville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles.\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway? I\u2019ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nNeville looked miserable and muttered something about \u201cmy grandmother wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmph,\u201d snorted Professor McGonagall. \u201cIt\u2019s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she\u2019s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have \u2014 particularly after what happened at the Ministry.\u201d\n\nNeville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an \u2018Exceeds Expectations\u2019 in Charms, however \u2014 why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,\u201d mumbled Neville.\n\n\u201cTake Charms,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, \u201cand I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.\u201d Smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville\u2019s face, Professor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville.\n\nProfessor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still teaching Divination.\n\n\u201cHe and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of Divination. \u201cThe sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.\u201d\n\nParvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen.\n\n\u201cSo, Potter, Potter . . .\u201d said Professor McGonagall, consulting her notes as she turned to Harry. \u201cCharms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration . . . all fine. I must say, I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now, why haven\u2019t you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was, but you told me I had to get an \u2018Outstanding\u2019 in my O.W.L., Professor.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject. Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with \u2018Exceeds Expectations\u2019 at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t buy the books or any ingredients or anything \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cVery well, Potter, here is your schedule. Oh, by the way \u2014 twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry, and the two of them left the table together.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Ron delightedly, gazing at his schedule, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a free period now . . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent!\u201d\n\nThey returned to the common room, which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year.\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d get that, well done,\u201d she called over, pointing at the Captain\u2019s badge on Harry\u2019s chest. \u201cTell me when you call trials!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Harry, \u201cyou don\u2019t need to try out, I\u2019ve watched you play for five years. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t start off like that,\u201d she said warningly. \u201cFor all you know, there\u2019s someone much better than me out there. Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces, or letting in their friends. . . .\u201d\n\nRon looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year student. It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks\u2019s yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close.\n\nAn hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below. Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of heavy books and looking put-upon.\n\n\u201cWe got so much homework for Runes,\u201d she said anxiously, when Harry and Ron joined her. \u201cA fifteen-inch essay, two translations, and I\u2019ve got to read these by Wednesday!\u201d\n\n\u201cShame,\u201d yawned Ron.\n\n\u201cYou wait,\u201d she said resentfully. \u201cI bet Snape gives us loads.\u201d\n\nThe classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.\n\n\u201cInside,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candlelight. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.\n\n\u201cI have not asked you to take out your books,\u201d said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. \u201cI wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.\u201d\n\nHis black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry\u2019s than anyone else\u2019s.\n\n\u201cYou have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.\u201d\n\nYou believe . . . like you haven\u2019t watched them all come and go, Snape, hoping you\u2019d be next, thought Harry scathingly.\n\n\u201cNaturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will be much more advanced.\u201d\n\nSnape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view.\n\n\u201cThe Dark Arts,\u201d said Snape, \u201care many, varied, ever-changing, and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?\n\n\u201cYour defenses,\u201d said Snape, a little louder, \u201cmust therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures\u201d \u2014 he indicated a few of them as he swept past \u2014 \u201cgive a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the Cruciatus Curse\u201d \u2014 he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony \u2014 \u201cfeel the Dementor\u2019s Kiss\u201d \u2014 a wizard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall \u2014 \u201cor provoke the aggression of the Inferius\u201d \u2014 a bloody mass upon the ground.\n\n\u201cHas an Inferius been seen, then?\u201d said Parvati Patil in a high-pitched voice. \u201cIs it definite, is he using them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,\u201d said Snape, \u201cwhich means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them again. Now . . .\u201d\n\nHe set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes billowing behind him.\n\n\u201c. . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before saying curtly, \u201cVery well \u2014 Miss Granger?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you\u2019re about to perform,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cwhich gives you a split-second advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Six,\u201d said Snape dismissively (over in the corner, Malfoy sniggered), \u201cbut correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some\u201d \u2014 his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more \u2014 \u201clack.\u201d\n\nHarry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away.\n\n\u201cYou will now divide,\u201d Snape went on, \u201cinto pairs. One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.\u201d\n\nAlthough Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville\u2019s muttered Jelly-Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task.\n\nRon, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.\n\n\u201cPathetic, Weasley,\u201d said Snape, after a while. \u201cHere \u2014 let me show you \u2014\u201d\n\nHe turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, \u201cProtego!\u201d\n\nHis Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself, scowling.\n\n\u201cDo you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry stiffly.\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to call me \u2018sir,\u2019 Professor.\u201d\n\nThe words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying. Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, however, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively.\n\n\u201cDetention, Saturday night, my office,\u201d said Snape. \u201cI do not take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even \u2018the Chosen One.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was brilliant, Harry!\u201d chortled Ron, once they were safely on their way to break a short while later.\n\n\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have said it,\u201d said Hermione, frowning at Ron. \u201cWhat made you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tried to jinx me, in case you didn\u2019t notice!\u201d fumed Harry. \u201cI had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn\u2019t he use another guinea pig for a change? What\u2019s Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructible stuff \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cI thought he sounded a bit like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, when you were telling us what it\u2019s like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn\u2019t just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts \u2014 well, wasn\u2019t that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?\u201d\n\nHarry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue.\n\n\u201cHarry! Hey, Harry!\u201d\n\nHarry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last year\u2019s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment.\n\n\u201cFor you,\u201d panted Sloper. \u201cListen, I heard you\u2019re the new Captain. When\u2019re you holding trials?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right. I was hoping it\u2019d be this weekend \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin, slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence, he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment as he went.\n\nDear Harry,\n\nI would like to start our private lessons this Saturday. Kindly come along to my office at 8 p.m. I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAlbus Dumbledore\n\nP.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe enjoys Acid Pops?\u201d said Ron, who had read the message over Harry\u2019s shoulder and was looking perplexed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,\u201d said Harry in a low voice. \u201cHa! Snape\u2019s not going to be pleased. . . . I won\u2019t be able to do his detention!\u201d\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room, where they grudgingly started Snape\u2019s homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon\u2019s double Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long, been Snape\u2019s.\n\nWhen they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Ravenclaws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry approached, \u201cdidn\u2019t get a chance to speak in Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you, Ron \u2014 Hermione?\u201d\n\nBefore they could say more than \u201cfine,\u201d the dungeon door opened and Slughorn\u2019s belly preceded him out of the door. As they filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm.\n\nThe dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle, and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion\u2019s fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink. A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who grinned back lazily.\n\n\u201cNow then, now then, now then,\u201d said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. \u201cScales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don\u2019t forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d said Harry, raising his hand.\n\n\u201cHarry, m\u2019boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got a book or scales or anything \u2014 nor\u2019s Ron \u2014 we didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I\u2019m sure we can lend you some scales, and we\u2019ve got a small stock of old books here, they\u2019ll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .\u201d\n\nSlughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment\u2019s foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.\n\n\u201cNow then,\u201d said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, \u201cI\u2019ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of \u2019em, even if you haven\u2019t made \u2019em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?\u201d\n\nHe indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it.\n\nHermione\u2019s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else\u2019s; Slughorn pointed at her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cVery good, very good!\u201d said Slughorn happily. \u201cNow,\u201d he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, \u201cthis one here is pretty well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s hand was fastest once more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Polyjuice Potion, sir,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year.\n\n\u201cExcellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?\u201d said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione\u2019s hand punched the air again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Amortentia!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,\u201d said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, \u201cbut I assume you know what it does?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most powerful love potion in the world!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cQuite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the steam rising in characteristic spirals,\u201d said Hermione enthusiastically, \u201cand it\u2019s supposed to smell differently to each of us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and \u2014\u201d\n\nBut she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.\n\n\u201cMay I ask your name, my dear?\u201d said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione\u2019s embarrassment.\n\n\u201cHermione Granger, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cGranger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so, sir. I\u2019m Muggle-born, you see.\u201d\n\nHarry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her.\n\n\u201cOho! \u2018One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she\u2019s the best in our year!\u2019 I\u2019m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,\u201d said Slughorn genially.\n\nMalfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered, \u201cDid you really tell him I\u2019m the best in the year? Oh, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s so impressive about that?\u201d whispered Ron, who for some reason looked annoyed. \u201cYou are the best in the year \u2014 I\u2019d\u2019ve told him so if he\u2019d asked me!\u201d\n\nHermione smiled but made a \u201cshhing\u201d gesture, so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.\n\n\u201cAmortentia doesn\u2019t really create love, of course. It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room \u2014 oh yes,\u201d he said, nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically. \u201cWhen you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love. . . .\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Slughorn, \u201cit is time for us to start work.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, you haven\u2019t told us what\u2019s in this one,\u201d said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn\u2019s desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.\n\n\u201cOho,\u201d said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect. \u201cYes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,\u201d he turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp, \u201cthat you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s liquid luck,\u201d said Hermione excitedly. \u201cIt makes you lucky!\u201d\n\nThe whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter. Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head, because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention.\n\n\u201cQuite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it\u2019s a funny little potion, Felix Felicis,\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cDesperately tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed . . . at least until the effects wear off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t people drink it all the time, sir?\u201d said Terry Boot eagerly.\n\n\u201cBecause if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cToo much of a good thing, you know . . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken sparingly, and very occasionally . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever taken it, sir?\u201d asked Michael Corner with great interest.\n\n\u201cTwice in my life,\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cOnce when I was twenty-four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast. Two perfect days.\u201d\n\nHe gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting or not, thought Harry, the effect was good.\n\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, \u201cis what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.\u201d\n\nThere was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.\n\n\u201cOne tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,\u201d said Slughorn, taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all. \u201cEnough for twelve hours\u2019 luck. From dawn till dusk, you will be lucky in everything you attempt.\n\n\u201cNow, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance, examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary!\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, \u201chow are you to win my fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion-Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here. Off you go!\u201d\n\nThere was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.\n\nTo his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could.\n\nEveryone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions, that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the \u201csmooth, black currant\u2013colored liquid\u201d mentioned as the ideal halfway stage.\n\nHaving finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction:\n\nCrush with flat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting.\n\n\n\n\u201cSir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?\u201d\n\nHarry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, \u201cI was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn\u2019t unexpected, dragon pox at his age. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirking. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis.\n\nThe sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up. Harry turned to Hermione.\n\n\u201cCan I borrow your silver knife?\u201d\n\nShe nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion, which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now.\n\nHarry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his astonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.\n\nHis annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot, Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According to the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner had made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?\n\nHarry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned palest pink.\n\n\u201cHow are you doing that?\u201d demanded Hermione, who was red-faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.\n\n\u201cAdd a clockwise stir \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, the book says counterclockwise!\u201d she snapped.\n\nHarry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counterclockwise, one stir clockwise . . .\n\nAcross the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as he could see, no one else\u2019s potion had turned as pale as his. He felt elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon.\n\n\u201cAnd time\u2019s . . . up!\u201d called Slughorn. \u201cStop stirring, please!\u201d\n\nSlughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into cauldrons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Ron\u2019s cauldron. He passed over Ernie\u2019s navy concoction. Hermione\u2019s potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw Harry\u2019s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face.\n\n\u201cThe clear winner!\u201d he cried to the dungeon. \u201cExcellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve inherited your mother\u2019s talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are \u2014 one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!\u201d\n\nHarry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins\u2019 faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermione\u2019s. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.\n\n\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d he whispered to Harry as they left the dungeon.\n\n\u201cGot lucky, I suppose,\u201d said Harry, because Malfoy was within earshot.\n\nOnce they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione\u2019s face became stonier with every word he uttered.\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose you think I cheated?\u201d he finished, aggravated by her expression.\n\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t exactly your own work, was it?\u201d she said stiffly.\n\n\u201cHe only followed different instructions to ours,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCould\u2019ve been a catastrophe, couldn\u2019t it? But he took a risk and it paid off.\u201d He heaved a sigh. \u201cSlughorn could\u2019ve handed me that book, but no, I get the one no one\u2019s ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fifty-two, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said a voice close by Harry\u2019s left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn\u2019s dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. \u201cDid I hear right? You\u2019ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?\u201d\n\nShe looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, you know, Riddle\u2019s diary. It\u2019s just an old textbook someone\u2019s scribbled on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re doing what it says?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there\u2019s nothing funny \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGinny\u2019s got a point,\u201d said Hermione, perking up at once. \u201cWe ought to check that there\u2019s nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand.\n\n\u201cSpecialis Revelio!\u201d she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover.\n\nNothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared.\n\n\u201cFinished?\u201d said Harry irritably. \u201cOr d\u2019you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems all right,\u201d said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. \u201cI mean, it really does seem to be . . . just a textbook.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Then I\u2019ll have it back,\u201d said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor.\n\nNobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.\n\nThis Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter10": "THE HOUSE OF GAUNT\n\n\n\n\nFor the rest of the week\u2019s Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince\u2019s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borage\u2019s, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about Harry\u2019s abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on with what she called the \u201cofficial\u201d instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince\u2019s.\n\nHarry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.\n\n\u201cOr herself,\u201d said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. \u201cIt might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl\u2019s than a boy\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Half-Blood Prince, he was called,\u201d Harry said. \u201cHow many girls have been Princes?\u201d\n\nHermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down.\n\nHarry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s five to eight, I\u2019d better go, I\u2019ll be late for Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cOoooh!\u201d gasped Hermione, looking up at once. \u201cGood luck! We\u2019ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!\u201d\n\n\u201cHope it goes okay,\u201d said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole.\n\nHarry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked.\n\n\u201cTwo of spades: conflict,\u201d she murmured, as she passed the place where Harry crouched, hidden. \u201cSeven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who dislikes the questioner \u2014\u201d\n\nShe stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry\u2019s statue.\n\n\u201cWell, that can\u2019t be right,\u201d she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall.\n\n\u201cAcid Pops,\u201d said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumbledore\u2019s office.\n\nHarry knocked.\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d said Dumbledore\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cGood evening, sir,\u201d said Harry, walking into the headmaster\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cAh, good evening, Harry. Sit down,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve had an enjoyable first week back at school?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, thanks, sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!\u201d\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too stern.\n\n\u201cI have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snape\u2019s detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore\u2019s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.\n\n\u201cSo, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. \u201cYou have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you during these \u2014 for want of a better word \u2014 lessons?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\u201cYou said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me everything,\u201d said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice. \u201cSir,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAnd so I did,\u201d said Dumbledore placidly. \u201cI told you everything I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in, Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you think you\u2019re right?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNaturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being \u2014 forgive me \u2014 rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Harry tentatively, \u201cdoes what you\u2019re going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . . survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,\u201d said Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next day\u2019s weather, \u201cand I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.\u201d\n\nDumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straightened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry.\n\n\u201cYou look worried.\u201d\n\nHarry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive, had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But Dumbledore was smiling.\n\n\u201cThis time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more unusually, with permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are we going, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a trip down Bob Ogden\u2019s memory lane,\u201d said Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery-white substance.\n\n\u201cWho was Bob Ogden?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe died some time ago, but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry . . .\u201d\n\nBut Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful.\n\n\u201cShall \u2014 shall I, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter, Harry \u2014\u201d\n\nDumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out.\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 how did you injure your hand?\u201d Harry asked again, looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity.\n\n\u201cNow is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have an appointment with Bob Ogden.\u201d\n\nDumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas.\n\n\u201cAfter you,\u201d said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl.\n\nHarry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite suddenly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him.\n\nThey were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance, however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane.\n\nDumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the way they had come read: GREAT HANGLETON, 5 MILES. The arm pointing after Ogden said LITTLE HANGLETON, 1 MILE.\n\nThey walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows, the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a village, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.\n\nOgden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final destination and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Ogden\u2019s frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge.\n\nDumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping downhill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand.\n\nDespite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry\u2019s eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking.\n\nOgden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had nailed a dead snake.\n\nThen there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden, who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not welcome.\u201d\n\nThe man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing. His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frightening, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 good morning. I\u2019m from the Ministry of Magic \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not welcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 I don\u2019t understand you,\u201d said Ogden nervously.\n\nHarry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger was making himself very clear in Harry\u2019s opinion, particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other.\n\n\u201cYou understand him, I\u2019m sure, Harry?\u201d said Dumbledore quietly.\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Harry, slightly nonplussed. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Ogden \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he suddenly understood.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s speaking Parseltongue?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling.\n\nThe man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one hand, wand in the other.\n\n\u201cNow, look \u2014\u201d Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang, and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers.\n\n\u201cMorfin!\u201d said a loud voice.\n\nAn elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically. This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground.\n\n\u201cMinistry, is it?\u201d said the older man, looking down at Ogden.\n\n\u201cCorrect!\u201d said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. \u201cAnd you, I take it, are Mr. Gaunt?\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u2019right,\u201d said Gaunt. \u201cGot you in the face, did he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he did!\u201d snapped Ogden.\n\n\u201cShould\u2019ve made your presence known, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d said Gaunt aggressively. \u201cThis is private property. Can\u2019t just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefend himself against what, man?\u201d said Ogden, clambering back to his feet.\n\n\u201cBusybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.\u201d\n\nOgden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin.\n\n\u201cGet in the house. Don\u2019t argue.\u201d\n\nThis time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your son I\u2019m here to see, Mr. Gaunt,\u201d said Ogden, as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. \u201cThat was Morfin, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAr, that was Morfin,\u201d said the old man indifferently. \u201cAre you pure-blood?\u201d he asked, suddenly aggressive.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s neither here nor there,\u201d said Ogden coldly, and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather differently. He squinted into Ogden\u2019s face and muttered, in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, \u201cNow I come to think about it, I\u2019ve seen noses like yours down in the village.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it, if your son\u2019s been let loose on them,\u201d said Ogden. \u201cPerhaps we could continue this discussion inside?\u201d\n\n\u201cInside?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Gaunt. I\u2019ve already told you. I\u2019m here about Morfin. We sent an owl \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no use for owls,\u201d said Gaunt. \u201cI don\u2019t open letters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors,\u201d said Ogden tartly. \u201cI am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this morning \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, all right!\u201d bellowed Gaunt. \u201cCome in the bleeding house, then, and much good it\u2019ll do you!\u201d\n\nThe house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room combined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue:\n\nHissy, hissy, little snakey,\n\nSlither on the floor,\n\nYou be good to Morfin\n\nOr he\u2019ll nail you to the door.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room, a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother\u2019s, stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-looking person.\n\n\u201cM\u2019daughter, Merope,\u201d said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said Ogden.\n\nShe did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her.\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Gaunt,\u201d said Ogden, \u201cto get straight to the point, we have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night.\u201d\n\nThere was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the pots.\n\n\u201cPick it up!\u201d Gaunt bellowed at her. \u201cThat\u2019s it, grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle, what\u2019s your wand for, you useless sack of muck?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Gaunt, please!\u201d said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in two.\n\nMorfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed, \u201cMend it, you pointless lump, mend it!\u201d\n\nMerope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, \u201cReparo.\u201d The pot mended itself instantly.\n\nGaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his daughter, \u201cLucky the nice man from the Ministry\u2019s here, isn\u2019t it? Perhaps he\u2019ll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn\u2019t mind dirty Squibs. . . .\u201d\n\nWithout looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish.\n\n\u201cMr. Gaunt,\u201d Ogden began again, \u201cas I\u2019ve said: the reason for my visit \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard you the first time!\u201d snapped Gaunt. \u201cAnd so what? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him \u2014 what about it, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cMorfin has broken Wizarding law,\u201d said Ogden sternly.\n\n\u201c\u2018Morfin has broken Wizarding law.\u2019\u201d Gaunt imitated Ogden\u2019s voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again. \u201cHe taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that\u2019s illegal now, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Ogden. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it is.\u201d\n\nHe pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, then, his sentence?\u201d said Gaunt, his voice rising angrily.\n\n\u201cIt is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSummons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning my son anywhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,\u201d said Ogden.\n\n\u201cAnd you think we\u2019re scum, do you?\u201d screamed Gaunt, advancing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his chest. \u201cScum who\u2019ll come running when the Ministry tells \u2019em to? Do you know who you\u2019re talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,\u201d said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden\u2019s eyes. \u201cSee this? See this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it\u2019s been in our family, that\u2019s how far back we go, and pure-blood all the way! Know how much I\u2019ve been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really no idea,\u201d said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose, \u201cand it\u2019s quite beside the point, Mr. Gaunt. Your son has committed \u2014\u201d\n\nWith a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck.\n\n\u201cSee this?\u201d he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath.\n\n\u201cI see it, I see it!\u201d said Ogden hastily.\n\n\u201cSlytherin\u2019s!\u201d yelled Gaunt. \u201cSalazar Slytherin\u2019s! We\u2019re his last living descendants, what do you say to that, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Gaunt, your daughter!\u201d said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air.\n\n\u201cSo!\u201d said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute. \u201cDon\u2019t you go talking to us as if we\u2019re dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods, wizards all \u2014 more than you can say, I don\u2019t doubt!\u201d\n\nAnd he spat on the floor at Ogden\u2019s feet. Morfin cackled again. Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair, said nothing.\n\n\u201cMr. Gaunt,\u201d said Ogden doggedly, \u201cI am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night. Our information\u201d \u2014 he glanced down at his scroll of parchment \u2014 \u201cis that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.\u201d\n\nMorfin giggled.\n\n\u201cBe quiet, boy,\u201d snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell silent again.\n\n\u201cAnd so what if he did, then?\u201d Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden. \u201cI expect you\u2019ve wiped the Muggle\u2019s filthy face clean for him, and his memory to boot \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?\u201d said Ogden. \u201cThis was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAr, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw you,\u201d sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again.\n\n\u201cThis discussion is getting us nowhere,\u201d said Ogden firmly. \u201cIt is clear from your son\u2019s attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions.\u201d He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. \u201cMorfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg \u2014\u201d\n\nOgden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window. Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide. Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expression hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was starkly white.\n\n\u201cMy God, what an eyesore!\u201d rang out a girl\u2019s voice, as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them. \u201cCouldn\u2019t your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ours,\u201d said a young man\u2019s voice. \u201cEverything on the other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The son\u2019s quite mad, you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village \u2014\u201d\n\nThe girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair.\n\n\u201cKeep your seat,\u201d said his father warningly, in Parseltongue.\n\n\u201cTom,\u201d said the girl\u2019s voice again, now so close they were clearly right beside the house, \u201cI might be wrong \u2014 but has somebody nailed a snake to that door?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood lord, you\u2019re right!\u201d said the man\u2019s voice. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the son, I told you he\u2019s not right in the head. Don\u2019t look at it, Cecilia, darling.\u201d\n\nThe jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter again.\n\n\u201c\u2018Darling,\u2019\u201d whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his sister. \u201c\u2018Darling,\u2019 he called her. So he wouldn\u2019t have you anyway.\u201d\n\nMerope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking from his son to his daughter. \u201cWhat did you say, Morfin?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe likes looking at that Muggle,\u201d said Morfin, a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified. \u201cAlways in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at him, isn\u2019t she? And last night \u2014\u201d\n\nMerope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on ruthlessly, \u201cHanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cHanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?\u201d said Gaunt quietly.\n\nAll three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping.\n\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl. \u201cMy daughter \u2014 pure-blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin \u2014 hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?\u201d\n\nMerope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall, apparently unable to speak.\n\n\u201cBut I got him, Father!\u201d cackled Morfin. \u201cI got him as he went by and he didn\u2019t look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!\u201d roared Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughter\u2019s throat.\n\nBoth Harry and Ogden yelled \u201cNo!\u201d at the same time; Ogden raised his wand and cried, \u201cRelashio!\u201d Gaunt was thrown backward, away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand.\n\nOgden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope\u2019s screams echoing in his ears.\n\nOgden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse\u2019s flank and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in dust, running pell-mell up the lane.\n\n\u201cI think that will do, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. He took Harry by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet, back in Dumbledore\u2019s now twilit office.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the girl in the cottage?\u201d said Harry at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. \u201cMerope, or whatever her name was?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, she survived,\u201d said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. \u201cOgden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarvolo?\u201d Harry repeated wonderingly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. \u201cI am glad to see you\u2019re keeping up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat old man was \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort\u2019s grandfather, yes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cMarvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Merope,\u201d said Harry, leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore, \u201cso Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemort\u2019s mother?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort\u2019s father. I wonder whether you noticed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good indeed,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming. \u201cYes, that was Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret, burning passion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they ended up married?\u201d Harry said in disbelief, unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love.\n\n\u201cI think you are forgetting,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cthat Merope was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father. Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years.\n\n\u201cCan you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love with her instead?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Imperius Curse?\u201d Harry suggested. \u201cOr a love potion?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her, and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day, when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire\u2019s son ran off with the tramp\u2019s daughter, Merope.\n\n\u201cBut the villagers\u2019 shock was nothing to Marvolo\u2019s. He returned from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done.\n\n\u201cFrom all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death \u2014 or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Merope? She . . . she died, didn\u2019t she? Wasn\u2019t Voldemort brought up in an orphanage?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe must do a certain amount of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being \u2018hoodwinked\u2019 and \u2018taken in.\u2019 What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she did have his baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cWhy did the love potion stop working?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, this is guesswork,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cbut I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby\u2019s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son.\u201d\n\nThe sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore\u2019s office seemed to glow more brightly than before.\n\n\u201cI think that will do for tonight, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore after a moment or two.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe got to his feet, but did not leave.\n\n\u201cSir . . . is it important to know all this about Voldemort\u2019s past?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery important, I think,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cAnd it . . . it\u2019s got something to do with the prophecy?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has everything to do with the prophecy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same.\n\nHe turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he turned back again. \u201cSir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you\u2019ve told me?\u201d\n\nDumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, \u201cYes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort\u2019s secrets.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s just Ron and Hermione. Good night.\u201d\n\nHe turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set with a large, cracked, black stone.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Harry, staring at it. \u201cThat ring \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYou were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I was,\u201d Dumbledore agreed.\n\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t it . . . sir, isn\u2019t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden?\u201d\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. \u201cThe very same.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how come \u2014 ? Have you always had it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I acquired it very recently,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cA few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle\u2019s, in fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cAround that time, yes, Harry.\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling.\n\n\u201cSir, how exactly \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good night.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood night, sir.\u201d"}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter11": "HERMIONE\u2019S HELPING HAND\n\n\n\n\nAs Hermione had predicted, the sixth years\u2019 free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione\u2019s increasing resentment, Harry\u2019s best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the Half-Blood Prince.\n\nNonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too. Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology, but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.\n\nOne result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and explain,\u201d said Hermione, looking up at Hagrid\u2019s huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd we\u2019re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t hate it!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cSpeak for yourself, I haven\u2019t forgotten the skrewts,\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you now, we\u2019ve had a narrow escape. You didn\u2019t hear him going on about his gormless brother \u2014 we\u2019d have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we\u2019d stayed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate not talking to Hagrid,\u201d said Hermione, looking upset.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go down after Quidditch,\u201d Harry assured her. He too was missing Hagrid, although like Ron he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives. \u201cBut trials might take all morning, the number of people who have applied.\u201d He felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. \u201cI dunno why the team\u2019s this popular all of a sudden.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, suddenly impatient. \u201cIt\u2019s not Quidditch that\u2019s popular, it\u2019s you! You\u2019ve never been more interesting, and frankly, you\u2019ve never been more fanciable.\u201d\n\nRon gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to Harry.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows you\u2019ve been telling the truth now, don\u2019t they? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they\u2019re calling you \u2018the Chosen One\u2019 \u2014 well, come on, can\u2019t you see why people are fascinated by you?\u201d\n\nHarry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look,\u201d said Ron, shaking back his sleeves.\n\n\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t hurt that you\u2019ve grown about a foot over the summer either,\u201d Hermione finished, ignoring Ron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tall,\u201d said Ron inconsequentially.\n\nThe post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked windows, scattering everyone with droplets of water. Most people were receiving more post than usual; anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them, in turn, that all was well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term; his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been disappointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later, an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon.\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts.\n\n\u201cOh good,\u201d said Hermione, delighted. \u201cNow you can give that graffitied copy back.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you mad?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019m keeping it! Look, I\u2019ve thought it out \u2014\u201d\n\nHe pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, \u201cDiffindo!\u201d The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book (Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers, tapped each, and said, \u201cReparo!\u201d\n\nThere sat the Prince\u2019s copy, disguised as a new book, and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give Slughorn back the new one, he can\u2019t complain, it cost nine Galleons.\u201d\n\nHermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disapproving, but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that day\u2019s copy of the Daily Prophet. She unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page.\n\n\u201cAnyone we know dead?\u201d asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice; he posed the same question every time Hermione opened her paper.\n\n\u201cNo, but there have been more dementor attacks,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd an arrest.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent, who?\u201d said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\n\u201cStan Shunpike,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, startled.\n\n\u201c\u2018Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus, has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home . . .\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cStan Shunpike, a Death Eater?\u201d said Harry, remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before. \u201cNo way!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe might have been put under the Imperius Curse,\u201d said Ron reasonably. \u201cYou never can tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it,\u201d said Hermione, who was still reading. \u201cIt says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters\u2019 secret plans in a pub.\u201d She looked up with a troubled expression on her face. \u201cIf he was under the Imperius Curse, he\u2019d hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIsn\u2019t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI dunno what they\u2019re playing at, taking Stan seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey probably want to look as though they\u2019re doing something,\u201d said Hermione, frowning. \u201cPeople are terrified \u2014 you know the Patil twins\u2019 parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d said Ron, goggling at Hermione. \u201cBut Hogwarts is safer than their homes, bound to be! We\u2019ve got Aurors, and all those extra protective spells, and we\u2019ve got Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got him all the time,\u201d said Hermione very quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet. \u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed? His seat\u2019s been empty as often as Hagrid\u2019s this past week.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster\u2019s chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s left the school to do something with the Order,\u201d said Hermione in a low voice. \u201cI mean . . . it\u2019s all looking serious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since.\n\nWhen they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins\u2019 parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became something more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harry\u2019s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle, and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck.\n\nAs Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning. Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express.\n\n\u201cWe met on the train, in old Sluggy\u2019s compartment,\u201d he said confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harry\u2019s hand. \u201cCormac McLaggen, Keeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t try out last year, did you?\u201d asked Harry, taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving.\n\n\u201cI was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,\u201d said McLaggen, with something of a swagger. \u201cAte a pound of doxy eggs for a bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell . . . if you wait over there . . .\u201d\n\nHe pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermione was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggen\u2019s face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both \u201cold Sluggy\u2019s\u201d favorites.\n\nHarry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch. This was a good decision: The first ten was made up of first years and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goalposts.\n\nThe second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else.\n\nThe third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group were Hufflepuffs.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone else here who\u2019s not from Gryffindor,\u201d roared Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, \u201cleave now, please!\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter.\n\nAfter two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my final decision and if you don\u2019t get out of the way for the Keepers I\u2019ll hex you,\u201d he bellowed.\n\nNeither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry\u2019s head with a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy but aimed well. They now joined the spectators in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member.\n\nHarry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was a delicate shade of green.\n\nNone of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece. To Harry\u2019s great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth.\n\nRon looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven. \u201cGood luck!\u201d cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown. He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial.\n\nYet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggen\u2019s red face inches from his own. He stepped back hastily.\n\n\u201cHis sister didn\u2019t really try,\u201d said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernon\u2019s. \u201cShe gave him an easy save.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Harry coldly. \u201cThat was the one he nearly missed.\u201d\n\nMcLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time.\n\n\u201cGive me another go.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron\u2019s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.\u201d\n\nHe thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him, but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away, growling what sounded like threats to thin air.\n\nHarry turned around to find his new team beaming at him.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d he croaked. \u201cYou flew really well \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did brilliantly, Ron!\u201d\n\nThis time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione.\n\nAfter fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagrid\u2019s. A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be something to eat at Hagrid\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,\u201d Ron was saying happily. \u201cTricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, you were magnificent,\u201d said Hermione, looking amused.\n\n\u201cI was better than that McLaggen anyway,\u201d said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. \u201cDid you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? Looked like he\u2019d been Confunded. . . .\u201d\n\nTo Harry\u2019s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail.\n\nThe great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of Hagrid\u2019s cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them.\n\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d said Hermione nervously. \u201cHe\u2019s still a bit scary, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome off it, you\u2019ve ridden him, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHarry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak sank into a bow too.\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d Harry asked him in a low voice, moving forward to stroke the feathery head. \u201cMissing him? But you\u2019re okay here with Hagrid, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d said a loud voice.\n\nHagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward.\n\n\u201cGit away from him! He\u2019ll have yer fingers \u2014 oh. It\u2019s yeh lot.\u201d\n\nFang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick their ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second, then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind him.\n\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d said Hermione, looking stricken.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d said Harry grimly. He walked over to the door and knocked loudly.\n\n\u201cHagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!\u201d\n\nThere was no sound from within.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t open the door, we\u2019ll blast it open!\u201d Harry said, pulling out his wand.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d said Hermione, sounding shocked. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I can!\u201d said Harry. \u201cStand back \u2014\u201d\n\nBut before he could say anything else, the door flew open again as Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively alarming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a teacher!\u201d he roared at Harry. \u201cA teacher, Potter! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir,\u201d said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes.\n\nHagrid looked stunned. \u201cSince when have yeh called me \u2018sir\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when have you called me \u2018Potter\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very clever,\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cVery amusin\u2019. That\u2019s me outsmarted, innit? All righ\u2019, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . .\u201d\n\nMumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione scurried in after Harry, looking rather frightened.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head immediately upon Harry\u2019s knee and drooling all over his robes. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Feelin\u2019 sorry for me? Reckon I\u2019m lonely or summat?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cWe wanted to see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve missed you!\u201d said Hermione tremulously.\n\n\u201cMissed me, have yeh?\u201d snorted Hagrid. \u201cYeah. Righ\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid\u2019s cooking, and took one at once.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, \u201cwe really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.\u201d\n\nHagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner.\n\n\u201cWe did!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut none of us could fit it into our schedules!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Righ\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid again.\n\nThere was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around: Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing.\n\n\u201cWhat are they, Hagrid?\u201d asked Harry, trying to sound interested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the same.\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 giant grubs,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cAnd they grow into . . . ?\u201d said Ron, looking apprehensive.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019 grow inter nuthin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cI got \u2019em ter feed ter Aragog.\u201d\n\nAnd without warning, he burst into tears.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . him . . .\u201d gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . Aragog. . . . I think he\u2019s dyin\u2019. . . . He got ill over the summer an\u2019 he\u2019s not gettin\u2019 better. . . . I don\u2019 know what I\u2019ll do if he . . . if he . . . We\u2019ve bin tergether so long. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione patted Hagrid\u2019s shoulder, looking at a complete loss for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously.\n\n\u201cIs there \u2014 is there anything we can do?\u201d Hermione asked, ignoring Ron\u2019s frantic grimaces and head-shakings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019 think there is, Hermione,\u201d choked Hagrid, attempting to stem the flood of his tears. \u201cSee, the rest o\u2019 the tribe . . . Aragog\u2019s family . . . they\u2019re gettin\u2019 a bit funny now he\u2019s ill . . . bit restive . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,\u201d said Ron in an undertone.\n\n\u201c. . . I don\u2019 reckon it\u2019d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo\u2019,\u201d Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up. \u201cBut thanks fer offerin\u2019, Hermione. . . . It means a lot. . . .\u201d\n\nAfter that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more.\n\n\u201cAr, I always knew yeh\u2019d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables,\u201d he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. \u201cEven if yeh applied fer Time-Turners \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last summer. It was in the Daily Prophet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAr, well then,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThere\u2019s no way yeh could\u2019ve done it. . . . I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve bin \u2014 yeh know \u2014 I\u2019ve jus\u2019 bin worried abou\u2019 Aragog . . . an\u2019 I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank had bin teachin\u2019 yeh \u2014\u201d\n\nAt which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite cheerful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d said Harry, once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven\u2019t got much time for dinner. . . .\u201d\n\nAs they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but Harry caught Hermione\u2019s arm and held her back.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Hermione defensively.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me,\u201d said Harry quietly, \u201cMcLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting.\u201d\n\nHermione blushed.\n\n\u201cOh, all right then, I did it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, he\u2019s got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn\u2019t get in \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t have wanted someone like that on the team.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo, I suppose that\u2019s true. But wasn\u2019t that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you\u2019re a prefect, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, be quiet,\u201d she snapped, as he smirked.\n\n\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d demanded Ron, reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harry\u2019s stomach ache with hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them, blocking their path.\n\n\u201cHarry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!\u201d he boomed genially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly. \u201cI was hoping to catch you before dinner! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We\u2019re having a little party, just a few rising stars, I\u2019ve got McLaggen coming and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries \u2014 and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too.\u201d\n\nSlughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as look at him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come, Professor,\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cI\u2019ve got a detention with Professor Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d said Slughorn, his face falling comically. \u201cDear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I\u2019ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I\u2019ll see you both later!\u201d\n\nHe bustled away out of the Hall.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got no chance of persuading Snape,\u201d said Harry, the moment Slughorn was out of earshot. \u201cThis detention\u2019s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won\u2019t do it for anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I wish you could come, I don\u2019t want to go on my own!\u201d said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen.\n\n\u201cI doubt you\u2019ll be alone, Ginny\u2019ll probably be invited,\u201d snapped Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn.\n\nAfter dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was very crowded, as most people had finished dinner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down; Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody had left abandoned on a chair.\n\n\u201cAnything new?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNot really . . .\u201d Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages. \u201cOh, look, your dad\u2019s in here, Ron \u2014 he\u2019s all right!\u201d she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in alarm. \u201cIt just says he\u2019s been to visit the Malfoys\u2019 house. \u2018This second search of the Death Eater\u2019s residence does not seem to have yielded any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, mine!\u201d said Harry. \u201cI told him at King\u2019s Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it\u2019s not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how can he have done, Harry?\u201d said Hermione, putting down the newspaper with a surprised look. \u201cWe were all searched when we arrived, weren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you?\u201d said Harry, taken aback. \u201cI wasn\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, of course you weren\u2019t, I forgot you were late. . . . Well, Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy can\u2019t have brought in anything dangerous!\u201d\n\nMomentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s sent it to him by owl, then,\u201d he said. \u201cHis mother or someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the owls are being checked too,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cFilch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach.\u201d\n\nReally stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say. There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown.\n\n\u201cCan you think of any way Malfoy \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, drop it, Harry,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cListen, it\u2019s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!\u201d said Harry, firing up.\n\n\u201cWell, as I\u2019m not invited to any parties,\u201d said Ron, getting to his feet again, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d\n\nHe stomped off toward the door to the boys\u2019 dormitories, leaving Harry and Hermione staring after him.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing suddenly at his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve got a message for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom Professor Slughorn?\u201d asked Harry, sitting up hopefully.\n\n\u201cNo . . . from Professor Snape,\u201d said Demelza. Harry\u2019s heart sank. \u201cHe says you\u2019re to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention \u2014 er \u2014 no matter how many party invitations you\u2019ve received. And he wanted you to know you\u2019ll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and \u2014 and he says there\u2019s no need to bring protective gloves.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry grimly. \u201cThanks a lot, Demelza.\u201d"}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter12": "SILVER AND OPALS\n\n\n\n\nWhere was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.\n\nHalfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.\n\nHarry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Prince\u2019s copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.\n\nHarry had already attempted a few of the Prince\u2019s self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.\n\nSitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:\n\nLevicorpus (nvbl)\n\n\n\nWhile the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl . . . that had to mean \u201cnonverbal.\u201d Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.\n\nPointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head.\n\n\u201cAaaaaaaargh!\u201d\n\nThere was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle.\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of bed. \u201cHang on \u2014 I\u2019ll let you down \u2014\u201d\n\nHe groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might.\n\nThere was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d said Ron in a muffled voice, \u201cI\u2019d rather you set the alarm clock.\u201d\n\nBy the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron\u2019s shock had subsided and he had decided that Harry\u2019s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast.\n\n\u201c. . . and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again!\u201d Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages.\n\nHermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.\n\n\u201cWas this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?\u201d she asked.\n\nHarry frowned at her.\n\n\u201cAlways jump to the worst conclusion, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . yeah, it was, but so what?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does it matter if it\u2019s handwritten?\u201d said Harry, preferring not to answer the rest of the question.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s probably not Ministry of Magic\u2013approved,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd also,\u201d she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, \u201cbecause I\u2019m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.\u201d\n\nBoth Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.\n\n\u201cIt was a laugh!\u201d said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. \u201cJust a laugh, Hermione, that\u2019s all!\u201d\n\n\u201cDangling people upside down by the ankle?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWho puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cFred and George,\u201d said Ron, shrugging, \u201cit\u2019s their kind of thing. And, er \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dad,\u201d said Harry. He had only just remembered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron and Hermione together.\n\n\u201cMy dad used this spell,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI \u2014 Lupin told me.\u201d\n\nThis last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be \u2014 ?\n\n\u201cMaybe your dad did use it, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cbut he\u2019s not the only one. We\u2019ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you\u2019ve forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid.\n\n\u201cThat was different,\u201d he said robustly. \u201cThey were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don\u2019t like the Prince, Hermione,\u201d he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, \u201cbecause he\u2019s better than you at Potions \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with that!\u201d said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. \u201cI just think it\u2019s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re for, and stop talking about \u2018the Prince\u2019 as if it\u2019s his title, I bet it\u2019s just a stupid nickname, and it doesn\u2019t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see where you get that from,\u201d said Harry heatedly. \u201cIf he\u2019d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn\u2019t have been boasting about being \u2018half-blood,\u2019 would he?\u201d\n\nEven as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later. . . .\n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters can\u2019t all be pure-blood, there aren\u2019t enough pure-blood wizards left,\u201d said Hermione stubbornly. \u201cI expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It\u2019s only Muggle-borns they hate, they\u2019d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way they\u2019d let me be a Death Eater!\u201d said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. \u201cMy whole family are blood traitors! That\u2019s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019d love to have me,\u201d said Harry sarcastically. \u201cWe\u2019d be best pals if they didn\u2019t keep trying to do me in.\u201d\n\nThis made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.\n\n\u201cHey, Harry, I\u2019m supposed to give you this.\u201d\n\nIt was a scroll of parchment with Harry\u2019s name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing.\n\n\u201cThanks, Ginny . . . It\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s next lesson!\u201d Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents. \u201cMonday evening!\u201d He felt suddenly light and happy. \u201cWant to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going with Dean \u2014 might see you there,\u201d she replied, waving at them as she left.\n\nFilch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.\n\n\u201cWhat does it matter if we\u2019re smuggling Dark stuff OUT?\u201d demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension. \u201cSurely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?\u201d\n\nHis cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet.\n\nThe walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko\u2019s Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop.\n\n\u201cThank God,\u201d shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffee-scented air. \u201cLet\u2019s stay here all afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, m\u2019boy!\u201d said a booming voice from behind them.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop.\n\n\u201cHarry, that\u2019s three of my little suppers you\u2019ve missed now!\u201d said Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. \u201cIt won\u2019t do, m\u2019boy, I\u2019m determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione helplessly, \u201cthey\u2019re really \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t you come along, Harry?\u201d demanded Slughorn.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,\u201d said Harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.\n\n\u201cWell, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work!\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cBut a little recreation never hurt anybody. Now, how about Monday night, you can\u2019t possibly want to practice in this weather. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Professor, I\u2019ve got \u2014 er \u2014 an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlucky again!\u201d cried Slughorn dramatically. \u201cAh, well . . . you can\u2019t evade me forever, Harry!\u201d\n\nAnd with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve wriggled out of another one,\u201d said Hermione, shaking her head. \u201cThey\u2019re not that bad, you know. . . . They\u2019re even quite fun sometimes. . . .\u201d But then she caught sight of Ron\u2019s expression. \u201cOh, look \u2014 they\u2019ve got deluxe sugar quills \u2014 those would last hours!\u201d\n\nGlad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go next.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Three Broomsticks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019ll be warm.\u201d\n\nThey bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog\u2019s Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was.\n\n\u201cMundungus!\u201d\n\nThe squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.\n\n\u201cOh, \u2019ello, \u2019Arry,\u201d said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. \u201cWell, don\u2019t let me keep ya.\u201d\n\nAnd he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.\n\n\u201cAre you selling this stuff?\u201d asked Harry, watching Mundungus grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground.\n\n\u201cOh, well, gotta scrape a living,\u201d said Mundungus. \u201cGimme that!\u201d\n\nRon had stooped down and picked up something silver.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d Ron said slowly. \u201cThis looks familiar \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ron\u2019s hand and stuffing it back into the case. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you all \u2014 OUCH!\u201d\n\nHarry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d squealed Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou took that from Sirius\u2019s house,\u201d said Harry, who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. \u201cThat had the Black family crest on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 no \u2014 what \u2014 ?\u201d spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly turning purple.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?\u201d snarled Harry.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 no \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you mustn\u2019t!\u201d shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue.\n\nThere was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus\u2019s throat. Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case, then \u2014 CRACK \u2014 he Disapparated.\n\nHarry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone.\n\n\u201cCOME BACK, YOU THIEVING \u2014 !\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point, Harry.\u201d\n\nTonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet.\n\n\u201cMundungus will probably be in London by now. There\u2019s no point yelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s nicked Sirius\u2019s stuff! Nicked it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but still,\u201d said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information. \u201cYou should get out of the cold.\u201d\n\nShe watched them go through the door of the Three Broomsticks.\n\nThe moment he was inside, Harry burst out, \u201cHe was nicking Sirius\u2019s stuff!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, Harry, but please don\u2019t shout, people are staring,\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cGo and sit down, I\u2019ll get you a drink.\u201d\n\nHarry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t the Order control Mundungus?\u201d Harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. \u201cCan\u2019t they at least stop him stealing everything that\u2019s not fixed down when he\u2019s at headquarters?\u201d\n\n\u201cShh!\u201d said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away. \u201cHarry, I\u2019d be annoyed too, I know it\u2019s your things he\u2019s stealing \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s my stuff!\u201d he said. \u201cNo wonder he wasn\u2019t pleased to see me! Well, I\u2019m going to tell Dumbledore what\u2019s going on, he\u2019s the only one who scares Mundungus.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry was calming down. \u201cRon, what are you staring at?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot.\n\n\u201cI expect \u2018nothing\u2019s\u2019 in the back getting more firewhisky,\u201d said Hermione waspishly.\n\nRon ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar. The moment Harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said, \u201cShall we call it a day and go back to school, then?\u201d\n\nThe other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves, then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the High Street. Harry\u2019s thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifoot\u2019s Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.\n\nIt was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct figures. The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was holding in her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with you, Leanne!\u201d Harry heard Katie say.\n\nThey rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast, blurring Harry\u2019s glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground.\n\nAt once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, something eerie. . . . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching.\n\nThen, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Katie\u2019s ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katie\u2019s legs, she fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognize any of them.\n\nHarry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted.\n\n\u201cStay there!\u201d he shouted at the others over the howling wind. \u201cI\u2019m going for help!\u201d\n\nHe began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. \u201cJus\u2019 bin visitin\u2019 Grawp, he\u2019s comin\u2019 on so well yeh wouldn\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, someone\u2019s hurt back there, or cursed, or something \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWha\u2019?\u201d said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was saying over the raging wind.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s been cursed!\u201d bellowed Harry.\n\n\u201cCursed? Who\u2019s bin cursed \u2014 not Ron? Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not them, it\u2019s Katie Bell \u2014 this way . . .\u201d\n\nTogether they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to quiet her.\n\n\u201cGet back!\u201d shouted Hagrid. \u201cLemme see her!\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s happened to her!\u201d sobbed Leanne. \u201cI don\u2019t know what \u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent down, scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Katie\u2019s piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind.\n\nHermione hurried over to Katie\u2019s wailing friend and put an arm around her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Leanne, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded.\n\n\u201cDid it just happen all of a sudden, or \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was when that package tore,\u201d sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d\n\nHe crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that before,\u201d said Harry, staring at the thing. \u201cIt was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have touched it.\u201d He looked up at Leanne, who had started to shake uncontrollably. \u201cHow did Katie get hold of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s why we were arguing. She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said it. . . . Oh no, oh no, I bet she\u2019d been Imperiused and I didn\u2019t realize!\u201d\n\nLeanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder gently.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t say who\u2019d given it to her, Leanne?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo . . . she wouldn\u2019t tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn\u2019t listen and . . . and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and \u2014 and \u2014\u201d\n\nLeanne let out a wail of despair.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better get up to school,\u201d said Hermione, her arm still around Leanne. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ron\u2019s gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,\u201d he said.\n\nAs they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was thinking furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer.\n\n\u201cMalfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I dunno, Harry,\u201d said Ron hesitantly. \u201cLoads of people go to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn\u2019t that girl say Katie got it in the girls\u2019 bathroom?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn\u2019t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMcGonagall!\u201d said Ron warningly.\n\nHarry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them.\n\n\u201cHagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell \u2014 upstairs to my office at once, please! What\u2019s that you\u2019re holding, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the thing she touched,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cGood lord,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry. \u201cNo, no, Filch, they\u2019re with me!\u201d she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. \u201cTake this necklace to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!\u201d\n\nHarry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into her office. The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the still sobbing Leanne.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\nHaltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there was no getting another word out of her.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, \u201cgo up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.\u201d\n\nWhen she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat happened when Katie touched the necklace?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe rose up in the air,\u201d said Harry, before either Ron or Hermione could speak, \u201cand then began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised.\n\n\u201cAway?\u201d Harry repeated angrily.\n\n\u201cYes, Potter, away!\u201d said Professor McGonagall tartly. \u201cBut anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, I\u2019m sure!\u201d\n\nFor a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at.\n\n\u201cI think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.\u201d\n\nOn one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry.\n\n\u201cThat is a very serious accusation, Potter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. \u201cDo you have any proof?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut . . .\u201d and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mr. Borgin.\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused.\n\n\u201cMalfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn\u2019t have it with him. But that\u2019s not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry,\u201d Hermione interrupted, \u201cBorgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he didn\u2019t want to touch it, obviously!\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\n\u201cWhat he actually said was, \u2018How would I look carrying that down the street?\u2019\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,\u201d interjected Ron.\n\n\u201cOh, Ron,\u201d said Hermione despairingly, \u201cit would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn\u2019t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street \u2014 and in any case,\u201d she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, \u201cI asked Borgin about the necklace, don\u2019t you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn\u2019t say it was already sold or anything \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn\u2019t going to tell you \u2014 anyway, Malfoy could\u2019ve sent off for it since \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. \u201cPotter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 that\u2019s what I said \u2014\u201d muttered Ron.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and what is more,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, \u201cMr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.\u201d\n\nHarry gaped at her, deflating.\n\n\u201cHow do you know, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,\u201d she said as she marched past them, \u201cbut I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.\u201d\n\nShe held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word.\n\nHarry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened.\n\n\u201cSo who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?\u201d asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room.\n\n\u201cGoodness only knows,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could\u2019ve been meant for loads of people,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDumbledore \u2014 the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn \u2014 Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they can\u2019t be pleased that he\u2019s sided with Dumbledore. Or \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOr you,\u201d said Hermione, looking troubled.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d said Harry, \u201cor Katie would\u2019ve just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn\u2019t she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, Malfoy wasn\u2019t in Hogsmeade!\u201d said Hermione, actually stamping her foot in frustration.\n\n\u201cHe must have used an accomplice, then,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCrabbe or Goyle \u2014 or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he\u2019ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he\u2019s joined up \u2014\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said There\u2019s no point arguing with him.\n\n\u201cDilligrout,\u201d said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady.\n\nThe portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katie\u2019s fate had not yet spread.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,\u201d said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. \u201cThe curse didn\u2019t even make it into the castle. Not what you\u2019d call foolproof.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very well thought-out at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut since when has Malfoy been one of the world\u2019s great thinkers?\u201d asked Harry.\n\nNeither Ron nor Hermione answered him."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter13": "THE SECRET RIDDLE\n\n\n\n\nKatie was removed to St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school, though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target.\n\n\u201cOh, and Malfoy knows, of course,\u201d said Harry to Ron and Hermione, who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory.\n\nHarry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday night\u2019s lesson, but having had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside Dumbledore\u2019s office at eight o\u2019clock, knocked, and was told to enter. There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired; his hand was as black and burned as ever, but he smiled when he gestured to Harry to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling.\n\n\u201cYou have had a busy time while I have been away,\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cI believe you witnessed Katie\u2019s accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. How is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cStill very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin: There was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy him?\u201d asked Harry quickly. \u201cWhy not Madam Pomfrey?\u201d\n\n\u201cImpertinent,\u201d said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius\u2019s great-great-grandfather, raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping. \u201cI would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, thank you, Phineas,\u201d said Dumbledore quellingly. \u201cProfessor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungo\u2019s staff are sending me hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere were you this weekend, sir?\u201d Harry asked, disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly.\n\n\u201cI would rather not say just now,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHowever, I shall tell you in due course.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will?\u201d said Harry, startled.\n\n\u201cYes, I expect so,\u201d said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Harry tentatively, \u201cI met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt,\u201d said Dumbledore, frowning a little. \u201cHe has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Sirius\u2019s old possessions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms?\u201d said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he stalked out of his frame, undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld Place.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d said Harry, after a short pause, \u201cdid Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me of your suspicions, yes,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cAnd do you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katie\u2019s accident,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.\u201d\n\nHarry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second? However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his long-fingered hands.\n\n\u201cYou will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort\u2019s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know she was in London, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwho, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.\u201d\n\nHe swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes.\n\n\u201cYes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now. She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious. Covered in rags and pretty far along . . . Going to have a baby, see. She said the locket had been Slytherin\u2019s. Well, we hear that sort of story all the time, \u2018Oh, this was Merlin\u2019s, this was, his favorite teapot,\u2019 but when I looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that made it near enough priceless. She didn\u2019t seem to have any idea how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bargain we ever made!\u201d\n\nDumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come.\n\n\u201cHe only gave her ten Galleons?\u201d said Harry indignantly.\n\n\u201cCaractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cSo we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvolo\u2019s treasured family heirlooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she could do magic!\u201d said Harry impatiently. \u201cShe could have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cperhaps she could. But it is my belief \u2014 I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right \u2014 that when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course, it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t even stay alive for her son?\u201d\n\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. \u201cCould you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry quickly, \u201cbut she had a choice, didn\u2019t she, not like my mother \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother had a choice too,\u201d said Dumbledore gently. \u201cYes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother\u2019s courage. And now, if you will stand . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk.\n\n\u201cThis time,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwe are going to enter my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate. After you, Harry . . .\u201d\n\nHarry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again. . . . Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old-fashioned London street.\n\n\u201cThere I am,\u201d said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn milk cart.\n\nThis younger Albus Dumbledore\u2019s long hair and beard were auburn. Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing.\n\n\u201cNice suit, sir,\u201d said Harry, before he could stop himself, but Dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings. He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore\u2019s eccentric appearance. \u201cUm . . . just a mo\u2019 . . . MRS. COLE!\u201d she bellowed over her shoulder.\n\nHarry heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl turned back to Dumbledore. \u201cCome in, she\u2019s on \u2019er way.\u201d\n\nDumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Harry and the older Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward them. She had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore.\n\n\u201c. . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley\u2019s oozing all over his sheets \u2014 chicken pox on top of everything else,\u201d she said to nobody in particular, and then her eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said Dumbledore, holding out his hand.\n\nMrs. Cole simply gaped.\n\n\u201cMy name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.\u201d\n\nMrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination, she said feebly, \u201cOh yes. Well \u2014 well then \u2014 you\u2019d better come into my room. Yes.\u201d\n\nShe led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room, part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him nervously.\n\n\u201cI am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cAre you family?\u201d asked Mrs. Cole.\n\n\u201cNo, I am a teacher,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have come to offer Tom a place at my school.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat school\u2019s this, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is called Hogwarts,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cAnd how come you\u2019re interested in Tom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe he has qualities we are looking for.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean he\u2019s won a scholarship? How can he have done? He\u2019s never been entered for one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, his name has been down for our school since birth \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho registered him? His parents?\u201d\n\nThere was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Cole\u2019s desktop.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper, \u201cI think this will make everything clear.\u201d\n\nMrs. Cole\u2019s eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment.\n\n\u201cThat seems perfectly in order,\u201d she said placidly, handing it back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 may I offer you a glass of gin?\u201d she said in an extra-refined voice.\n\n\u201cThank you very much,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming.\n\nIt soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn\u2019t hesitate to press his advantage.\n\n\u201cI was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle\u2019s history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. \u201cI remember it clear as anything, because I\u2019d just started here myself. New Year\u2019s Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn\u2019t the first. We took her in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was dead in another hour.\u201d\n\nMrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin.\n\n\u201cDid she say anything before she died?\u201d asked Dumbledore. \u201cAnything about the boy\u2019s father, for instance?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, as it happens, she did,\u201d said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story. \u201cI remember she said to me, \u2018I hope he looks like his papa,\u2019 and I won\u2019t lie, she was right to hope it, because she was no beauty \u2014 and then she told me he was to be named Tom, for his father, and Marvolo, for her father \u2014 yes, I know, funny name, isn\u2019t it? We wondered whether she came from a circus \u2014 and she said the boy\u2019s surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon after that without another word.\n\n\u201cWell, we named him just as she\u2019d said, it seemed so important to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the orphanage and he\u2019s been here ever since.\u201d\n\nMrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones. Then she said, \u201cHe\u2019s a funny boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI thought he might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And then, when he got a little older, he was . . . odd.\u201d\n\n\u201cOdd in what way?\u201d asked Dumbledore gently.\n\n\u201cWell, he \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely got a place at your school, you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cAnd nothing I say can change that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be taking him away, whatever?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d repeated Dumbledore gravely.\n\nShe squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, \u201cHe scares the other children.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean he is a bully?\u201d asked Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI think he must be,\u201d said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, \u201cbut it\u2019s very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty things . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still.\n\n\u201cBilly Stubbs\u2019s rabbit . . . well, Tom said he didn\u2019t do it and I don\u2019t see how he could have done, but even so, it didn\u2019t hang itself from the rafters, did it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think so, no,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And then\u201d \u2014 Mrs. Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this time \u2014 \u201con the summer outing \u2014 we take them out, you know, once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside \u2014 well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all we ever got out of them was that they\u2019d gone into a cave with Tom Riddle. He swore they\u2019d just gone exploring, but something happened in there, I\u2019m sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of things, funny things. . . .\u201d\n\nShe looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks were flushed, her gaze was steady. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people will be sorry to see the back of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou understand, I\u2019m sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe will have to return here, at the very least, every summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker,\u201d said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though two-thirds of the gin was now gone. \u201cI suppose you\u2019d like to see him?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery much,\u201d said Dumbledore, rising too.\n\nShe led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed. The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic. They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up.\n\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She knocked twice and entered.\n\n\u201cTom? You\u2019ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton \u2014 sorry, Dunderbore. He\u2019s come to tell you \u2014 well, I\u2019ll let him do it.\u201d\n\nHarry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe, a wooden chair, and an iron bedstead. A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs stretched out in front of him, holding a book.\n\nThere was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle\u2019s face. Merope had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledore\u2019s eccentric appearance. There was a moment\u2019s silence.\n\n\u201cHow do you do, Tom?\u201d said Dumbledore, walking forward and holding out his hand.\n\nThe boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.\n\n\u201cI am Professor Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Professor\u2019?\u201d repeated Riddle. He looked wary. \u201cIs that like \u2018doctor\u2019? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look at me?\u201d\n\nHe was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cShe wants me looked at, doesn\u2019t she? Tell the truth!\u201d\n\nHe spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring, though he looked, if anything, warier still.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my school \u2014 your new school, if you would like to come.\u201d\n\nRiddle\u2019s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t kid me! The asylum, that\u2019s where you\u2019re from, isn\u2019t it? \u2018Professor,\u2019 yes, of course \u2014 well, I\u2019m not going, see? That old cat\u2019s the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they\u2019ll tell you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not from the asylum,\u201d said Dumbledore patiently. \u201cI am a teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see them try,\u201d sneered Riddle.\n\n\u201cHogwarts,\u201d Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard Riddle\u2019s last words, \u201cis a school for people with special abilities \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad people. It is a school of magic.\u201d\n\nThere was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledore\u2019s, as though trying to catch one of them lying.\n\n\u201cMagic?\u201d he repeated in a whisper.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s magic, what I can do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it that you can do?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll sorts,\u201d breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. \u201cI can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want to.\u201d\n\nHis legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in prayer.\n\n\u201cI knew I was different,\u201d he whispered to his own quivering fingers. \u201cI knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you were quite right,\u201d said Dumbledore, who was no longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. \u201cYou are a wizard.\u201d\n\nRiddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial.\n\n\u201cAre you a wizard too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cProve it,\u201d said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said, \u201cTell the truth.\u201d\n\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwarts \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I am!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you will address me as \u2018Professor\u2019 or \u2018sir.\u2019\u201d\n\nRiddle\u2019s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I meant \u2014 please, Professor, could you show me \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHarry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.\n\nThe wardrobe burst into flames.\n\nRiddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.\n\nRiddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. \u201cWhere can I get one of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll in good time,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe.\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it. For the first time, Riddle looked frightened.\n\n\u201cOpen the door,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nRiddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.\n\n\u201cTake it out,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nRiddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.\n\n\u201cIs there anything in that box that you ought not to have?\u201d asked Dumbledore.\n\nRiddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. \u201cYes, I suppose so, sir,\u201d he said finally, in an expressionless voice.\n\n\u201cOpen it,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nRiddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them. Harry, who had expected something much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo, a silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets.\n\n\u201cYou will return them to their owners with your apologies,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. \u201cI shall know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nRiddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Hogwarts,\u201d Dumbledore went on, \u201cwe teach you not only to use magic, but to control it. You have \u2014 inadvertently, I am sure \u2014 been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic \u2014 yes, there is a Ministry \u2014 will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Riddle again.\n\nIt was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly, \u201cI haven\u2019t got any money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is easily remedied,\u201d said Dumbledore, drawing a leather money-pouch from his pocket. \u201cThere is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you buy spellbooks?\u201d interrupted Riddle, who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat gold Galleon.\n\n\u201cIn Diagon Alley,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have your list of books and school equipment with me. I can help you find everything \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming with me?\u201d asked Riddle, looking up.\n\n\u201cCertainly, if you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cI\u2019m used to doing things for myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you get to this Diagon Alley \u2014 sir?\u201d he added, catching Dumbledore\u2019s eye.\n\nHarry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage, he said, \u201cYou will be able to see it, although Muggles around you \u2014 non-magical people, that is \u2014 will not. Ask for Tom the barman \u2014 easy enough to remember, as he shares your name \u2014\u201d\n\nRiddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an irksome fly.\n\n\u201cYou dislike the name \u2018Tom\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Toms,\u201d muttered Riddle. Then, as though he could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in spite of himself, he asked, \u201cWas my father a wizard? He was called Tom Riddle too, they\u2019ve told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.\n\n\u201cMy mother can\u2019t have been magic, or she wouldn\u2019t have died,\u201d said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. \u201cIt must\u2019ve been him. So \u2014 when I\u2019ve got all my stuff \u2014 when do I come to this Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYou will leave from King\u2019s Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.\u201d\n\nRiddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, \u201cI can speak to snakes. I found out when we\u2019ve been to the country on trips \u2014 they find me, they whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?\u201d\n\nHarry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment, determined to impress.\n\n\u201cIt is unusual,\u201d said Dumbledore, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, \u201cbut not unheard of.\u201d\n\nHis tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle\u2019s face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that will do,\u201d said the white-haired Dumbledore at Harry\u2019s side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the present-day office.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.\n\nHarry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.\n\n\u201cHe believed it much quicker than I did \u2014 I mean, when you told him he was a wizard,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was \u2014 to use his word \u2014 \u2018special,\u2019\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cDid you know \u2014 then?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cDid I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNo, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others\u2019 sake as much as his.\n\n\u201cHis powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for such a young wizard and \u2014 most interestingly and ominously of all \u2014 he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw, they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards: He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . . . \u2018I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he was a Parselmouth,\u201d interjected Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.\n\n\u201cTime is making fools of us again,\u201d said Dumbledore, indicating the dark sky beyond the windows. \u201cBut before we part, I want to draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be discussing in future meetings.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I hope you noticed Riddle\u2019s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name, \u2018Tom\u2019?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cThere he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of \u2018Lord Voldemort\u2019 behind which he has been hidden for so long.\n\n\u201cI trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly self-sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.\n\n\u201cAnd lastly \u2014 I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this, Harry \u2014 the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later.\n\n\u201cAnd now, it really is time for bed.\u201d\n\nHarry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunt\u2019s ring had rested last time, but the ring was no longer there.\n\n\u201cYes, Harry?\u201d said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.\n\n\u201cThe ring\u2019s gone,\u201d said Harry, looking around. \u201cBut I thought you might have the mouth organ or something.\u201d\n\nDumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his half-moon spectacles.\n\n\u201cVery astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.\u201d\n\nAnd on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood himself to be dismissed."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter14": "FELIX FELICIS\n\n\n\n\nHarry had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend\u2019s brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.\n\n\u201cWow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,\u201d said Ron quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this term\u2019s project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t get why Dumbledore\u2019s showing you all this. I mean, it\u2019s really interesting and everything, but what\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Harry, inserting a gum shield. \u201cBut he says it\u2019s all important and it\u2019ll help me survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fascinating,\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \u201cIt makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how was Slughorn\u2019s latest party?\u201d Harry asked her thickly through the gum shield.\n\n\u201cOh, it was quite fun, really,\u201d said Hermione, now putting on protective goggles. \u201cI mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he\u2019s so well-connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.\u201d\n\n\u201cGwenog Jones?\u201d said Ron, his eyes widening under his own goggles. \u201cThe Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cPersonally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite enough chat over here!\u201d said Professor Sprout briskly, bustling over and looking stern. \u201cYou\u2019re lagging behind, everybody else has started, and Neville\u2019s already got his first pod!\u201d\n\nThey looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit.\n\n\u201cOkay, Professor, we\u2019re starting now!\u201d said Ron, adding quietly, when she had turned away again, \u201cshould\u2019ve used Muffliato, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince and his spells. \u201cWell, come on . . . we\u2019d better get going. . . .\u201d\n\nShe gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.\n\nIt sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in Hermione\u2019s hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Neville\u2019s. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood.\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be having any of these in my garden when I\u2019ve got my own place,\u201d said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.\n\n\u201cPass me a bowl,\u201d said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at arm\u2019s length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they\u2019re best when they\u2019re fresh!\u201d called Professor Sprout.\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, \u201cSlughorn\u2019s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.\u201d\n\nHarry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, \u201cAnd this is another party just for Slughorn\u2019s favorites, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust for the Slug Club, yes,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThe pod flew out from under Ron\u2019s fingers and hit the greenhouse glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprout\u2019s head and knocking off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t make up the name \u2018Slug Club\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Slug Club,\u2019\u201d repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don\u2019t you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re allowed to bring guests,\u201d said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, \u201cand I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it\u2019s that stupid then I won\u2019t bother!\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of their conversation.\n\n\u201cYou were going to ask me?\u201d asked Ron, in a completely different voice.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione angrily. \u201cBut obviously if you\u2019d rather I hooked up with McLaggen . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel.\n\n\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Ron, in a very quiet voice.\n\nHarry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.\n\n\u201cReparo,\u201d he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry\u2019s presence. Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.\n\n\u201cHand that over, Harry,\u201d said Hermione hurriedly. \u201cIt says we\u2019re supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump.\n\nIt was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he felt about it. . . . He and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didn\u2019t split up? What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?\n\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.\n\nThe rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughorn\u2019s party. Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn\u2019s dimly lit room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had more pressing worries.\n\nKatie Bell was still in St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital with no prospect of leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was looming, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play.\n\nHarry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout. With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room, all of Hermione\u2019s creation; nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.\n\n\u201cAre you still interested in playing Chaser?\u201d\n\n\u201cWha \u2014 ? Yeah, of course!\u201d said Dean excitedly. Over Dean\u2019s shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnigan slamming his books into his bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts.\n\n\u201cWell then, you\u2019re in,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere\u2019s a practice tonight, seven o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Dean. \u201cCheers, Harry! Blimey, I can\u2019t wait to tell Ginny!\u201d\n\nHe sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on Seamus\u2019s head as one of Hermione\u2019s canaries whizzed over them.\n\nSeamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katie\u2019s substitute. There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered, but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If they lost . . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse mutterings. . . .\n\nHarry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only problem was Ron.\n\nHarry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth.\n\n\u201cIt was an accident, I\u2019m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!\u201d Ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping blood everywhere. \u201cI just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPanicked,\u201d Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. \u201cYou prat, Ron, look at the state of her!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can fix that,\u201d said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing his wand at Demelza\u2019s mouth, and saying \u201cEpiskey.\u201d \u201cAnd Ginny, don\u2019t call Ron a prat, you\u2019re not the Captain of this team \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry forced himself not to laugh.\n\n\u201cIn the air, everyone, let\u2019s go. . . .\u201d\n\nOverall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term, though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match.\n\n\u201cGood work, everyone, I think we\u2019ll flatten Slytherin,\u201d he said bracingly, and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves.\n\n\u201cI played like a sack of dragon dung,\u201d said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.\n\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re the best Keeper I tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.\u201d\n\nHe kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower, however, they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together.\n\nIt was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harry\u2019s stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ron\u2019s voice as though from a great distance away.\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d\n\nDean and Ginny broke apart and looked around.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!\u201d said Ginny.\n\nDean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for Dean\u2019s instant dismissal from the team.\n\n\u201cEr . . . c\u2019mon, Ginny,\u201d said Dean, \u201clet\u2019s go back to the common room. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go!\u201d said Ginny. \u201cI want a word with my dear brother!\u201d\n\nDean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron, \u201clet\u2019s get this straight once and for all. It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it is!\u201d said Ron, just as angrily. \u201cD\u2019you think I want people saying my sister\u2019s a \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. \u201cA what, exactly?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean anything, Ginny \u2014\u201d said Harry automatically, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ron\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cOh yes he does!\u201d she said, flaring up at Harry. \u201cJust because he\u2019s never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he\u2019s ever had is from our Auntie Muriel \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning maroon.\n\n\u201cNo, I will not!\u201d yelled Ginny, beside herself. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you with Phlegm, hoping she\u2019ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it\u2019s pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself, you wouldn\u2019t mind so much that everyone else does it!\u201d\n\nRon had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d Ron roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t do it in public \u2014 !\u201d\n\nGinny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out of the way.\n\n\u201cBeen kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou \u2014\u201d\n\nA streak of orange light flew under Harry\u2019s left arm and missed Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s snogged Cho Chang!\u201d shouted Ginny, who sounded close to tears now. \u201cAnd Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it\u2019s only you who acts like it\u2019s something disgusting, Ron, and that\u2019s because you\u2019ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!\u201d\n\nAnd with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron; the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Filch\u2019s cat, appeared around the corner, which broke the tension.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d said Harry, as the sound of Filch\u2019s shuffling feet reached their ears.\n\nThey hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor. \u201cOi, out of the way!\u201d Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.\n\nHarry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this. It\u2019s just because she\u2019s Ron\u2019s sister, he told himself. You just didn\u2019t like seeing her kissing Dean because she\u2019s Ron\u2019s sister. . . .\n\nBut unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead. . . . The monster in his chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things like \u201cbetrayal of trust\u201d . . . \u201csupposed to be my friend\u201d . . .\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think Hermione did snog Krum?\u201d Ron asked abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone \u2014\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said confusedly. \u201cOh . . . er . . .\u201d\n\nThe honest answer was \u201cyes,\u201d but he did not want to give it. However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cDilligrout,\u201d he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room.\n\nNeither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts.\n\nHarry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not, like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny for years now. . . . It was natural that he should feel protective . . . natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her . . . No . . . he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling. . . .\n\nRon gave a great grunting snore.\n\nShe\u2019s Ron\u2019s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron\u2019s sister. She\u2019s out-of-bounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything. He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny.\n\nHarry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater\u2019s bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys\u2019 dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first years for looking at him.\n\nTo Harry\u2019s dismay, Ron\u2019s new aggression did not wear off over the next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturday\u2019s match, he failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.\n\n\u201cYou shut up and leave her alone!\u201d shouted Peakes, who was about two-thirds Ron\u2019s height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.\n\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering in Ron\u2019s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand. \u201cPeakes, go and pack up the Bludgers. Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today. Ron . . .\u201d he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it, \u201cyou\u2019re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I\u2019m going to kick you off the team.\u201d\n\nHe really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of him and he said, \u201cI resign. I\u2019m pathetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not pathetic and you\u2019re not resigning!\u201d said Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. \u201cYou can save anything when you\u2019re on form, it\u2019s a mental problem you\u2019ve got!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou calling me mental?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, maybe I am!\u201d\n\nThey glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his head wearily. \u201cI know you haven\u2019t got any time to find another Keeper, so I\u2019ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I\u2019m taking myself off the team.\u201d\n\nNothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting Ron\u2019s confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever.\n\nHarry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of winning were very slim. . . .\n\nIf only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .\n\nAnd the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of inspiration.\n\nBreakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen.\n\nThe Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head.\n\n\u201cCheer up, Ron!\u201d called Lavender. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be brilliant!\u201d\n\nRon ignored her.\n\n\u201cTea?\u201d Harry asked him. \u201cCoffee? Pumpkin juice?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything,\u201d said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.\n\nA few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of Ron\u2019s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.\n\n\u201cHow are you both feeling?\u201d she asked tentatively, her eyes on the back of Ron\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice. \u201cThere you go, Ron. Drink up.\u201d\n\nRon had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke sharply.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t drink that, Ron!\u201d\n\nBoth Harry and Ron looked up at her.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes.\n\n\u201cYou just put something in that drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron\u2019s drink. You\u2019ve got the bottle in your hand right now!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Harry, stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket.\n\n\u201cRon, I warn you, don\u2019t drink it!\u201d Hermione said again, alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and said, \u201cStop bossing me around, Hermione.\u201d\n\nShe looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could hear her, she hissed, \u201cYou should be expelled for that. I\u2019d never have believed it of you, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cHark who\u2019s talking,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cConfunded anyone lately?\u201d\n\nShe stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron, who was smacking his lips.\n\n\u201cNearly time,\u201d said Harry blithely.\n\nThe frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium.\n\n\u201cPretty lucky the weather\u2019s this good, eh?\u201d Harry asked Ron.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.\n\nGinny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room.\n\n\u201cConditions look ideal,\u201d said Ginny, ignoring Ron. \u201cAnd guess what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey \u2014 he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice, and he\u2019s too sore to play! And even better than that \u2014 Malfoy\u2019s gone off sick too!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. \u201cHe\u2019s ill? What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea, but it\u2019s great for us,\u201d said Ginny brightly. \u201cThey\u2019re playing Harper instead; he\u2019s in my year and he\u2019s an idiot.\u201d\n\nHarry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on? Was he really ill, or was he faking?\n\n\u201cFishy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said in an undertone to Ron. \u201cMalfoy not playing?\u201d\n\n\u201cLucky, I call it,\u201d said Ron, looking slightly more animated. \u201cAnd Vaisey off too, he\u2019s their best goal scorer, I didn\u2019t fancy \u2014 hey!\u201d he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his Keeper\u2019s gloves and staring at Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . you . . .\u201d Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both scared and excited. \u201cMy drink . . . my pumpkin juice . . . you didn\u2019t . . . ?\u201d\n\nHarry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, \u201cWe\u2019ll be starting in about five minutes, you\u2019d better get your boots on.\u201d\n\nThey walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos. One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood\u2019s famous lion-topped hat.\n\nHarry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate.\n\n\u201cCaptains shake hands,\u201d she said, and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. \u201cMount your brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . .\u201d\n\nThe whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground, and they were away.\n\nHarry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentator\u2019s started up.\n\n\u201cWell, there they go, and I think we\u2019re all surprised to see the team that Potter\u2019s put together this year. Many thought, given Ronald Weasley\u2019s patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship with the Captain does help. . . .\u201d\n\nThese words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentator\u2019s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan\u2019s; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.\n\n\u201cOh, and here comes Slytherin\u2019s first attempt on goal, it\u2019s Urquhart streaking down the pitch and \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach turned over.\n\n\u201c\u2014 Weasley saves it, well, he\u2019s bound to get lucky sometimes, I suppose. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Smith, he is,\u201d muttered Harry, grinning to himself, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.\n\nWith half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves, some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor\u2019s six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.\n\n\u201cOf course, Coote isn\u2019t really the usual build for a Beater,\u201d said Zacharias loftily, \u201cthey\u2019ve generally got a bit more muscle \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHit a Bludger at him!\u201d Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark.\n\nIt seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the old favorite \u201cWeasley Is Our King,\u201d he pretended to conduct them from on high.\n\n\u201cThinks he\u2019s something special today, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d said a snide voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. \u201cYour blood-traitor pal . . .\u201d\n\nMadam Hooch\u2019s back was turned, and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back. . . .\n\n\u201cAnd I think Harper of Slytherin\u2019s seen the Snitch!\u201d said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. \u201cYes, he\u2019s certainly seen something Potter hasn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nSmith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn\u2019t he noticed them collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky \u2014 Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the clear blue sky.\n\nHarry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smith\u2019s commentary or the crowd, but Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. . . .\n\n\u201cOi, Harper!\u201d yelled Harry in desperation. \u201cHow much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?\u201d\n\nHe did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a double-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering ball and caught it.\n\n\u201cYES!\u201d Harry yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.\n\n\u201cGinny, where\u2019re you going?\u201d yelled Harry, who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty crash, she collided with the commentator\u2019s podium. As the crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring; Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, \u201cForgot to brake, Professor, sorry.\u201d\n\nLaughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped a cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air and waving to their supporters.\n\nThe atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant.\n\n\u201cParty up in the common room, Seamus said!\u201d yelled Dean exuberantly. \u201cC\u2019mon, Ginny, Demelza!\u201d\n\nRon and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They were just about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined.\n\n\u201cI want a word with you, Harry.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done it. You heard Slughorn, it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do, turn us in?\u201d demanded Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d asked Harry, turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning.\n\n\u201cYou know perfectly well what we\u2019re talking about!\u201d said Hermione shrilly. \u201cYou spiked Ron\u2019s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry, turning back to face them both.\n\n\u201cYes you did, Harry, and that\u2019s why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t put it in!\u201d said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. \u201cI wanted Ron to think I\u2019d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.\u201d He looked at Ron. \u201cYou saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.\u201d\n\nHe pocketed the potion again.\n\n\u201cThere really wasn\u2019t anything in my pumpkin juice?\u201d Ron said, astounded. \u201cBut the weather\u2019s good . . . and Vaisey couldn\u2019t play. . . . I honestly haven\u2019t been given lucky potion?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. \u201cYou added Felix Felicis to Ron\u2019s juice this morning, that\u2019s why he saved everything! See! I can save goals without help, Hermione!\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said you couldn\u2019t \u2014 Ron, you thought you\u2019d been given it too!\u201d\n\nBut Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this, \u201cshall . . . shall we go up to the party, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go!\u201d said Hermione, blinking back tears. \u201cI\u2019m sick of Ron at the moment, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to have done. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd she stormed out of the changing room too.\n\nHarry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum, not when the offense had occurred so long ago.\n\nHarry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try to find Ron. At last, he extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorn\u2019s Christmas party with him. As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.\n\n\u201cLooking for Ron?\u201d she asked, smirking. \u201cHe\u2019s over there, the filthy hypocrite.\u201d\n\nHarry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.\n\n\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s eating her face, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ginny dispassionately. \u201cBut I suppose he\u2019s got to refine his technique somehow. Good game, Harry.\u201d\n\nShe patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer. Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold.\n\nHarry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight.\n\nHe darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside seemed to be deserted.\n\n\u201cHermione?\u201d\n\nHe found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher\u2019s desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.\n\n\u201cOh, hello, Harry,\u201d she said in a brittle voice. \u201cI was just practicing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . they\u2019re \u2014 er \u2014 really good. . . .\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, \u201cRon seems to be enjoying the celebrations.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . does he?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t see him,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t exactly hiding it, was \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nThe door behind them burst open. To Harry\u2019s horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione.\n\n\u201cOops!\u201d said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, giggling. The door swung shut behind her.\n\nThere was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness, \u201cHi, Harry! Wondered where you\u2019d got to!\u201d\n\nHermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t leave Lavender waiting outside,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cShe\u2019ll wonder where you\u2019ve gone.\u201d\n\nShe walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened.\n\n\u201cOppugno!\u201d came a shriek from the doorway.\n\nHarry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach.\n\n\u201cGerremoffme!\u201d he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter15": "THE UNBREAKABLE VOW\n\n\n\n\nSnow was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already single-handedly delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past, which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however, Harry\u2019s frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle\u2019s secret passageways, so that he was able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes.\n\nRon, who might once have found the necessity of these detours a cause for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing, joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price. Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again.\n\nRon, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermione\u2019s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful tone.\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t complain,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cShe snogged Krum. So she\u2019s found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it\u2019s a free country. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning (Quintessence: A Quest). Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight.\n\n\u201cI never promised Hermione anything,\u201d Ron mumbled. \u201cI mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn\u2019s Christmas party with her, but she never said . . . just as friends . . . I\u2019m a free agent. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron\u2019s voice tailed away in mutters, barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the words \u201cKrum\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t complain\u201d again.\n\nHermione\u2019s schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, so Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,\u201d said Hermione, while the librarian, Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d\n\nShe raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his voice might soon vanish from lack of use. He bent a little lower over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the Prince\u2019s useful additions to Libatius Borage\u2019s text.\n\n\u201cAnd incidentally,\u201d said Hermione, after a few moments, \u201cyou need to be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, \u201cI am not giving back this book, I\u2019ve learned more from the Half-Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,\u201d said Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. \u201cI\u2019m talking about earlier. I went into the girls\u2019 bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They\u2019re all hoping they\u2019re going to get you to take them to Slughorn\u2019s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred and George\u2019s love potions, which I\u2019m afraid to say probably work \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you confiscate them then?\u201d demanded Harry. It seemed extraordinary that Hermione\u2019s mania for upholding rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the potions with them in the bathroom,\u201d said Hermione scornfully. \u201cThey were just discussing tactics. As I doubt whether even the Half-Blood Prince\u201d \u2014 she gave the book another nasty look \u2014 \u201ccould dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once, I\u2019d just invite someone to go with you, that\u2019ll stop all the others thinking they\u2019ve still got a chance. It\u2019s tomorrow night, they\u2019re getting desperate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone I want to invite,\u201d mumbled Harry, who was still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help, despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform Legilimency.\n\n\u201cWell, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane looked like she meant business,\u201d said Hermione grimly.\n\nShe hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill. Harry watched her with his mind a long way away.\n\n\u201cHang on a moment,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned?\u201d asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay.\n\n\u201cBut I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these girls are able to bring love potions into school?\u201d\n\n\u201cFred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s part of their Owl Order Service.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know a lot about it.\u201d\n\nHermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of Advanced Potion-Making.\n\n\u201cIt was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cI don\u2019t go around putting potions in people\u2019s drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just as bad. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, never mind that,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cThe point is, Filch is being fooled, isn\u2019t he? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else! So why couldn\u2019t Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Harry . . . not that again . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, why not?\u201d demanded Harry.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d sighed Hermione, \u201cSecrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don\u2019t they? They\u2019re used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects. They\u2019d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one on that necklace, within seconds. But something that\u2019s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn\u2019t register \u2014 and anyway, love potions aren\u2019t Dark or dangerous \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda Vane.\n\n\u201c\u2014 so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn\u2019t a cough potion, and he\u2019s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying.\n\n\u201cThe library is now closed,\u201d she said. \u201cMind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct \u2014 what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t the library\u2019s, it\u2019s mine!\u201d said Harry hastily, snatching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand.\n\n\u201cDespoiled!\u201d she hissed. \u201cDesecrated! Befouled!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a book that\u2019s been written on!\u201d said Harry, tugging it out of her grip.\n\nShe looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frog-marched him away.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll ban you from the library if you\u2019re not careful. Why did you have to bring that stupid book?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault she\u2019s barking mad, Hermione. Or d\u2019you think she overheard you being rude about Filch? I\u2019ve always thought there might be something going on between them. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, ha ha . . .\u201d\n\nEnjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other.\n\n\u201cBaubles,\u201d said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive password.\n\n\u201cSame to you,\u201d said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, and she swung forward to admit them.\n\n\u201cHi, Harry!\u201d said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole. \u201cFancy a gillywater?\u201d\n\nHermione gave him a \u201cwhat-did-I-tell-you?\u201d look over her shoulder.\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t like it much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, take these anyway,\u201d said Romilda, thrusting a box into his hands. \u201cChocolate Cauldrons, they\u2019ve got firewhisky in them. My gran sent them to me, but I don\u2019t like them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 right \u2014 thanks a lot,\u201d said Harry, who could not think what else to say. \u201cEr \u2014 I\u2019m just going over here with . . .\u201d\n\nHe hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly.\n\n\u201cTold you,\u201d said Hermione succinctly. \u201cSooner you ask someone, sooner they\u2019ll all leave you alone and you can \u2014\u201d\n\nBut her face suddenly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were entwined in the same armchair.\n\n\u201cWell, good night, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, though it was only seven o\u2019clock in the evening, and she left for the girls\u2019 dormitory without another word.\n\nHarry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn\u2019s party, after which he and Ron would depart together for the Burrow. It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior. . . .\n\nBut his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron\u2019s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron\u2019s just now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.\n\nHe finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls\u2019 bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back.\n\n\u201cOh, hello, Harry,\u201d said Luna. \u201cDid you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .\u201d\n\nHe held out her books.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case. \u201cThank you, Harry. Well, I\u2019d better get going. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a bit upset,\u201d said Luna. \u201cI thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about that Ron Weasley. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019ve had a row,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHe says very funny things sometimes, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d said Luna, as they set off down the corridor together. \u201cBut he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose,\u201d said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her. \u201cSo have you had a good term?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s been all right,\u201d said Luna. \u201cA bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny\u2019s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me \u2018Loony\u2019 the other day \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow would you like to come to Slughorn\u2019s party with me tonight?\u201d\n\nThe words were out of Harry\u2019s mouth before he could stop them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking.\n\nLuna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise.\n\n\u201cSlughorn\u2019s party? With you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like . . . I mean . . .\u201d He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear. \u201cI mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don\u2019t want to . . .\u201d\n\nHe was already half hoping that she didn\u2019t want to.\n\n\u201cOh, no, I\u2019d love to go with you as friends!\u201d said Luna, beaming as he had never seen her beam before. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I do mine too?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry firmly, \u201cthat was a mistake. I\u2019ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So, I\u2019ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o\u2019clock then.\u201d\n\n\u201cAHA!\u201d screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed right underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them.\n\n\u201cPotty asked Loony to go to the party! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuurves Looooooony!\u201d\n\nAnd he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, \u201cPotty loves Loony!\u201d\n\n\u201cNice to keep these things private,\u201d said Harry. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn\u2019s party.\n\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve taken anyone!\u201d said Ron in disbelief over dinner. \u201cAnyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call her that, Ron,\u201d snapped Ginny, pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re taking her, Harry, she\u2019s so excited.\u201d\n\nAnd she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party, but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table, Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively.\n\n\u201cYou could say sorry,\u201d suggested Harry bluntly.\n\n\u201cWhat, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?\u201d muttered Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat did you have to imitate her for?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe laughed at my mustache!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did I, it was the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nBut Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHow\u2019re you? You\u2019re staying at Hogwarts, then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI managed to talk them out of it for the time being,\u201d said Parvati. \u201cThat Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn\u2019t been anything since . . . Oh, hi, Hermione!\u201d\n\nParvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.\n\n\u201cHi, Parvati!\u201d said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. \u201cAre you going to Slughorn\u2019s party tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo invite,\u201d said Parvati gloomily. \u201cI\u2019d love to go, though, it sounds like it\u2019s going to be really good. . . . You\u2019re going, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m meeting Cormac at eight, and we\u2019re \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything.\n\n\u201c\u2014 we\u2019re going up to the party together.\u201d\n\n\u201cCormac?\u201d said Parvati. \u201cCormac McLaggen, you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Hermione sweetly. \u201cThe one who almost\u201d \u2014 she put a great deal of emphasis on the word \u2014 \u201cbecame Gryffindor Keeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going out with him, then?\u201d asked Parvati, wide-eyed.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 yes \u2014 didn\u2019t you know?\u201d said Hermione, with a most un-Hermione-ish giggle.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece of gossip. \u201cWow, you like your Quidditch players, don\u2019t you? First Krum, then McLaggen . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI like really good Quidditch players,\u201d Hermione corrected her, still smiling. \u201cWell, see you . . . Got to go and get ready for the party. . . .\u201d\n\nShe left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.\n\nWhen he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o\u2019clock that night, he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and her Spectrespecs.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said. \u201cShall we get going then?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said happily. \u201cWhere is the party?\u201d\n\n\u201cSlughorn\u2019s office,\u201d said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. \u201cDid you hear, there\u2019s supposed to be a vampire coming?\u201d\n\n\u201cRufus Scrimgeour?\u201d asked Luna.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 what?\u201d said Harry, disconcerted. \u201cYou mean the Minister of Magic?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s a vampire,\u201d said Luna matter-of-factly. \u201cFather wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn\u2019t want the truth to get out!\u201d\n\nHarry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father\u2019s bizarre views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn\u2019s office and the sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took.\n\nWhether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn\u2019s office was much larger than the usual teacher\u2019s study. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables.\n\n\u201cHarry, m\u2019boy!\u201d boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door. \u201cCome in, come in, so many people I\u2019d like you to meet!\u201d\n\nSlughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket. Gripping Harry\u2019s arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna\u2019s hand and dragged her along with him.\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires \u2014 and, of course, his friend Sanguini.\u201d\n\nWorple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed Harry\u2019s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini, who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes, merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was standing close to him, looking curious and excited.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, I am simply delighted!\u201d said Worple, peering shortsightedly up into Harry\u2019s face. \u201cI was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day, \u2018Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry, \u201cwere you?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as modest as Horace described!\u201d said Worple. \u201cBut seriously\u201d \u2014 his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike \u2014 \u201cI would be delighted to write it myself \u2014 people are craving to know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why, we could have the book finished within months. And all with very little effort on your part, I assure you \u2014 ask Sanguini here if it isn\u2019t quite \u2014 Sanguini, stay here!\u201d added Worple, suddenly stern, for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a rather hungry look in his eye. \u201cHere, have a pasty,\u201d said Worple, seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini\u2019s hand before turning his attention back to Harry.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not interested,\u201d said Harry firmly, \u201cand I\u2019ve just seen a friend of mine, sorry.\u201d\n\nHe pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters.\n\n\u201cHermione! Hermione!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you?\u201d asked Harry, for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devil\u2019s Snare.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve just escaped \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve just left Cormac,\u201d she said. \u201cUnder the mistletoe,\u201d she added in explanation, as Harry continued to look questioningly at her.\n\n\u201cServes you right for coming with him,\u201d he told her severely.\n\n\u201cI thought he\u2019d annoy Ron most,\u201d said Hermione dispassionately. \u201cI debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought, on the whole \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou considered Smith?\u201d said Harry, revolted.\n\n\u201cYes, I did, and I\u2019m starting to wish I\u2019d chosen him, McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let\u2019s go this way, we\u2019ll be able to see him coming, he\u2019s so tall. . . .\u201d\n\nThe three of them made their way over to the other side of the room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney.\n\n\u201cGood evening, my dear,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, focusing upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry again. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in my classes lately. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got Firenze this year,\u201d said Luna.\n\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d said Professor Trelawney with an angry, drunken titter. \u201cOr Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no . . . we share classes. . . . It\u2019s an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you know . . .\u201d\n\nProfessor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry. Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer to Hermione and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?\u201d\n\nHermione raised her eyebrows. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019d stoop that low?\u201d\n\nHarry looked at her shrewdly. \u201cHermione, if you can ask out McLaggen \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference,\u201d said Hermione with dignity. \u201cI\u2019ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Harry fervently. \u201cBecause he\u2019ll just fall apart again, and we\u2019ll lose the next match \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cQuidditch!\u201d said Hermione angrily. \u201cIs that all boys care about? Cormac hasn\u2019t asked me one single question about myself, no, I\u2019ve just been treated to \u2018A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen\u2019 nonstop ever since \u2014 oh no, here he comes!\u201d\n\nShe moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished.\n\n\u201cSeen Hermione?\u201d asked McLaggen, forcing his way through the throng a minute later.\n\n\u201cNo, sorry,\u201d said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna\u2019s conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones, noticing him for the first time.\n\n\u201cOh, hello,\u201d said Harry unenthusiastically.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy!\u201d she said in a very carrying whisper. \u201cThe rumors! The stories! \u2018The Chosen One\u2019! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Sybill, we all think our subject\u2019s most important!\u201d said a loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney\u2019s other side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever known such a natural at Potions!\u201d said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. \u201cInstinctive, you know \u2014 like his mother! I\u2019ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill \u2014 why even Severus \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd to Harry\u2019s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them.\n\n\u201cStop skulking and come and join us, Severus!\u201d hiccuped Slughorn happily. \u201cI was just talking about Harry\u2019s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught him for five years!\u201d\n\nTrapped, with Slughorn\u2019s arm around his shoulders, Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed.\n\n\u201cFunny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, it\u2019s natural ability!\u201d shouted Slughorn. \u201cYou should have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death \u2014 never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don\u2019t think even you, Severus \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.\n\n\u201cRemind me what other subjects you\u2019re taking, Harry?\u201d asked Slughorn.\n\n\u201cDefense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,\u201d said Snape, with the faintest sneer.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do,\u201d said Harry defiantly.\n\n\u201cAnd a great one you\u2019ll make too!\u201d boomed Slughorn.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be an Auror, Harry,\u201d said Luna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. \u201cThe Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They\u2019re working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease.\u201d\n\nHarry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh. Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.\n\n\u201cProfessor Slughorn,\u201d wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, \u201cI discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out. Did you issue him with an invitation?\u201d\n\nMalfoy pulled himself free of Filch\u2019s grip, looking furious.\n\n\u201cAll right, I wasn\u2019t invited!\u201d he said angrily. \u201cI was trying to gate-crash, happy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble, you are! Didn\u2019t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling\u2019s out, unless you\u2019ve got permission, didn\u2019t he, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Argus, that\u2019s all right,\u201d said Slughorn, waving a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas, and it\u2019s not a crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, we\u2019ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.\u201d\n\nFilch\u2019s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and . . . was it possible? . . . a little afraid?\n\nBut almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity, and Snape\u2019s face was smoothly inscrutable again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, nothing,\u201d said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy\u2019s thanks. \u201cI did know your grandfather, after all. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always spoke very highly of you, sir,\u201d said Malfoy quickly. \u201cSaid you were the best potion-maker he\u2019d ever known. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like a word with you, Draco,\u201d said Snape suddenly.\n\n\u201cOh, now, Severus,\u201d said Slughorn, hiccuping again, \u201cit\u2019s Christmas, don\u2019t be too hard \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,\u201d said Snape curtly. \u201cFollow me, Draco.\u201d\n\nThey left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful. Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a bit, Luna \u2014 er \u2014 bathroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested.\n\nIt was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn\u2019s office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons . . . or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement, he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.\n\n\u201c. . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to do with it, all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho suspects me?\u201d said Malfoy angrily. \u201cFor the last time, I didn\u2019t do it, okay? That Bell girl must\u2019ve had an enemy no one knows about \u2014 don\u2019t look at me like that! I know what you\u2019re doing, I\u2019m not stupid, but it won\u2019t work \u2014 I can stop you!\u201d\n\nThere was a pause and then Snape said quietly, \u201cAh . . . Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don\u2019t want you butting in!\u201d\n\nHarry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . . What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this \u2014 Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?\n\n\u201cSo that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!\u201d jeered Malfoy.\n\nThere was another pause. Then Snape said, \u201cYou know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better stop telling me to come to your office then!\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to me,\u201d said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. \u201cI am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll have to break it, then, because I don\u2019t need your protection! It\u2019s my job, he gave it to me and I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019ve got a plan and it\u2019s going to work, it\u2019s just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I\u2019m not alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these are elementary mistakes \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn\u2019t put them in detention!\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down!\u201d spat Snape, for Malfoy\u2019s voice had risen excitedly. \u201cIf your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around, they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cDefense Against the Dark Arts \u2014 it\u2019s all just a joke, isn\u2019t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!\u201d said Snape. \u201cWhere do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the only ones, I\u2019ve got other people on my side, better people!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why not confide in me, and I can \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re up to! You want to steal my glory!\u201d\n\nThere was another pause, then Snape said coldly, \u201cYou are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your father\u2019s capture and imprisonment has upset you, but \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry had barely a second\u2019s warning; he heard Malfoy\u2019s footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open; Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past the open door of Slughorn\u2019s office, around the distant corner, and out of sight.\n\nHardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the Cloak, his mind racing."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter16": "A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS\n\n\n\n\nSo Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask that once more,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019m going to stick this sprout \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only checking!\u201d said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow\u2019s kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.\n\n\u201cYes, Snape was offering to help him!\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe said he\u2019d promised Malfoy\u2019s mother to protect him, that he\u2019d made an Unbreakable Oath or something \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Unbreakable Vow?\u201d said Ron, looking stunned. \u201cNah, he can\u2019t have. . . . Are you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy, what does it mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou die,\u201d said Ron simply. \u201cFred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,\u201d said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. \u201cOnly time I\u2019ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, passing over Fred\u2019s left buttock \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d said Fred\u2019s voice as the twins entered the kitchen.\n\n\u201cAaah, George, look at this. They\u2019re using knives and everything. Bless them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be seventeen in two and a bit months\u2019 time,\u201d said Ron grumpily, \u201cand then I\u2019ll be able to do it by magic!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut meanwhile,\u201d said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, \u201cwe can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a \u2014 whoops-a-daisy!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made me do that!\u201d said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. \u201cYou wait, when I\u2019m seventeen \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,\u201d yawned Fred.\n\n\u201cAnd speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,\u201d said George, \u201cwhat is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called \u2014 unless our information is faulty \u2014 Lavender Brown?\u201d\n\nRon turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. \u201cMind your own business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a snappy retort,\u201d said Fred. \u201cI really don\u2019t know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was . . . how did it happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid she have an accident or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand.\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d she said furiously. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever let me see you throwing knives again!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said Ron, \u201clet you see,\u201d he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.\n\n\u201cFred, George, I\u2019m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cThen, as Charlie isn\u2019t coming home, that just leaves Harry and Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 that\u2019ll make Ginny\u2019s Christmas \u2014\u201d muttered Fred.\n\n\u201c\u2014 everyone should be comfortable. Well, they\u2019ll have a bed, anyway,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.\n\n\u201cPercy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?\u201d asked Fred.\n\nMrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. \u201cNo, he\u2019s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr he\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest prat,\u201d said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. \u201cOne of the two. Well, let\u2019s get going, then, George.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d asked Ron. \u201cCan\u2019t you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we\u2019ll be free too!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think we can do that,\u201d said Fred seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and if you want people to help you, Ron,\u201d added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We\u2019re off to the village, there\u2019s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous . . . almost like real magic. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGits,\u201d said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. \u201cWould\u2019ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could\u2019ve gone too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI promised Dumbledore I wouldn\u2019t wander off while I\u2019m staying here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, \u201cAre you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore\u2019s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.\u201d\n\n\u201cPity you didn\u2019t hear what Malfoy\u2019s actually doing, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.\u201d\n\nThere was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, \u201c\u2019Course, you know what they\u2019ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They\u2019ll say Snape isn\u2019t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy\u2019s up to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t hear him,\u201d said Harry flatly. \u201cNo one\u2019s that good an actor, not even Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . I\u2019m just saying, though,\u201d said Ron.\n\nHarry turned to face him, frowning. \u201cYou think I\u2019m right, though?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I do!\u201d said Ron hastily. \u201cSeriously, I do! But they\u2019re all convinced Snape\u2019s in the Order, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he\u2019s doing. . . .\n\nThis was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn\u2019s party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time.\n\nStill, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \u201cI told you so,\u201d which he had done several times to Ron already.\n\nHarry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.\n\nThey were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasley\u2019s favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called \u201cA Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\u201d Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestina\u2019s voice.\n\nOh, come and stir my cauldron,\n\nAnd if you do it right,\n\nI\u2019ll boil you up some hot strong love\n\nTo keep you warm tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe danced to this when we were eighteen!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. \u201cDo you remember, Arthur?\u201d\n\n\u201cMphf?\u201d said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. \u201cOh yes . . . marvelous tune . . .\u201d\n\nWith an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him.\n\n\u201cSorry about this,\u201d he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. \u201cBe over soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Harry, grinning. \u201cHas it been busy at the Ministry?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we\u2019ve made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater \u2014 only don\u2019t repeat that, Harry,\u201d he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cI know Dumbledore\u2019s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. . . . I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he\u2019s about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they\u2019re making some progress, and \u2018three arrests\u2019 sounds better than \u2018three mistaken arrests and releases\u2019 . . . but again, this is all top secret. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say anything,\u201d said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called \u201cYou Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?\u201d\n\n\u201cI checked, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley at once. \u201cI went and searched the Malfoys\u2019 house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn\u2019t have been there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you\u2019d looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin\u2019s head turn a little toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina\u2019s crooning.\n\nOh, my poor heart, where has it gone?\n\nIt\u2019s left me for a spell . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHas it occurred to you, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, \u201cthat Snape was simply pretending \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cPretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy\u2019s up to?\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cYeah, I thought you\u2019d say that. But how do we know?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t our business to know,\u201d said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. \u201cIt\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Harry, \u201cjust say \u2014 just say Dumbledore\u2019s wrong about Snape \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore\u2019s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Dumbledore can make mistakes,\u201d argued Harry. \u201cHe says it himself. And you\u201d \u2014 he looked Lupin straight in the eye \u2014 \u201cdo you honestly like Snape?\u201d\n\n\u201cI neither like nor dislike Severus,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cNo, Harry, I am speaking the truth,\u201d he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expression. \u201cWe shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he \u2018accidentally\u2019 let it slip that you\u2019re a werewolf, so you had to leave!\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\nLupin shrugged. \u201cThe news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou are determined to hate him, Harry,\u201d said Lupin with a faint smile. \u201cAnd I understand; with James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledore\u2019s orders that Severus questioned Draco.\u201d\n\n. . . and now you\u2019ve torn it quite apart\n\nI\u2019ll thank you to give back my heart!\n\n\n\n\n\nCelestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cEez eet over?\u201d said Fleur loudly. \u201cThank goodness, what an \u2019orrible \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we have a nightcap, then?\u201d asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. \u201cWho wants eggnog?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you been up to lately?\u201d Harry asked Lupin, as Mr. Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve been underground,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cAlmost literally. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living among my fellows, my equals,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cWerewolves,\u201d he added, at Harry\u2019s look of incomprehension. \u201cNearly all of them are on Voldemort\u2019s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made.\u201d\n\nHe sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \u201cI am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing \u2014 and sometimes killing \u2014 to eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come they like Voldemort?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cAnd it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Greyback?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard of him?\u201d Lupin\u2019s hands closed convulsively in his lap. \u201cFenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people\u2019s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\u201d\n\nLupin paused and then said, \u201cIt was Greyback who bit me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, astonished. \u201cWhen \u2014 when you were a kid, you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback\u2019s insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you are normal!\u201d said Harry fiercely. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got a \u2014 a problem \u2014\u201d\n\nLupin burst out laughing. \u201cSometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my \u2018furry little problem\u2019 in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.\u201d\n\nHe accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin.\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Half-Blood what?\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince,\u201d said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.\n\n\u201cThere are no Wizarding princes,\u201d said Lupin, now smiling. \u201cIs this a title you\u2019re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being \u2018the Chosen One\u2019 would be enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with me!\u201d said Harry indignantly. \u201cThe Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I\u2019ve got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\u201d said Lupin reminiscently. \u201cThere were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn\u2019t move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dad used it,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.\u201d\n\nHe tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin\u2019s smile was a little too understanding.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he wasn\u2019t the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,\u201d Harry persisted.\n\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cJinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.\u201d\n\nHe looked into Harry\u2019s face and then said quietly, \u201cJames was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him \u2018Prince.\u2019\u201d\n\nAbandoning pretense, Harry said, \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t Sirius? Or you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Harry stared into the fire. \u201cI just thought \u2014 well, he\u2019s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow old is this book, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, I\u2019ve never checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,\u201d said Lupin.\n\nShortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing \u201cA Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\u201d which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley\u2019s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron\u2019s attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.\n\nRon fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father\u2019s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got to be joking. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from Lavender,\u201d said Ron, sounding revolted. \u201cShe can\u2019t honestly think I\u2019d wear . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:\n\nMy Sweetheart\n\n\n\n\u201cNice,\u201d he said. \u201cClassy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you tell them,\u201d said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \u201cI \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019ll \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStutter at me?\u201d said Harry, grinning. \u201cCome on, would I?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could she think I\u2019d like something like that, though?\u201d Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.\n\n\u201cWell, think back,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHave you ever let it slip that you\u2019d like to go out in public with the words \u2018My Sweetheart\u2019 round your neck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . we don\u2019t really talk much,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSnogging,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, \u201cIs Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey were at Slughorn\u2019s party together, but I don\u2019t think it went that well.\u201d\n\nRon looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.\n\nHarry\u2019s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading TO MASTER, FROM KREACHER.\n\nHarry stared at it. \u201cD\u2019you reckon this is safe to open?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be anything dangerous, all our mail\u2019s still being searched at the Ministry,\u201d replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?\u201d asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.\n\n\u201cHermione would,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut let\u2019s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.\u201d\n\nA moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.\n\n\u201cNice,\u201d said Ron, roaring with laughter. \u201cVery thoughtful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have them than that necklace,\u201d said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.\n\nEverybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch\u2019s hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace.\n\n\u201cFred and George gave them to me! Aren\u2019t they beautiful?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we\u2019re washing our own socks,\u201d said George, waving an airy hand. \u201cParsnips, Remus?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019ve got a maggot in your hair,\u201d said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.\n\n\u201c\u2019Ow \u2019orrible,\u201d said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.\n\n\u201cYes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cGravy, Fleur?\u201d\n\nIn his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.\n\n\u201cYou are as bad as zat Tonks,\u201d said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \u201cShe is always knocking \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI invited dear Tonks to come along today,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. \u201cBut she wouldn\u2019t come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t been in contact with anybody very much,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cBut Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cMaybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.\u201d\n\nShe gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?\n\n\u201cTonks\u2019s Patronus has changed its form,\u201d he told him. \u201cSnape said so anyway. I didn\u2019t know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?\u201d\n\nLupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \u201cSometimes . . . a great shock . . . an emotional upheaval . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looked big, and it had four legs,\u201d said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. \u201cHey . . . it couldn\u2019t be \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. \u201cArthur \u2014 it\u2019s Percy!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.\n\n\u201cArthur, he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s with the Minister!\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy\u2019s wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy.\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, \u201cMerry Christmas, Mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Percy!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.\n\nRufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.\n\n\u201cYou must forgive this intrusion,\u201d he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. \u201cPercy and I were in the vicinity \u2014 working, you know \u2014 and he couldn\u2019t resist dropping in and seeing you all.\u201d\n\nBut Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else\u2019s heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced.\n\n\u201cPlease, come in, sit down, Minister!\u201d fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. \u201cHave a little purkey, or some tooding. . . . I mean \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, my dear Molly,\u201d said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. \u201cI don\u2019t want to intrude, wouldn\u2019t be here at all if Percy hadn\u2019t wanted to see you all so badly. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Perce!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.\n\n\u201c. . . We\u2019ve only looked in for five minutes, so I\u2019ll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don\u2019t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man\u2019s finished, why doesn\u2019t he take a stroll with me?\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour\u2019s pretense that he did not know Harry\u2019s name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.\n\n\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d said Harry into the silence.\n\nHe was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour\u2019s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. \u201cFine,\u201d he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.\n\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass through the door ahead of him. \u201cWe\u2019ll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I\u2019ll be off. Carry on, everyone!\u201d\n\nHarry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys\u2019 overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.\n\n\u201cCharming,\u201d said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. \u201cCharming.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,\u201d said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. \u201cDid you know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry truthfully.\n\n\u201cOh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cNatural, of course, natural, after what you\u2019ve been through. . . . Especially what happened at the Ministry . . .\u201d\n\nHe waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, so he went on, \u201cI have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has \u2014 most understandably, as I say \u2014 prevented this.\u201d\n\nStill, Harry said nothing, waiting.\n\n\u201cThe rumors that have flown around!\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cWell, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted . . . all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being \u2018the Chosen One\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nThey were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here.\n\n\u201c. . . I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?\u201d\n\nHarry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, and the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth . . . or a bit of it.\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve discussed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you, have you . . .\u201d said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. \u201cAnd what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, but that\u2019s between us,\u201d said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour\u2019s tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, \u201cOh, of course, if it\u2019s a question of confidences, I wouldn\u2019t want you to divulge . . . no, no . . . and in any case, does it really matter whether you are \u2018the Chosen One\u2019 or not?\u201d\n\nHarry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what you mean, Minister.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course, to you it will matter enormously,\u201d said Scrimgeour with a laugh. \u201cBut to the Wizarding community at large . . . it\u2019s all perception, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s what people believe that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.\n\n\u201cPeople believe you are \u2018the Chosen One,\u2019 you see,\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cThey think you quite the hero \u2014 which, of course, you are, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,\u201d he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, \u201cthe point is, you are a symbol of hope for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named \u2014 well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can\u2019t help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.\u201d\n\nThe gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, \u201cFunny little chaps, aren\u2019t they? But what say you, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t exactly understand what you want,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201c\u2018Stand alongside the Ministry\u2019 . . . What does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cIf you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impression. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?\n\n\u201cSo basically,\u201d he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, \u201cyou\u2019d like to give the impression that I\u2019m working for the Ministry?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,\u201d said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. \u201c\u2018The Chosen One,\u2019 you know . . . It\u2019s all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,\u201d said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, \u201cwon\u2019t that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry\u2019s up to?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, \u201cwell, yes, that\u2019s partly why we\u2019d like \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll work,\u201d said Harry pleasantly. \u201cYou see, I don\u2019t like some of the things the Ministry\u2019s doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.\u201d\n\nScrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly. \u201cI would not expect you to understand,\u201d he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. \u201cThese are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn\u2019t think Stan should be in Azkaban either,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou\u2019re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, \u201cI see. You prefer \u2014 like your hero, Dumbledore \u2014 to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be used,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cSome would say it\u2019s your duty to be used by the Ministry!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and others might say it\u2019s your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,\u201d said Harry, his temper rising now. \u201cYou\u2019re doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we\u2019ve got Fudge, pretending everything\u2019s lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we\u2019ve got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you\u2019ve got \u2018the Chosen One\u2019 working for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not \u2018the Chosen One\u2019?\u201d said Scrimgeour.\n\n\u201cI thought you said it didn\u2019t matter either way?\u201d said Harry, with a bitter laugh. \u201cNot to you anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that,\u201d said Scrimgeour quickly. \u201cIt was tactless \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it was honest,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOne of the only honest things you\u2019ve said to me. You don\u2019t care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you\u2019re winning the war against Voldemort. I haven\u2019t forgotten, Minister. . . .\u201d\n\nHe raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn\u2019t so keen to be pals last year.\u201d\n\nThey stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush.\n\n\u201cWhat is Dumbledore up to?\u201d said Scrimgeour brusquely. \u201cWhere does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t tell me if you knew,\u201d said Scrimgeour, \u201cwould you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, then, I shall have to see whether I can\u2019t find out by other means.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can try,\u201d said Harry indifferently. \u201cBut you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I\u2019d have thought you\u2019d have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he\u2019s not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore\u2019s still headmaster. I\u2019d leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause.\n\n\u201cWell, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,\u201d said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s man through and through, aren\u2019t you, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d said Harry. \u201cGlad we straightened that out.\u201d\n\nAnd turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter17": "A SLUGGISH MEMORY\n\n\n\n\nLate in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit).\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Mum,\u201d said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry about us,\u201d said Ron, permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, \u201cor about Percy. He\u2019s such a prat, it\u2019s not really a loss, is it?\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms.\n\n\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll look after yourself. . . . Stay out of trouble. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI always do, Mrs. Weasley,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI like a quiet life, you know me.\u201d\n\nShe gave a watery chuckle and stood back. \u201cBe good, then, all of you. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted \u201cHogwarts!\u201d He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys\u2019 kitchen and Mrs. Weasley\u2019s tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagall\u2019s office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate.\n\n\u201cEvening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Professor.\u201d\n\nHarry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall\u2019s office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.\n\n\u201cBaubles,\u201d said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, \u2018no\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a new password,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t shout.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve been away, how\u2019re we supposed to \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! Ginny!\u201d\n\nHermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves.\n\n\u201cI got back a couple of hours ago, I\u2019ve just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck \u2014 I mean Witherwings,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cDid you have a good Christmas?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron at once, \u201cpretty eventful, Rufus Scrim \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got something for you, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. \u201cOh, hang on \u2014 password. Abstinence.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with her?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cOverindulged over Christmas, apparently,\u201d said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room. \u201cShe and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor. Anyway . . .\u201d\n\nShe rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore\u2019s writing on it.\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. \u201cI\u2019ve got loads to tell him \u2014 and you. Let\u2019s sit down \u2014\u201d\n\nBut at that moment there was a loud squeal of \u201cWon-Won!\u201d and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ron\u2019s arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a table over here. . . . Coming, Ginny?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks, I said I\u2019d meet Dean,\u201d said Ginny, though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic. Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table.\n\n\u201cSo how was your Christmas?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, fine,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cNothing special. How was it at Won-Won\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in a minute,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLook, Hermione, can\u2019t you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cSo don\u2019t even ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought maybe, you know, over Christmas \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted to tell me?\u201d\n\nShe looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he\u2019s doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cRon\u2019s dad and Lupin think so,\u201d Harry said grudgingly. \u201cBut this definitely proves Malfoy\u2019s planning something, you can\u2019t deny that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d she answered slowly.\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s acting on Voldemort\u2019s orders, just like I said!\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm . . . did either of them actually mention Voldemort\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nHarry frowned, trying to remember. \u201cI\u2019m not sure . . . Snape definitely said \u2018your master,\u2019 and who else would that be?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hermione, biting her lip. \u201cMaybe his father?\u201d\n\nShe stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron. \u201cHow\u2019s Lupin?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot great,\u201d said Harry, and he told her all about Lupin\u2019s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. \u201cHave you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I have!\u201d said Hermione, sounding startled. \u201cAnd so have you, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, not History of Magic \u2014 Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBack in Knockturn Alley, don\u2019t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he\u2019d be checking up on Borgin\u2019s progress!\u201d\n\nHarry gaped at her. \u201cI forgot! But this proves Malfoy\u2019s a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is pretty suspicious,\u201d breathed Hermione. \u201cUnless . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d said Harry in exasperation, \u201cyou can\u2019t get round this one!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable, you are,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who\u2019s right. . . . You\u2019ll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now.\n\nThe new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight.\n\nAPPARITION LESSONS\n\nIf you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a twelve-week course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor. Please sign below if you would like to participate. Cost: 12 Galleons.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom. Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and trilled, \u201cGuess who, Won-Won?\u201d Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville.\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 Apparition,\u201d said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had just happened. \u201cShould be a laugh, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better when you do it yourself, I didn\u2019t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride.\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgot you\u2019d already done it. . . . I\u2019d better pass my test first time,\u201d said Ron, looking anxious. \u201cFred and George did.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlie failed, though, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but Charlie\u2019s bigger than me\u201d \u2014 Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla \u2014 \u201cso Fred and George didn\u2019t go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen can we take the actual test?\u201d\n\n\u201cSoon as we\u2019re seventeen. That\u2019s only March for me!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to Apparate in here, not in the castle . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted.\u201d\n\nRon was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will.\n\n\u201cHow cool will it be when we can just \u2014\u201d Seamus clicked his fingers to indicate disappearance. \u201cMe cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me, you wait till I can do it back . . . He\u2019ll never have another peaceful moment. . . .\u201d\n\nLost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today\u2019s Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s already Apparated,\u201d Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines: \u201cI am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.\u201d \u201cDum \u2014 er \u2014 someone took him. Side-Along-Apparition, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore.\n\nThe lamps in Dumbledore\u2019s office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pensieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledore\u2019s hands lay on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt-looking as ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered, for perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted to discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke.\n\n\u201cI hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s not very happy with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d sighed Dumbledore. \u201cHe is not very happy with me either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but battle on.\u201d\n\nHarry grinned.\n\n\u201cHe wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry\u2019s doing a wonderful job.\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled.\n\n\u201cIt was Fudge\u2019s idea originally, you know. During his last days in office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your support \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter everything Fudge did last year?\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cAfter Umbridge?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not die when he left office. Within hours of Scrimgeour\u2019s appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why you argued!\u201d Harry blurted out. \u201cIt was in the Daily Prophet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cif only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued. Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe accused me of being \u2018Dumbledore\u2019s man through and through.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHow very rude of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told him I was.\u201d\n\nDumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry\u2019s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that Dumbledore\u2019s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.\n\n\u201cI am very touched, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cScrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you\u2019re not at Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees.\n\n\u201cYes, he is very nosy about that,\u201d said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. \u201cHe has even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set Dawlish to tail me. It wasn\u2019t kind. I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they still don\u2019t know where you go?\u201d asked Harry, hoping for more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles.\n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t, and the time is not quite right for you to know either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless there\u2019s anything else \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is, actually, sir,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s about Malfoy and Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorn\u2019s party . . . well, I followed them, actually. . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore listened to Harry\u2019s story with an impassive face. When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments, then said, \u201cThank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot of great importance?\u201d repeated Harry incredulously. \u201cProfessor, did you understand \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,\u201d said Dumbledore, a little sharply. \u201cI think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.\u201d\n\nHarry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not to be?\n\n\u201cSo, sir,\u201d said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice, \u201cyou definitely still trust \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,\u201d said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore. \u201cMy answer has not changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should think not,\u201d said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him.\n\n\u201cAnd now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.\u201d\n\nHarry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry\u2019s mind, Dumbledore shook his head.\n\n\u201cAh, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think what you\u2019ve got to say is unimportant, sir,\u201d said Harry stiffly.\n\n\u201cWell, you are quite right, because it is not,\u201d said Dumbledore briskly. \u201cI have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, I think, the most important I have collected.\u201d\n\nHarry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, \u201cwe meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.\n\n\u201cWell, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,\u201d continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. \u201cHow soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes, I do not know \u2014 perhaps that very evening. The knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of self-importance.\n\n\u201cHowever, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed polite, quiet, and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell them, sir, what he\u2019d been like when you met him at the orphanage?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cNo, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.\u201d\n\nDumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledore\u2019s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something. . . .\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the Riddle who came out of that diary said, \u2018Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues.\n\n\u201cAs he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term, although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory, and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cRigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime.\n\n\u201cI have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,\u201d said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. \u201cFew who knew him then are prepared to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.\n\n\u201cThose whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his previously despised mother\u2019s family \u2014 the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death.\n\n\u201cAll he had to go upon was the single name \u2018Marvolo,\u2019 which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother\u2019s father\u2019s name. Finally, after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin\u2019s surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.\n\n\u201cI was very lucky to collect this,\u201d he said, as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve. \u201cAs you will understand when we have experienced it. Shall we?\u201d\n\nHarry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.\n\nIt took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts\u2019 house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left.\n\nThe door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale, dark-haired, and handsome \u2014 the teenage Voldemort.\n\nVoldemort\u2019s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor.\n\n\u201cYOU!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cYOU!\u201d\n\nAnd he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft.\n\n\u201cStop.\u201d\n\nRiddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table, sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle. There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The man broke it.\n\n\u201cYou speak it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I speak it,\u201d said Riddle. He moved forward into the room, allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort\u2019s complete lack of fear. His face merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.\n\n\u201cWhere is Marvolo?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cDead,\u201d said the other. \u201cDied years ago, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nRiddle frowned.\n\n\u201cWho are you, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Morfin, ain\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cMarvolo\u2019s son?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course I am, then . . .\u201d\n\nMorfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo\u2019s black-stoned ring on his right hand.\n\n\u201cI thought you was that Muggle,\u201d whispered Morfin. \u201cYou look mighty like that Muggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Muggle?\u201d said Riddle sharply.\n\n\u201cThat Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way,\u201d said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them. \u201cYou look right like him. Riddle. But he\u2019s older now, in \u2019e? He\u2019s older\u2019n you, now I think on it. . . .\u201d\n\nMorfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching the edge of the table for support. \u201cHe come back, see,\u201d he added stupidly.\n\nVoldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, \u201cRiddle came back?\u201d\n\n\u201cAr, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!\u201d said Morfin, spitting on the floor again. \u201cRobbed us, mind, before she ran off! Where\u2019s the locket, eh, where\u2019s Slytherin\u2019s locket?\u201d\n\nVoldemort did not answer. Morfin was working himself into a rage again; he brandished his knife and shouted, \u201cDishonored us, she did, that little slut! And who\u2019re you, coming here and asking questions about all that? It\u2019s over, innit. . . . It\u2019s over. . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort\u2019s lamp and Morfin\u2019s candle, extinguishing everything. . . .\n\nDumbledore\u2019s fingers closed tightly around Harry\u2019s arm and they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light in Dumbledore\u2019s office seemed to dazzle Harry\u2019s eyes after that impenetrable darkness.\n\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cWhy did it go dark, what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward,\u201d said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat. \u201cWhen he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite alone. Marvolo\u2019s ring had gone.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father.\n\n\u201cThe Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware, they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The exception sits before me,\u201d Dumbledore added, with a nod to Harry\u2019s scar. \u201cThe Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that this was a wizard\u2019s murder. They also knew that a convicted Muggle-hater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people.\n\n\u201cSo the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand, which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles. And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight. All that disturbed him was the fact that his father\u2019s ring had disappeared. \u2018He\u2019ll kill me for losing it,\u2019 he told his captors over and over again. \u2018He\u2019ll kill me for losing his ring.\u2019 And that, apparently, was all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo\u2019s last heirloom, and is buried beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Voldemort stole Morfin\u2019s wand and used it?\u201d said Harry, sitting up straight.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWe have no memories to show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened. Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to \u2018the big house over the way.\u2019 There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle\u2019s mind, laid Morfin\u2019s wand beside its unconscious owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Morfin never realized he hadn\u2019t done it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe gave, as I say, a full and boastful confession.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he had this real memory in him all the time!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cand why should anybody delve further into Morfin\u2019s mind when he had already confessed to the crime? However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort\u2019s past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure Morfin\u2019s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their decision, however, Morfin had died.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how come the Ministry didn\u2019t realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?\u201d Harry asked angrily. \u201cHe was underage at the time, wasn\u2019t he? I thought they could detect underage magic!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are quite right \u2014 they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby,\u201d growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. \u201cSo if you\u2019re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard\u2019s house, the Ministry won\u2019t know?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cThey rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring\u2019s obedience while within their walls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s rubbish,\u201d snapped Harry. \u201cLook what happened here, look what happened to Morfin!\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWhatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory before we part. . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?\n\n\u201cThis will not take long,\u201d said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied the phial. \u201cWe shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve, then . . .\u201d\n\nAnd Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once.\n\nIt was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple.\n\nHarry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn\u2019s office. Half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once. His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo\u2019s gold-and-black ring; he had already killed his father.\n\n\u201cSir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cTom, Tom, if I knew I couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by winking. \u201cI must say, I\u2019d like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\u201d\n\nRiddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.\n\n\u201cWhat with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn\u2019t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter \u2014 thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you\u2019re quite right, it is my favorite \u2014\u201d\n\nAs several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened. The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside him. Then Slughorn\u2019s voice rang out through the mist, unnaturally loudly, \u201cYou\u2019ll go wrong, boy, mark my words.\u201d\n\nThe fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Slughorn\u2019s desk chimed eleven o\u2019clock.\n\n\u201cGood gracious, is it that time already?\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cYou\u2019d better get going, boys, or we\u2019ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it\u2019s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\u201d\n\nSlughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.\n\n\u201cLook sharp, Tom,\u201d said Slughorn, turning around and finding him still present. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I wanted to ask you something.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk away, then, m\u2019boy, ask away. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?\u201d\n\nAnd it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn\u2019s voice boomed out again, just as it had done before.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn\u2019t tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don\u2019t let me catch you mentioning them again!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s that,\u201d said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry. \u201cTime to go.\u201d\n\nAnd Harry\u2019s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the rug in front of Dumbledore\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all there is?\u201d said Harry blankly.\n\nDumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer.\n\n\u201cAs you might have noticed,\u201d said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, \u201cthat memory has been tampered with.\u201d\n\n\u201cTampered with?\u201d repeated Harry, sitting back down too.\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cProfessor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why would he do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.\n\n\u201cAnd so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at him.\n\n\u201cBut surely, sir,\u201d he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, \u201cyou don\u2019t need me \u2014 you could use Legilimency . . . or Veritaserum. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.\n\n\u201cNo, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck . . . and good night.\u201d\n\nA little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet quickly. \u201cGood night, sir.\u201d\n\nAs he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say, \u201cI can\u2019t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect you to, Phineas,\u201d replied Dumbledore, and Fawkes gave another low, musical cry."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter18": "BIRTHDAY SURPRISES\n\n\n\n\nThe next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately, for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron\u2019s presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look.\n\nRon thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all.\n\n\u201cHe loves you,\u201d he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. \u201cWon\u2019t refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.\u201d\n\nHermione, however, took a gloomier view. \u201cHe must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn\u2019t get it out of him,\u201d she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted, snowy courtyard at break. \u201cHorcruxes . . . Horcruxes . . . I\u2019ve never even heard of them. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.\n\n\u201cThey must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it\u2019s going to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you\u2019ll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRon reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you\u2019d better do it,\u201d she said, flaring up at once. \u201cAfter all, when has Won-Won\u2019s judgment ever been faulty?\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, can\u2019t you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow.\n\nPotions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie, and ignored both Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you done?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione\u2019s haughty profile.\n\nBut before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room.\n\n\u201cSettle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott\u2019s Third Law . . . who can tell me \u2014 ? But Miss Granger can, of course!\u201d\n\nHermione recited at top speed: \u201cGolpalott\u2019s-Third-Law-states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separate-components.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely!\u201d beamed Slughorn. \u201cTen points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott\u2019s Third Law as true . . .\u201d\n\nHarry was going to have to take Slughorn\u2019s word for it that Golpalott\u2019s Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next either.\n\n\u201c. . . which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion\u2019s ingredients by Scarpin\u2019s Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that added component that will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements \u2014\u201d\n\nRon was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.\n\n\u201c. . . and so,\u201d finished Slughorn, \u201cI want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don\u2019t forget your protective gloves!\u201d\n\nHermione had left her stool and was halfway toward Slughorn\u2019s desk before the rest of the class had realized it was time to move, and by the time Harry, Ron, and Ernie returned to the table, she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the Prince won\u2019t be able to help you much with this, Harry,\u201d she said brightly as she straightened up. \u201cYou have to understand the principles involved this time. No shortcuts or cheats!\u201d\n\nAnnoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slughorn\u2019s desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his cauldron, and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced around at Ron, who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having copied everything Harry had done.\n\n\u201cYou sure the Prince hasn\u2019t got any tips?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry.\n\nHarry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott\u2019s Third Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a single illuminating note in the Prince\u2019s hand to explain what it meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry gloomily.\n\nHermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, \u201cSpecialis Revelio!\u201d over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.\n\nIt took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione\u2019s expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince\u2019s book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.\n\nAnd there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes:\n\nJust shove a bezoar down their throats.\n\n\n\nHarry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn\u2019t he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn\u2019t Snape mentioned them in their first-ever Potions lesson? \u201cA stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons.\u201d\n\nIt was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word BEZOARS.\n\nHe opened the box just as Slughorn called, \u201cTwo minutes left, everyone!\u201d Inside were half a dozen shriveled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one, put the box back in the cupboard, and hurried back to his cauldron.\n\n\u201cTime\u2019s . . . UP!\u201d called Slughorn genially. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see how you\u2019ve done! Blaise . . . what have you got for me?\u201d\n\nSlowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand.\n\nSlughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie\u2019s potion and passed on to Ron\u2019s with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron\u2019s cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.\n\n\u201cAnd you, Harry,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have you got to show me?\u201d\n\nHarry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.\n\nSlughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then he threw back his head and roared with laughter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got nerve, boy!\u201d he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. \u201cOh, you\u2019re like your mother. . . . Well, I can\u2019t fault you. . . . A bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions!\u201d\n\nHermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose, looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients, including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry.\n\n\u201cAnd you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?\u201d she asked through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!\u201d said Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. \u201cJust like his mother, she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it\u2019s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it. . . . Yes, Harry, yes, if you\u2019ve got a bezoar to hand, of course that would do the trick . . . although as they don\u2019t work on everything, and are pretty rare, it\u2019s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes. . . .\u201d\n\nThe only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something that looked like cat-sick over himself. Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.\n\n\u201cTime to pack up!\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cAnd an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!\u201d\n\nStill chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon.\n\nHarry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room.\n\n\u201cCome on, now, Harry, you\u2019ll be late for your next lesson,\u201d said Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon-skin briefcase.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, \u201cI wanted to ask you something.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk away, then, my dear boy, ask away. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?\u201d\n\nSlughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He licked his lips and said hoarsely, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You see \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore put you up to this,\u201d whispered Slughorn. His voice had changed completely. It was not genial anymore, but shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s shown you that \u2014 that memory. Well? Hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white face. \u201cOf course . . . well, if you\u2019ve seen that memory, Harry, you\u2019ll know that I don\u2019t know anything \u2014 anything\u201d \u2014 he repeated the word forcefully \u2014 \u201cabout Horcruxes.\u201d\n\nHe seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket, and marched to the dungeon door.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Harry desperately, \u201cI just thought there might be a bit more to the memory \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you?\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cThen you were wrong, weren\u2019t you? WRONG!\u201d\n\nHe bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another word, slammed the dungeon door behind him.\n\nNeither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly. Ron was resentful that Harry hadn\u2019t slipped him a bezoar too.\n\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve just looked stupid if we\u2019d both done it!\u201d said Harry irritably. \u201cLook, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn\u2019t I? Oh, will you get a grip!\u201d he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name.\n\nInfuriated by his failure and by Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s attitudes, Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack.\n\nWhen Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: Neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!\u201d she told him. \u201cNot a single one! I\u2019ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions \u2014 nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile \u2014 listen \u2014 \u2018Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction. . . .\u2019 I mean, why mention it then?\u201d she said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly wail. \u201cOh, shut up,\u201d she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag.\n\nThe snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth years\u2019 first Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds.\n\nWhen Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come down with Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared. Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and Sprout \u2014 the Heads of Houses \u2014 and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the Heads of Houses had called for quiet. \u201cMy name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy, be quiet and pay attention!\u201d barked Professor McGonagall.\n\nEverybody looked around. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly suspected that this was less because of Malfoy\u2019s rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his House.\n\n\u201c\u2014 by which time, many of you may be ready to take your tests,\u201d Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption.\n\n\u201cAs you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practice. May I emphasize that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.\n\n\u201cI would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you.\u201d\n\nThere was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated, banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The Heads of Houses moved among the students, marshaling them into position and breaking up arguments.\n\n\u201cHarry, where are you going?\u201d demanded Hermione.\n\nBut Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and looking mutinous.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer, all right?\u201d Malfoy shot at him, oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s taking longer than I thought it would.\u201d\n\nCrabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess what he was going to say. \u201cLook, it\u2019s none of your business what I\u2019m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you\u2019re told and keep a lookout!\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell my friends what I\u2019m up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,\u201d Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him.\n\nMalfoy spun around on the spot, his hand flying to his wand, but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted, \u201cQuiet!\u201d and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the front again.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Twycross. \u201cNow then . . .\u201d\n\nHe waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student.\n\n\u201cThe important things to remember when Apparating are the three D\u2019s!\u201d said Twycross. \u201cDestination, Determination, Deliberation!\n\n\u201cStep one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,\u201d said Twycross. \u201cIn this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.\u201d\n\nEverybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told. Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn\u2019t stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts.\n\n\u201cStep two,\u201d said Twycross, \u201cfocus your determination to occupy the visualized space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body!\u201d\n\nHarry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left, Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop.\n\n\u201cStep three,\u201d called Twycross, \u201cand only when I give the command . . . Turn on the spot, feeling your way into nothingness, moving with deliberation! On my command, now . . . one \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly.\n\n\u201c\u2014 two \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already forgotten what the three D\u2019s stood for.\n\n\u201c\u2014 THREE!\u201d\n\nHarry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell over. He was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him.\n\n\u201cNever mind, never mind,\u201d said Twycross dryly, who did not seem to have expected anything better. \u201cAdjust your hoops, please, and back to your original positions. . . .\u201d\n\nThe second attempt was no better than the first. The third was just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen. There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around, terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started.\n\nThe Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing, reunited with her leg but looking horrified.\n\n\u201cSplinching, or the separation of random body parts,\u201d said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, \u201coccurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continuously upon your destination, and move, without haste, but with deliberation . . . thus.\u201d\n\nTwycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched, and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at the back of the Hall.\n\n\u201cRemember the three D\u2019s,\u201d he said, \u201cand try again . . . one \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014\u201d\n\nBut an hour later, Susan\u2019s Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged. Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, \u201cUntil next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destination. Determination. Deliberation.\u201d\n\nWith that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall.\n\n\u201cHow did you do?\u201d asked Ron, hurrying toward Harry. \u201cI think I felt something the last time I tried \u2014 a kind of tingling in my feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,\u201d said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything,\u201d said Harry, ignoring this interruption. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care about that now \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, you don\u2019t care? Don\u2019t you want to learn to Apparate?\u201d said Ron incredulously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,\u201d said Harry, glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall. \u201cLook, hurry up, will you, there\u2019s something I want to do. . . .\u201d\n\nPerplexed, Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor Tower at a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts. Within five minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.\n\n\u201cAre you going to tell me what we\u2019re doing, then?\u201d asked Ron, panting slightly.\n\n\u201cUp here,\u201d said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys\u2019 staircase.\n\nTheir dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched impatiently.\n\n\u201cHarry . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy\u2019s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with Crabbe just now. I want to know \u2014 aha.\u201d\n\nHe had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment, which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand.\n\n\u201cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good . . . or Malfoy is anyway.\u201d\n\nAt once, the Marauder\u2019s Map appeared on the parchment\u2019s surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle\u2019s floors and, moving around it, the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of the castle\u2019s occupants.\n\n\u201cHelp me find Malfoy,\u201d said Harry urgently.\n\nHe laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned over it, searching.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d said Ron, after a minute or so. \u201cHe\u2019s in the Slytherin common room, look . . . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost at once.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m keeping an eye on him from now on,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cAnd the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside, it\u2019ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\nHe broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants.\n\nDespite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high level of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older \u2014 Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof.\n\nFebruary moved toward March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation, a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled. Ron was furious.\n\n\u201cIt was on my birthday!\u201d he said. \u201cI was looking forward to that!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a big surprise, though, is it?\u201d said Harry. \u201cNot after what happened to Katie.\u201d\n\nShe had still not returned from St. Mungo\u2019s. What was more, further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cBut now all I\u2019ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!\u201d said Ron grumpily. \u201cBig birthday treat . . .\u201d\n\nThree lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever, though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves. Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-feeling toward Wilkie Twycross and his three D\u2019s, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were Dogbreath and Dunghead.\n\n\u201cHappy birthday, Ron,\u201d said Harry, when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. \u201cHave a present.\u201d\n\nHe threw the package across onto Ron\u2019s bed, where it joined a small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered by house-elves in the night.\n\n\u201cCheers,\u201d said Ron drowsily and, as he ripped off the paper, Harry got out of bed, opened his own trunk, and began rummaging in it for the Marauder\u2019s Map, which he hid after every use. He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping it quietly and murmuring, \u201cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\u201d so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the time, would not hear.\n\n\u201cNice one, Harry!\u201d said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new pair of Quidditch Keeper\u2019s gloves Harry had given him.\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. \u201cHey . . . I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in his bed. . . .\u201d\n\nRon did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure.\n\n\u201cSeriously good haul this year!\u201d he announced, holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. \u201cSee what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I\u2019ll come of age next year too. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast. . . . He was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study. . . . He wasn\u2019t in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing. . . .\n\n\u201cWant one?\u201d said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons.\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d said Harry, looking up. \u201cMalfoy\u2019s gone again!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have done,\u201d said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. \u201cCome on, if you don\u2019t hurry up, you\u2019ll have to Apparate on an empty stomach. . . . Might make it easier, I suppose . . .\u201d Ron looked thoughtfully at the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third.\n\nHarry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, \u201cMischief managed,\u201d though it hadn\u2019t been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There had to be an explanation for Malfoy\u2019s periodic disappearances, but he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, but even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea: Harry had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework, and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d he said to Ron.\n\nHe was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of the rain-washed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face.\n\n\u201cRon? Breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at him.\n\n\u201cI thought you just said \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, all right, I\u2019ll come down with you,\u201d sighed Ron, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to eat.\u201d\n\nHarry scrutinized him suspiciously.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Ron sighed again. \u201cYou . . . you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open the door.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d said Ron suddenly.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, I can\u2019t stand it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stand what?\u201d asked Harry, now starting to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about her!\u201d said Ron hoarsely.\n\nHarry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender \u201cLav-Lav,\u201d he would have to put his foot down.\n\n\u201cWhy does that stop you having breakfast?\u201d Harry asked, trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she knows I exist,\u201d said Ron with a desperate gesture.\n\n\u201cShe definitely knows you exist,\u201d said Harry, bewildered. \u201cShe keeps snogging you, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nRon blinked. \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d said Harry, with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation.\n\n\u201cRomilda Vane,\u201d said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight.\n\nThey stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before Harry said, \u201cThis is a joke, right? You\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think . . . Harry, I think I love her,\u201d said Ron in a strangled voice.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, \u201cokay . . . Say that again with a straight face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love her,\u201d repeated Ron breathlessly. \u201cHave you seen her hair, it\u2019s all black and shiny and silky . . . and her eyes? Her big dark eyes? And her \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is really funny and everything,\u201d said Harry impatiently, \u201cbut joke\u2019s over, all right? Drop it.\u201d\n\nHe turned to leave; he had got two steps toward the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked around. Ron\u2019s fist was drawn right back; his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again.\n\nHarry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Levicorpus!\n\nRon yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once more; he dangled helplessly, upside down, his robes hanging off him.\n\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Harry bellowed.\n\n\u201cYou insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!\u201d shouted Ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head.\n\n\u201cThis is insane!\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat\u2019s got into \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nAnd then he saw the box lying open on Ron\u2019s bed, and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.\n\n\u201cWhere did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were a birthday present!\u201d shouted Ron, revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free. \u201cI offered you one, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just picked them up off the floor, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t fall off your bed, you prat, don\u2019t you understand? They were mine, I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map, they\u2019re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas, and they\u2019re all spiked with love potion!\u201d\n\nBut only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.\n\n\u201cRomilda?\u201d he repeated. \u201cDid you say Romilda? Harry \u2014 do you know her? Can you introduce me?\u201d\n\nHarry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him \u2014 the part closest to his throbbing right ear \u2014 was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off. . . . But on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll introduce you,\u201d said Harry, thinking fast. \u201cI\u2019m going to let you down now, okay?\u201d\n\nHe sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be in Slughorn\u2019s office,\u201d said Harry confidently, leading the way to the door.\n\n\u201cWhy will she be in there?\u201d asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to keep up.\n\n\u201cOh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,\u201d said Harry, inventing wildly.\n\n\u201cMaybe I could ask if I can have them with her?\u201d said Ron eagerly.\n\n\u201cGreat idea,\u201d said Harry.\n\nLavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication Harry had not foreseen.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late, Won-Won!\u201d she pouted. \u201cI\u2019ve got you a birthday \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d said Ron impatiently. \u201cHarry\u2019s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.\u201d\n\nAnd without another word to her, he pushed his way out of the portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender, but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.\n\nHarry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cThis is very early for a call. . . . I generally sleep late on a Saturday. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor, I\u2019m really sorry to disturb you,\u201d said Harry as quietly as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past Slughorn into his room, \u201cbut my friend Ron\u2019s swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn\u2019t make him an antidote, could you? I\u2019d take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we\u2019re not supposed to have anything from Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes and, you know . . . awkward questions . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy, Harry, an expert potioneer like you?\u201d asked Slughorn.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room, \u201cwell, I\u2019ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion, sir, and by the time I get it right, Ron might\u2019ve done something serious \u2014\u201d\n\nHelpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, \u201cI can\u2019t see her, Harry \u2014 is he hiding her?\u201d\n\n\u201cWas this potion within date?\u201d asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron with professional interest. \u201cThey can strengthen, you know, the longer they\u2019re kept.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would explain a lot,\u201d panted Harry, now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. \u201cIt\u2019s his birthday, Professor,\u201d he added imploringly.\n\n\u201cOh, all right, come in, then, come in,\u201d said Slughorn, relenting. \u201cI\u2019ve got the necessary here in my bag, it\u2019s not a difficult antidote. . . .\u201d\n\nRon burst through the door into Slughorn\u2019s overheated, crowded study, tripped over a tasseled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck, and muttered, \u201cShe didn\u2019t see that, did she?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not here yet,\u201d said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d said Ron fervently. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery handsome,\u201d said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass of clear liquid. \u201cNow drink that up, it\u2019s a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down noisily.\n\nHarry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and vanished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror.\n\n\u201cBack to normal, then?\u201d said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. \u201cThanks a lot, Professor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, m\u2019boy, don\u2019t mention it,\u201d said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. \u201cPick-me-up, that\u2019s what he needs,\u201d Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. \u201cI\u2019ve got butterbeer, I\u2019ve got wine, I\u2019ve got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead . . . hmm . . . meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas . . . ah, well . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cHe can\u2019t miss what he\u2019s never had! Why don\u2019t we open it now and celebrate Mr. Weasley\u2019s birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. . . .\u201d\n\nHe chortled again, and Harry joined in. This was the first time he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps, if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood . . . perhaps if they got through enough of the oak-matured mead . . .\n\n\u201cThere you are then,\u201d said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each before raising his own. \u201cWell, a very happy birthday, Ralph \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon \u2014\u201d whispered Harry.\n\nBut Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it.\n\nThere was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it seemed, did not.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and may you have many more \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d\n\nRon had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth, and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.\n\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d Harry bellowed. \u201cDo something!\u201d\n\nBut Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock. Ron twitched and choked: His skin was turning blue.\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 but \u2014\u201d spluttered Slughorn.\n\nHarry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn\u2019s open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible sound of Ron\u2019s gargling breath filled the room. Then he found it \u2014 the shriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions.\n\nHe hurtled back to Ron\u2019s side, wrenched open his jaw, and thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp, and his body became limp and still."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter19": "ELF TAILS\n\n\n\n\nSo, all in all, not one of Ron\u2019s better birthdays?\u201d said Fred.\n\nIt was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows curtained, the lamps lit. Ron\u2019s was the only occupied bed. Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o\u2019clock. Fred and George had arrived at ten past.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t how we imagined handing over our present,\u201d said George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron\u2019s bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ginny.\n\n\u201cYeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cThere we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him \u2014\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cYou were in Hogsmeade?\u201d asked Ginny, looking up.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking of buying Zonko\u2019s,\u201d said Fred gloomily. \u201cA Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good it\u2019ll do us if you lot aren\u2019t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore. . . . But never mind that now.\u201d\n\nHe drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron\u2019s pale face.\n\n\u201cHow exactly did it happen, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione, and to Ginny.\n\n\u201c. . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon he\u2019ll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says he\u2019ll have to stay here a week or so . . . keep taking essence of rue . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,\u201d said George in a low voice.\n\n\u201cLucky there was one in the room,\u201d said Harry, who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone.\n\nHermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened, she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny\u2019s obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until at last they had been allowed in to see him.\n\n\u201cDo Mum and Dad know?\u201d Fred asked Ginny.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago \u2014 they\u2019re in Dumbledore\u2019s office now, but they\u2019ll be back soon. . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep.\n\n\u201cSo the poison was in the drink?\u201d said Fred quietly.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again. \u201cSlughorn poured it out \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWould he have been able to slip something into Ron\u2019s glass without you seeing?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut why would Slughorn want to poison Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Fred, frowning. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would Slughorn want to poison Harry?\u201d asked Ginny.\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Fred, \u201cbut there must be loads of people who\u2019d like to poison Harry, mustn\u2019t there? \u2018The Chosen One\u2019 and all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you think Slughorn\u2019s a Death Eater?\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cAnything\u2019s possible,\u201d said Fred darkly.\n\n\u201cHe could be under the Imperius Curse,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cOr he could be innocent,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cThe poison could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019d want to kill Slughorn?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSlughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts. And . . .\u201d He thought of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from Slughorn. \u201cAnd maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas,\u201d Ginny reminded him. \u201cSo the poisoner could just as easily have been after Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the poisoner didn\u2019t know Slughorn very well,\u201d said Hermione, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold. \u201cAnyone who knew Slughorn would have known there was a good chance he\u2019d keep something that tasty for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr-my-nee,\u201d croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them.\n\nThey all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.\n\nThe dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid came striding toward them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat flapping behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of muddy dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor.\n\n\u201cBin in the forest all day!\u201d he panted. \u201cAragog\u2019s worse, I bin readin\u2019 to him \u2014 didn\u2019 get up ter dinner till jus\u2019 now an\u2019 then Professor Sprout told me abou\u2019 Ron! How is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey say he\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more than six visitors at a time!\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, hurrying out of her office.\n\n\u201cHagrid makes six,\u201d George pointed out.\n\n\u201cOh . . . yes . . .\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness. To cover her confusion, she hurried off to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019 believe this,\u201d said Hagrid hoarsely, shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron. \u201cJus\u2019 don\u2019 believe it . . . Look at him lyin\u2019 there. . . . Who\u2019d want ter hurt him, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what we were discussing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone couldn\u2019 have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team, could they?\u201d said Hagrid anxiously. \u201cFirs\u2019 Katie, now Ron . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWood might\u2019ve done the Slytherins if he could\u2019ve got away with it,\u201d said Fred fairly.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Quidditch, but I think there\u2019s a connection between the attacks,\u201d said Hermione quietly.\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you work that out?\u201d asked Fred.\n\n\u201cWell, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren\u2019t, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed. Of course,\u201d she added broodingly, \u201cthat makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they don\u2019t seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim.\u201d\n\nBefore anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement, the dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward. They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tightly. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s told us how you saved him with the bezoar,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cOh, Harry, what can we say? You saved Ginny . . . you saved Arthur . . . now you\u2019ve saved Ron . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be . . . I didn\u2019t . . .\u201d muttered Harry awkwardly.\n\n\u201cHalf our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,\u201d Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice. \u201cWell, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.\u201d\n\nHarry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ron\u2019s bed; he and Hermione rose at once to leave and Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron with his family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase. \u201cAll this new security, an\u2019 kids are still gettin\u2019 hurt. . . . Dumbledore\u2019s worried sick. . . . He don\u2019 say much, but I can tell. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t he got any ideas, Hagrid?\u201d asked Hermione desperately.\n\n\u201cI \u2019spect he\u2019s got hundreds of ideas, brain like his,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019 know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine, or they\u2019d\u2019ve bin caught, wouldn\u2019 they? Wha\u2019 worries me,\u201d said Hagrid, lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder (Harry, for good measure, checked the ceiling for Peeves), \u201cis how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein\u2019 attacked. Chamber o\u2019 Secrets all over again, isn\u2019 it? There\u2019ll be panic, more parents takin\u2019 their kids outta school, an\u2019 nex\u2019 thing yeh know the board o\u2019 governors . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long-haired woman drifted serenely past, then resumed in a hoarse whisper, \u201c. . . the board o\u2019 governors\u2019ll be talkin\u2019 about shuttin\u2019 us up fer good.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely not?\u201d said Hermione, looking worried.\n\n\u201cGotta see it from their point o\u2019 view,\u201d said Hagrid heavily. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s always bin a bit of a risk sendin\u2019 a kid ter Hogwarts, hasn\u2019 it? Yer expect accidents, don\u2019 yeh, with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether, but attempted murder, tha\u2019s diff\u2019rent. \u2019S\u2019no wonder Dumbledore\u2019s angry with Sn \u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s angry with Snape?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said tha\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway. \u201cLook at the time, it\u2019s gettin\u2019 on fer midnight, I need ter \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, why is Dumbledore angry with Snape?\u201d Harry asked loudly.\n\n\u201cShhhh!\u201d said Hagrid, looking both nervous and angry. \u201cDon\u2019 shout stuff like that, Harry, d\u2019yeh wan\u2019 me ter lose me job? Mind, I don\u2019 suppose yeh\u2019d care, would yeh, not now yeh\u2019ve given up Care of Mag \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and make me feel guilty, it won\u2019t work!\u201d said Harry forcefully. \u201cWhat\u2019s Snape done?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, Harry, I shouldn\u2019ta heard it at all! I \u2014 well, I was comin\u2019 outta the forest the other evenin\u2019 an\u2019 I overheard \u2019em talking \u2014 well, arguin\u2019. Didn\u2019t like ter draw attention to meself, so I sorta skulked an\u2019 tried not ter listen, but it was a \u2014 well, a heated discussion an\u2019 it wasn\u2019 easy ter block it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 I jus\u2019 heard Snape sayin\u2019 Dumbledore took too much fer granted an\u2019 maybe he \u2014 Snape \u2014 didn\u2019 wan\u2019 ter do it anymore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin\u2019 a bit overworked, tha\u2019s all \u2014 anyway, Dumbledore told him flat out he\u2019d agreed ter do it an\u2019 that was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him. An\u2019 then he said summat abou\u2019 Snape makin\u2019 investigations in his House, in Slytherin. Well, there\u2019s nothin\u2019 strange abou\u2019 that!\u201d Hagrid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning. \u201cAll the Heads o\u2019 Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but Dumbledore\u2019s not having rows with the rest of them, is he?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. \u201cI know what yeh\u2019re like abou\u2019 Snape, Harry, an\u2019 I don\u2019 want yeh ter go readin\u2019 more inter this than there is.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook out,\u201d said Hermione tersely.\n\nThey turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver.\n\n\u201cOho!\u201d he wheezed. \u201cOut of bed so late, this\u2019ll mean detention!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo it won\u2019, Filch,\u201d said Hagrid shortly. \u201cThey\u2019re with me, aren\u2019 they?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what difference does that make?\u201d asked Filch obnoxiously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a ruddy teacher, aren\u2019 I, yeh sneakin\u2019 Squib!\u201d said Hagrid, firing up at once.\n\nThere was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs. Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously around Filch\u2019s skinny ankles.\n\n\u201cGet goin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth.\n\nHarry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried off; Hagrid\u2019s and Filch\u2019s raised voices echoed behind them as they ran. They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower, but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cackling and calling,\n\nWhen there\u2019s strife and when there\u2019s trouble\n\nCall on Peevsie, he\u2019ll make double!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls\u2019 dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind, taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers.\n\nSo Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with him. . . . He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins . . . or, perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?\n\nWas it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry\u2019s suspicions? That seemed likely. It might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds. . . .\n\n\u201cThere you are, Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you to come back,\u201d said McLaggen, disregarding Harry\u2019s drawn wand. \u201cMust\u2019ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn\u2019t look like he\u2019ll be fit for next week\u2019s match.\u201d\n\nIt took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about.\n\n\u201cOh . . . right . . . Quidditch,\u201d he said, putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair. \u201cYeah . . . he might not make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll be playing Keeper, won\u2019t I?\u201d said McLaggen.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYeah, I suppose so. . . .\u201d\n\nHe could not think of an argument against it; after all, McLaggen had certainly performed second-best in the trials.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. \u201cSo when\u2019s practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh . . . there\u2019s one tomorrow evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I\u2019ve got some ideas on strategy you might find useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry unenthusiastically. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll hear them tomorrow, then. I\u2019m pretty tired now . . . see you . . .\u201d\n\nThe news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day, but it did not cause the sensation that Katie\u2019s attack had done. People seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that he had been in the Potions master\u2019s room at the time, and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin.\n\nHarry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking the Marauder\u2019s Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the map. . . .\n\nBut Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem, what with Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown.\n\nHe could not decide which of them was more annoying. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain.\n\nMeanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron, which Harry found almost more wearing than McLaggen\u2019s Quidditch lectures. At first, Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing \u2014 \u201cI mean, I am his girlfriend!\u201d \u2014 but unfortunately she had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats with him about Ron\u2019s feelings, a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone.\n\n\u201cLook, why don\u2019t you talk to Ron about all this?\u201d Harry asked, after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be \u201cserious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I would, but he\u2019s always asleep when I go and see him!\u201d said Lavender fretfully.\n\n\u201cIs he?\u201d said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of Dumbledore and Snape\u2019s row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as possible.\n\n\u201cIs Hermione Granger still visiting him?\u201d Lavender demanded suddenly.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think so. Well, they\u2019re friends, aren\u2019t they?\u201d said Harry uncomfortably.\n\n\u201cFriends, don\u2019t make me laugh,\u201d said Lavender scornfully. \u201cShe didn\u2019t talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he\u2019s all interesting. . . . \u201d\n\n\u201cWould you call getting poisoned being interesting?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cAnyway \u2014 sorry, got to go \u2014 there\u2019s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,\u201d said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where, thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him.\n\nOn the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him.\n\n\u201cSo how\u2019s McLaggen shaping up?\u201d he asked Harry nervously, apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you,\u201d said Harry patiently, \u201che could be world-class and I wouldn\u2019t want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us. I can\u2019t wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting shot of people,\u201d Harry added, getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt, \u201cwill you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you? She\u2019s driving me mad as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Ron, looking sheepish. \u201cYeah. All right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . well . . . it\u2019s not that easy, is it?\u201d said Ron. He paused. \u201cHermione going to look in before the match?\u201d he added casually.\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Ron, looking rather glum. \u201cRight. Well, good luck. Hope you hammer McLag \u2014 I mean, Smith.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d said Harry, shouldering his broom. \u201cSee you after the match.\u201d\n\nHe hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole school was outside, either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it. He was looking out of the windows he passed, trying to gauge how much wind they were facing, when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking toward him, accompanied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and resentful.\n\nMalfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave a short, humorless laugh and continued walking.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d Harry demanded.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really going to tell you, because it\u2019s your business, Potter,\u201d sneered Malfoy. \u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up, they\u2019ll be waiting for \u2018the Chosen Captain\u2019 \u2014 \u2018the Boy Who Scored\u2019 \u2014 whatever they call you these days.\u201d\n\nOne of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared at her. She blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend followed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view.\n\nHarry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear. This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest of the school was absent: Harry\u2019s best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to. The silent seconds trickled past, and Harry remained where he was, frozen, gazing at the place where Malfoy had vanished. . . .\n\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted into the changing rooms. The whole team was changed and ready; Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs.\n\n\u201cI met Malfoy,\u201d Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I wanted to know how come he\u2019s up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it matter right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not likely to find out, am I?\u201d said Harry, seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. \u201cCome on then!\u201d\n\nAnd without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos.\n\nThere was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.\n\n\u201cTricky conditions!\u201d McLaggen said bracingly to the team. \u201cCoote, Peakes, you\u2019ll want to fly out of the sun, so they don\u2019t see you coming \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instructions,\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cJust get up by the goalposts!\u201d\n\nOnce McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and Peakes.\n\n\u201cMake sure you do fly out of the sun,\u201d he told them grudgingly.\n\nHe shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on Madam Hooch\u2019s whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher than the rest of his team, streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch. If he could catch it good and early, there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle, seize the Marauder\u2019s Map, and find out what Malfoy was doing. . . .\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,\u201d said a dreamy voice, echoing over the grounds. \u201cHe did the commentary last time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think probably on purpose, it looked like it. Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now he\u2019s playing them \u2014 oh, look, he\u2019s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I do like her, she\u2019s very nice. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stared down at the commentator\u2019s podium. Surely nobody in their right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commentate? But even from above there was no mistaking that long, dirty-blonde hair, nor the necklace of butterbeer corks. . . . Beside Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable, as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment.\n\n\u201c. . . but now that big Hufflepuff player\u2019s got the Quaffle from her, I can\u2019t remember his name, it\u2019s something like Bibble \u2014 no, Buggins \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Cadwallader!\u201d said Professor McGonagall loudly from beside Luna. The crowd laughed.\n\nHarry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Moments later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession, with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear.\n\n\u201cMcLaggen, will you pay attention to what you\u2019re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!\u201d bellowed Harry, wheeling around to face his Keeper.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not setting a great example!\u201d McLaggen shouted back, red-faced and furious.\n\n\u201cAnd Harry Potter\u2019s now having an argument with his Keeper,\u201d said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019ll help him find the Snitch, but maybe it\u2019s a clever ruse. . . .\u201d\n\nSwearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch again, scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged golden ball.\n\nGinny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-gold-clad supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cadwallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowd\u2019s attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering from something called \u201cLoser\u2019s Lurgy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeventy-forty to Hufflepuff!\u201d barked Professor McGonagall into Luna\u2019s megaphone.\n\n\u201cIs it, already?\u201d said Luna vaguely. \u201cOh, look! The Gryffindor Keeper\u2019s got hold of one of the Beater\u2019s bats.\u201d\n\nHarry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for reasons best known to himself, had pulled Peakes\u2019s bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader.\n\n\u201cWill you give him back his bat and get back to the goalposts!\u201d roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.\n\nA blinding, sickening pain . . . a flash of light . . . distant screams . . . and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel . . .\n\nAnd the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised his head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking, freckly, red-haired person.\n\n\u201cNice of you to drop in,\u201d said Ron, grinning.\n\nHarry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hospital wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The match must have finished hours ago . . . as had any hope of cornering Malfoy. Harry\u2019s head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cCracked skull,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows. \u201cNothing to worry about, I mended it at once, but I\u2019m keeping you in overnight. You shouldn\u2019t overexert yourself for a few hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here overnight,\u201d said Harry angrily, sitting up and throwing back his covers. \u201cI want to find McLaggen and kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that would come under the heading of \u2018overexertion,\u2019\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner. \u201cYou will stay here until I discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.\u201d\n\nShe bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his pillows, fuming.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you know how much we lost by?\u201d he asked Ron through clenched teeth.\n\n\u201cWell, yeah I do,\u201d said Ron apologetically. \u201cFinal score was three hundred and twenty to sixty.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Harry savagely. \u201cReally brilliant! When I get hold of McLaggen \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get hold of him, he\u2019s the size of a troll,\u201d said Ron reasonably. \u201cPersonally, I think there\u2019s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince\u2019s. Anyway, the rest of the team might\u2019ve dealt with him before you get out of here, they\u2019re not happy. . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a note of badly suppressed glee in Ron\u2019s voice; Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly. Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.\n\n\u201cI could hear the match commentary from here,\u201d said Ron, his voice now shaking with laughter. \u201cI hope Luna always commentates from now on. . . . Loser\u2019s Lurgy . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation, and after a while Ron\u2019s snorts subsided.\n\n\u201cGinny came in to visit while you were unconscious,\u201d he said, after a long pause, and Harry\u2019s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing. . . . \u201cShe reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . .\u201d said Harry, as the scene in his mind\u2019s eye imploded. \u201cYeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn\u2019t look like they wanted to be with him, and that\u2019s the second time he\u2019s made sure he isn\u2019t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember?\u201d Harry sighed. \u201cWish I\u2019d followed him now, the match was such a fiasco. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Ron sharply. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy, you\u2019re the Captain!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know what he\u2019s up to,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s all in my head, not after what I overheard between him and Snape \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said it was all in your head,\u201d said Ron, hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at Harry, \u201cbut there\u2019s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! You\u2019re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to follow him . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to catch him at it!\u201d said Harry in frustration. \u201cI mean, where\u2019s he going when he disappears off the map?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno . . . Hogsmeade?\u201d suggested Ron, yawning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the map. I thought they were being watched now anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, I dunno,\u201d said Ron.\n\nSilence fell between them. Harry stared up at the circle of lamplight above him, thinking. . . .\n\nIf only he had Rufus Scrimgeour\u2019s power, he would have been able to set a tail upon Malfoy, but unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of Aurors at his command. . . . He thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the D.A., but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons; most of them, after all, still had full schedules. . . .\n\nThere was a low, rumbling snore from Ron\u2019s bed. After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wearing a thick dressing gown. It was easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand. The lamps dimmed, and she returned to her office; he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed.\n\nThis was, Harry reflected in the darkness, the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury. Last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch, and the time before that, all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart. . . . That had been his most painful injury by far . . . he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night, a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry sat bolt upright, his heart pounding, his bandage turban askew. He had the solution at last: There was a way to have Malfoy followed \u2014 how could he have forgotten, why hadn\u2019t he thought of it before?\n\nBut the question was, how to call him? What did you do?\n\nQuietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness.\n\n\u201cKreacher?\u201d\n\nThere was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room. Ron awoke with a yelp.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHarry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey\u2019s office and muttered, \u201cMuffliato!\u201d so that she would not come running. Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on.\n\nTwo house-elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats, the other, a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth. Then there was another loud bang, and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves.\n\n\u201cI was watching that, Potty!\u201d he told Harry indignantly, pointing at the fight below, before letting out a loud cackle. \u201cLook at the ickle creatures squabbling, bitey bitey, punchy punchy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he won\u2019t, or Dobby will shut Kreacher\u2019s mouth for him!\u201d cried Dobby in a high-pitched voice.\n\n\u201c\u2014 kicky, scratchy!\u201d cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further. \u201cTweaky, pokey!\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher\u2019s mistress say \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nExactly what Kreacher\u2019s mistress would have said they did not find out, for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreacher\u2019s mouth and knocked out half of his teeth. Harry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart, though they continued to try and kick and punch each other, egged on by Peeves, who swooped around the lamp squealing, \u201cStick your fingers up his nosey, draw his cork and pull his earsies \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry aimed his wand at Peeves and said, \u201cLanglock!\u201d Peeves clutched at his throat, gulped, then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak, owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth.\n\n\u201cNice one,\u201d said Ron appreciatively, lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher. \u201cThat was another Prince hex, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, twisting Kreacher\u2019s wizened arm into a half nelson. \u201cRight \u2014 I\u2019m forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, you\u2019re forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know I\u2019m not allowed to give you orders \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do!\u201d said Dobby, tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper.\n\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d said Harry, and he and Ron both released the elves, who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting.\n\n\u201cMaster called me?\u201d croaked Kreacher, sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death.\n\n\u201cYeah, I did,\u201d said Harry, glancing toward Madam Pomfrey\u2019s office door to check that the Muffliato spell was still working; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher will do whatever Master wants,\u201d said Kreacher, sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes, \u201cbecause Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby will do it, Harry Potter!\u201d squeaked Dobby, his tennis-ball-sized eyes still swimming in tears. \u201cDobby would be honored to help Harry Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOkay then . . . I want you to tail Draco Malfoy.\u201d\n\nIgnoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron\u2019s face, Harry went on, \u201cI want to know where he\u2019s going, who he\u2019s meeting, and what he\u2019s doing. I want you to follow him around the clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Harry Potter!\u201d said Dobby at once, his great eyes shining with excitement. \u201cAnd if Dobby does it wrong, Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower, Harry Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any need for that,\u201d said Harry hastily.\n\n\u201cMaster wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?\u201d croaked Kreacher. \u201cMaster wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old mistress?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately. \u201cAnd you\u2019re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show him what you\u2019re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him messages or . . . or to contact him in any way. Got it?\u201d\n\nHe thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited. After a moment or two, and to Harry\u2019s great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply again and said, with bitter resentment, \u201cMaster thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy, oh yes. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s settled, then,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ll want regular reports, but make sure I\u2019m not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron and Hermione are okay. And don\u2019t tell anyone what you\u2019re doing. Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters.\u201d"}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter20": "LORD VOLDEMORT\u2019S REQUEST\n\n\n\n\nHarry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning, restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poisoned, the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again. Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast, bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean. The drowsing creature in Harry\u2019s chest suddenly raised its head, sniffing the air hopefully.\n\n\u201cWhat did they row about?\u201d he asked, trying to sound casual as they turned onto a seventh-floor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus. She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right!\u201d said Hermione kindly, hurrying forward to help her. \u201cHere . . .\u201d\n\nShe tapped the broken scales with her wand and said, \u201cReparo.\u201d The girl did not say thank you, but remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight; Ron glanced back at her.\n\n\u201cI swear they\u2019re getting smaller,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNever mind her,\u201d said Harry, a little impatiently. \u201cWhat did Ginny and Dean row about, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cIt must\u2019ve looked funny,\u201d said Ron reasonably.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t look funny at all!\u201d said Hermione hotly. \u201cIt looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes hadn\u2019t caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it,\u201d said Harry, still trying to sound casual. \u201cOr are they still together?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they are \u2014 but why are you so interested?\u201d asked Hermione, giving Harry a sharp look.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want my Quidditch team messed up again!\u201d he said hastily, but Hermione continued to look suspicious, and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called, \u201cHarry!\u201d giving him an excuse to turn his back on her.\n\n\u201cOh, hi, Luna.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went to the hospital wing to find you,\u201d said Luna, rummaging in her bag. \u201cBut they said you\u2019d left. . . .\u201d\n\nShe thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron\u2019s hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry.\n\n\u201c. . . I\u2019ve been told to give you this.\u201d\n\nIt was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d he told Ron and Hermione, once he had unrolled it.\n\n\u201cNice commentary last match!\u201d said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion, the toadstool, and the cat litter. Luna smiled vaguely.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone says I was dreadful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious!\u201d said Ron earnestly. \u201cI can\u2019t remember enjoying commentary more! What is this, by the way?\u201d he added, holding the onionlike object up to eye level.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a Gurdyroot,\u201d she said, stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag. \u201cYou can keep it if you like, I\u2019ve got a few of them. They\u2019re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies.\u201d\n\nAnd she walked away, leaving Ron chortling, still clutching the Gurdyroot.\n\n\u201cYou know, she\u2019s grown on me, Luna,\u201d he said, as they set off again for the Great Hall. \u201cI know she\u2019s insane, but it\u2019s in a good \u2014\u201d\n\nHe stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Ron nervously.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Harry muttered to Hermione, and they sped past, though not before they had heard Lavender say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were getting out today? And why was she with you?\u201d\n\nRon looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later, and though he sat with Lavender, Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together. Hermione was acting as though she was quite oblivious to all of this, but once or twice Harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face. All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood, and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over (in other words, finish writing) Harry\u2019s Herbology essay, something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point, because she had known that Harry would then let Ron copy his work.\n\n\u201cThanks a lot, Hermione,\u201d said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight o\u2019clock. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to hurry or I\u2019ll be late for Dumbledore. . . .\u201d\n\nShe did not answer, but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of way. Grinning, Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmaster\u2019s office. The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee \u00e9clairs, and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a time, knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight.\n\n\u201cEnter,\u201d called Dumbledore, but as Harry put out a hand to push the door, it was wrenched open from inside. There stood Professor Trelawney.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d she cried, pointing dramatically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacles. \u201cSo this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office, Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Sybill,\u201d said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice, \u201cthere is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere, but Harry does have an appointment, and I really don\u2019t think there is any more to be said \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, in a deeply wounded voice. \u201cIf you will not banish the usurping nag, so be it. . . . Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated. . . .\u201d\n\nShe pushed past Harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase; they heard her stumble halfway down, and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls.\n\n\u201cPlease close the door and sit down, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding rather tired.\n\nHarry obeyed, noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledore\u2019s desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more, as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.\n\n\u201cProfessor Trelawney still isn\u2019t happy Firenze is teaching, then?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cDivination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself. I cannot ask Firenze to return to the forest, where he is now an outcast, nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave. Between ourselves, she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle. She does not know \u2014 and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her \u2014 that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort, you see.\u201d\n\nDumbledore heaved a deep sigh, then said, \u201cBut never mind my staffing problems. We have much more important matters to discuss. Firstly \u2014 have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to, Harry had almost forgotten about the memory Dumbledore had asked him to extract from Professor Slughorn. \u201cWell, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn\u2019t give it to me.\u201d\n\nThere was a little silence.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. \u201cAnd you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble. \u201cWell . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did that work?\u201d asked Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWell, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery, however, I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you. I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is. Indeed, I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it.\u201d\n\nA hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry\u2019s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d he said, a little desperately, \u201cit isn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t bothered or anything, I\u2019ve just had other \u2014 other things . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOther things on your mind,\u201d Dumbledore finished the sentence for him. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\nSilence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore\u2019s head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. When he could stand it no longer he said, \u201cProfessor Dumbledore, I\u2019m really sorry. I should have done more. . . . I should have realized you wouldn\u2019t have asked me to do it if it wasn\u2019t really important.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for saying that, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cMay I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it, sir, I\u2019ll get it from him,\u201d he said earnestly.\n\n\u201cThen we shall say no more about it just now,\u201d said Dumbledore more kindly, \u201cbut continue with our story where we left off. You remember where that was?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cVoldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it. Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked . . . he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes,\u201d he mumbled shamefacedly.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNow, you will remember, I hope, that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus far, as I hope you agree, I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cBut now, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cnow things become murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts. However, I have two last memories that I would like to share with you.\u201d Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve. \u201cI shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely.\u201d\n\nThe idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light and examined it.\n\n\u201cI hope you are not tired of diving into other people\u2019s memories, for they are curious recollections, these two,\u201d he said. \u201cThis first one came from a very old house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cHe reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Borgin and Burkes?\u201d Harry repeated, stunned.\n\n\u201cAt Borgin and Burkes,\u201d repeated Dumbledore calmly. \u201cI think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey\u2019s memory. But this was not Voldemort\u2019s first choice of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time \u2014 I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided \u2014 but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to stay here? Why?\u201d asked Harry, more amazed still.\n\n\u201cI believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cFirstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.\u201d\n\nHarry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap.\n\n\u201cAnd thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin to build himself an army.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he didn\u2019t get the job, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he still wished to teach.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you feel about that, sir?\u201d asked Harry hesitantly.\n\n\u201cDeeply uneasy,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI had advised Armando against the appointment \u2014 I did not give the reasons I have given you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school, and especially not in a position of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to teach?\u201d\n\nSomehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.\n\n\u201cDefense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years.\n\n\u201cSo Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet he was,\u201d said Harry, unable to contain himself.\n\n\u201cWell, quite,\u201d said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. \u201cAnd now it is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.\u201d\n\nDumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, \u201cAfter you, Harry.\u201d\n\nHarry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house-elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.\n\n\u201cHurry up, Hokey!\u201d said Hepzibah imperiously. \u201cHe said he\u2019d come at four, it\u2019s only a couple of minutes to and he\u2019s never been late yet!\u201d\n\nShe tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The top of the elf\u2019s head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah\u2019s chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga.\n\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror.\n\n\u201cLovely, madam,\u201d squeaked Hokey.\n\nHarry could only assume that it was down in Hokey\u2019s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion.\n\nA tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.\n\n\u201cQuick, quick, he\u2019s here, Hokey!\u201d cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.\n\nThe house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah\u2019s fat little hand, brushing it with his lips.\n\n\u201cI brought you flowers,\u201d he said quietly, producing a bunch of roses from nowhere.\n\n\u201cYou naughty boy, you shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d squealed old Hepzibah, though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table. \u201cYou do spoil this old lady, Tom. . . . Sit down, sit down. . . . Where\u2019s Hokey? Ah . . .\u201d\n\nThe house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress\u2019s elbow.\n\n\u201cHelp yourself, Tom,\u201d said Hepzibah, \u201cI know how you love my cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that shop, I\u2019ve said it a hundred times. . . .\u201d\n\nVoldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.\n\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s your excuse for visiting this time?\u201d she asked, batting her lashes.\n\n\u201cMr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin-made armor,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cFive hundred Galleons, he feels it is a more than fair \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, now, not so fast, or I\u2019ll think you\u2019re only here for my trinkets!\u201d pouted Hepzibah.\n\n\u201cI am ordered here because of them,\u201d said Voldemort quietly. \u201cI am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Mr. Burke, phooey!\u201d said Hepzibah, waving a little hand. \u201cI\u2019ve something to show you that I\u2019ve never shown Mr. Burke! Can you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won\u2019t tell Mr. Burke I\u2019ve got it? He\u2019d never let me rest if he knew I\u2019d shown it to you, and I\u2019m not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom, you\u2019ll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can get for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,\u201d said Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle.\n\n\u201cI had Hokey bring it out for me. . . . Hokey, where are you? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. . . . In fact, bring both, while you\u2019re at it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, madam,\u201d squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables, pouffes, and footstools.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf, laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, \u201cI think you\u2019ll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was showing you. . . . They can\u2019t wait to get their hands on this!\u201d\n\nShe opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles.\n\n\u201cI wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a good look!\u201d whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah\u2019s face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort\u2019s handsome features.\n\n\u201cA badger,\u201d murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving upon the cup. \u201cThen this was . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHelga Hufflepuff\u2019s, as you very well know, you clever boy!\u201d said Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I was distantly descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and years. Lovely, isn\u2019t it? And all sorts of powers it\u2019s supposed to possess too, but I haven\u2019t tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice and safe in here. . . .\u201d\n\nShe hooked the cup back off Voldemort\u2019s long forefinger and restored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort\u2019s face as the cup was taken away.\n\n\u201cNow then,\u201d said Hepzibah happily, \u201cwhere\u2019s Hokey? Oh yes, there you are \u2014 take that away now, Hokey.\u201d\n\nThe elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll like this even more, Tom,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLean in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I\u2019ve got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he\u2019d love to get it back when I\u2019m gone. . . .\u201d\n\nShe slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box. There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.\n\nVoldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time, and held it up to the light, staring at it.\n\n\u201cSlytherin\u2019s mark,\u201d he said quietly, as the light played upon an ornate, serpentine S.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. \u201cI had to pay an arm and a leg for it, but I couldn\u2019t let it pass, not a real treasure like that, had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no idea of its true value \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort\u2019s eyes flashed scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket\u2019s chain.\n\n\u201c\u2014 I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . . Pretty, isn\u2019t it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it, though I just keep it nice and safe. . . .\u201d\n\nShe reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.\n\n\u201cSo there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed that!\u201d\n\nShe looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw her foolish smile falter.\n\n\u201cAre you all right, dear?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Voldemort quietly. \u201cYes, I\u2019m very well. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought \u2014 but a trick of the light, I suppose \u2014\u201d said Hepzibah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemort\u2019s eyes. \u201cHere, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again. . . . The usual enchantments . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTime to leave, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly, and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cHepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,\u201d said Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same. \u201cHokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress\u2019s evening cocoa by accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way!\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\n\u201cI see we are of one mind,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cCertainly, there are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHokey confessed?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe remembered putting something in her mistress\u2019s cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cIt was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that is my conclusion too,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd, just as with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 because she was a house-elf,\u201d said Harry. He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W.\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cShe was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over \u2014 but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.\n\n\u201cBy the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah\u2019s family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having always guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well, had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cif you don\u2019t mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin\u2019s ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibah\u2019s cup and locket.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Harry, frowning, \u201cit seems mad. . . . Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for those . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe locket maybe,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut why take the cup as well?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had belonged to another of Hogwarts\u2019s founders,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There were other reasons, I think. . . . I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course.\n\n\u201cAnd now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn\u2019s memory for us. Ten years separate Hokey\u2019s memory and this one, ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve.\n\n\u201cWhose memory is it?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cMine,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nAnd Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass, landing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was Dumbledore, who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry, though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between the present-day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge.\n\nThe younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something, and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on the door and he said, \u201cEnter.\u201d\n\nHarry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snakelike, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his features had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly distorted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.\n\nThe Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise. Evidently this visit had been made by appointment.\n\n\u201cGood evening, Tom,\u201d said Dumbledore easily. \u201cWon\u2019t you sit down?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured \u2014 the very seat, by the looks of it, that Harry had just vacated in the present. \u201cI heard that you had become headmaster,\u201d he said, and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been. \u201cA worthy choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad you approve,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cMay I offer you a drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be welcome,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cI have come a long way.\u201d\n\nDumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve, but which then was full of bottles. Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he returned to the seat behind his desk.\n\n\u201cSo, Tom . . . to what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d\n\nVoldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine.\n\n\u201cThey do not call me \u2018Tom\u2019 anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days, I am known as \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you are known as,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling pleasantly. \u201cBut to me, I\u2019m afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle. It is one of the irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges\u2019 youthful beginnings.\u201d\n\nHe raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore\u2019s refusal to use Voldemort\u2019s chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such.\n\n\u201cI am surprised you have remained here so long,\u201d said Voldemort after a short pause. \u201cI always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore, still smiling, \u201cto a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it still,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cI merely wondered why you \u2014 who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThree times at the last count, actually,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in common, I think.\u201d\n\nVoldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of wine. Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for Voldemort to talk first.\n\n\u201cI have returned,\u201d he said, after a little while, \u201clater, perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.\u201d\n\nDumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking.\n\n\u201cYes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cRumors of your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them.\u201d\n\nVoldemort\u2019s expression remained impassive as he said, \u201cGreatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou call it \u2018greatness,\u2019 what you have been doing, do you?\u201d asked Dumbledore delicately.\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. \u201cI have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf some kinds of magic,\u201d Dumbledore corrected him quietly. \u201cOf some. Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage.\n\n\u201cThe old argument,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,\u201d suggested Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWell, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts?\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cWill you let me return? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.\u201d\n\nDumbledore raised his eyebrows. \u201cAnd what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves \u2014 or so rumor has it \u2014 the Death Eaters?\u201d\n\nHarry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name; he saw Voldemort\u2019s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare.\n\n\u201cMy friends,\u201d he said, after a moment\u2019s pause, \u201cwill carry on without me, I am sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear that you consider them friends,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d said Voldemort.\n\n\u201cThen if I were to go to the Hog\u2019s Head tonight, I would not find a group of them \u2014 Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov \u2014 awaiting your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post.\u201d\n\nThere could be no doubt that Dumbledore\u2019s detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort; however, he rallied almost at once.\n\n\u201cYou are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,\u201d said Dumbledore lightly. \u201cNow, Tom . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture.\n\n\u201cLet us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, surrounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not want?\u201d\n\nVoldemort looked coldly surprised. \u201cA job I do not want? On the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you\u2019re after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?\u201d\n\nVoldemort sneered. \u201cIf you do not want to give me a job \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think for a moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you asked, you must have had a purpose.\u201d\n\nVoldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever, his features thick with rage. \u201cThis is your final word?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d said Dumbledore, also standing.\n\n\u201cThen we have nothing more to say to each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, nothing,\u201d said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. \u201cThe time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. . . . I wish I could. . . .\u201d\n\nFor a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning: He was sure that Voldemort\u2019s hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Voldemort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone.\n\nHarry felt Dumbledore\u2019s hand close over his arm again and moments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot, but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Dumbledore\u2019s hand was blackened and dead-looking once more.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore\u2019s face. \u201cWhy did he come back? Did you ever find out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have ideas,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cbut no more than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat ideas, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWhen you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear . . . to both of us.\u201d\n\nHarry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him, he did not move at once.\n\n\u201cWas he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn\u2019t say. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThe aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.\u201d"}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter21": "THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM\n\n\n\n\nHarry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find anything in there,\u201d said Hermione firmly, late on Sunday evening.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t start, Hermione,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the Prince, Ron wouldn\u2019t be sitting here now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would if you\u2019d just listened to Snape in our first year,\u201d said Hermione dismissively.\n\nHarry ignored her. He had just found an incantation (\u201cSectumsempra!\u201d) scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words \u201cFor Enemies,\u201d and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page.\n\nThey were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.\n\nRon had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not managed to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.\n\n\u201cAt least you can Apparate, though!\u201d said Ron tensely. \u201cYou\u2019ll have no trouble come July!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only done it once,\u201d Harry reminded him; he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson.\n\nHaving wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorn\u2019s memory was the most important thing to him now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, the stupid Prince isn\u2019t going to be able to help you with this, Harry!\u201d said Hermione, more loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to force someone to do what you want, and that\u2019s the Imperius Curse, which is illegal \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know that, thanks,\u201d said Harry, not looking up from the book. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for something different. Dumbledore says Veritaserum won\u2019t do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a spell. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going about it the wrong way,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cOnly you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people can\u2019t. It\u2019s not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you spell \u2018belligerent\u2019?\u201d said Ron, shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment. \u201cIt can\u2019t be B \u2014 U \u2014 M \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione, pulling Ron\u2019s essay toward her. \u201cAnd \u2018augury\u2019 doesn\u2019t begin O \u2014 R \u2014 G either. What kind of quill are you using?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of Fred and George\u2019s Spell-Check ones . . . but I think the charm must be wearing off. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it must,\u201d said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, \u201cbecause we were asked how we\u2019d deal with dementors, not \u2018Dugbogs,\u2019 and I don\u2019t remember you changing your name to \u2018Roonil Wazlib\u2019 either.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh no!\u201d said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. \u201cDon\u2019t say I\u2019ll have to write the whole thing out again!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we can fix it,\u201d said Hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand.\n\n\u201cI love you, Hermione,\u201d said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily.\n\nHermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, \u201cDon\u2019t let Lavender hear you saying that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said Ron into his hands. \u201cOr maybe I will . . . then she\u2019ll ditch me . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ditch her if you want to finish it?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t ever chucked anyone, have you?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou and Cho just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSort of fell apart, yeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWish that would happen with me and Lavender,\u201d said Ron gloomily, watching Hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. \u201cBut the more I hint I want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. It\u2019s like going out with the giant squid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back Ron\u2019s essay.\n\n\u201cThanks a million,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCan I borrow your quill for the conclusion?\u201d\n\nHarry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince\u2019s notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his essay. The only sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermione\u2019s quill. Harry had just closed the Half-Blood Prince\u2019s book, yawning, when \u2014\n\nCrack.\n\nHermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and Harry said, \u201cKreacher!\u201d\n\nThe house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes.\n\n\u201cMaster said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing, so Kreacher has come to give \u2014\u201d\n\nCrack.\n\nDobby appeared alongside Kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew.\n\n\u201cDobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!\u201d he squeaked, casting Kreacher a resentful look. \u201cAnd Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Hermione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her.\n\n\u201cWell . . . they\u2019ve been following Malfoy for me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNight and day,\u201d croaked Kreacher.\n\n\u201cDobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!\u201d said Dobby proudly, swaying where he stood.\n\nHermione looked indignant.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn\u2019t tell him not to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, of course I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cDobby, you can sleep, all right? But has either of you found out anything?\u201d he hastened to ask, before Hermione could intervene again.\n\n\u201cMaster Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood,\u201d croaked Kreacher at once. \u201cHis features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDraco Malfoy is a bad boy!\u201d squeaked Dobby angrily. \u201cA bad boy who \u2014 who \u2014\u201d\n\nHe shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it; Harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby struggled, then went limp.\n\n\u201cThank you, Harry Potter,\u201d he panted. \u201cDobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to Kreacher, \u201cBut Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a house-elf!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we don\u2019t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy,\u201d Harry told Kreacher. \u201cLet\u2019s fast forward to where he\u2019s actually been going.\u201d\n\nKreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, \u201cMaster Malfoy eats in the Great Hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons, he attends his classes in a variety of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby, you tell me,\u201d said Harry, cutting across Kreacher. \u201cHas he been going anywhere he shouldn\u2019t have?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, sir,\u201d squeaked Dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, \u201cthe Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while he enters \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Room of Requirement!\u201d said Harry, smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion-Making. Hermione and Ron stared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s where he\u2019s been sneaking off to! That\u2019s where he\u2019s doing . . . whatever he\u2019s doing! And I bet that\u2019s why he\u2019s been disappearing off the map \u2014 come to think of it, I\u2019ve never seen the Room of Requirement on there!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the Marauders never knew the room was there,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be part of the magic of the room,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIf you need it to be Unplottable, it will be.\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy\u2019s doing?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cNo, Harry Potter, that is impossible,\u201d said Dobby.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cMalfoy got into our headquarters there last year, so I\u2019ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you will, Harry,\u201d said Hermione slowly. \u201cMalfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn\u2019t he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don\u2019t know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don\u2019t know what to ask it to transform into.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be a way around that,\u201d said Harry dismissively. \u201cYou\u2019ve done brilliantly, Dobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher\u2019s done well too,\u201d said Hermione kindly; but far from looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, \u201cThe Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of it,\u201d Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated. \u201cYou\u2019d better go and get some sleep too, Dobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Harry Potter, sir!\u201d squeaked Dobby happily, and he too vanished.\n\n\u201cHow good\u2019s this?\u201d said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. \u201cWe know where Malfoy\u2019s going! We\u2019ve got him cornered now!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s great,\u201d said Ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay. Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s all this about him going up there with a \u2018variety of students\u2019?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHow many people are in on it? You wouldn\u2019t think he\u2019d trust lots of them to know what he\u2019s doing. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that is weird,\u201d said Harry, frowning. \u201cI heard him telling Crabbe it wasn\u2019t Crabbe\u2019s business what he was doing . . . so what\u2019s he telling all these . . . all these . . .\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.\n\n\u201cGod, I\u2019ve been stupid,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could\u2019ve nicked some any time during that lesson. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNicked what?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cPolyjuice Potion. He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions lesson. . . . There aren\u2019t a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy . . . it\u2019s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual. . . . Yeah, it all fits!\u201d said Harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. \u201cThey\u2019re stupid enough to do what they\u2019re told even if he won\u2019t tell them what he\u2019s up to . . . but he doesn\u2019t want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement, so he\u2019s got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people. . . . Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch \u2014 ha! Crabbe and Goyle!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean to say,\u201d said Hermione in a hushed voice, \u201cthat that little girl whose scales I repaired \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, of course!\u201d said Harry loudly, staring at her. \u201cOf course! Malfoy must\u2019ve been inside the room at the time, so she \u2014 what am I talking about? \u2014 he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! We\u2019ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?\u201d guffawed Ron. \u201cBlimey . . . No wonder they don\u2019t look too happy these days. . . . I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t tell him to stuff it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they wouldn\u2019t, would they, if he\u2019s shown them his Dark Mark?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHmmm . . . the Dark Mark we don\u2019t know exists,\u201d said Hermione skeptically, rolling up Ron\u2019s dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Harry confidently.\n\n\u201cYes, we will,\u201d Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching. \u201cBut, Harry, before you get all excited, I still don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what\u2019s there first. And I don\u2019t think you should forget\u201d \u2014 she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look \u2014 \u201cthat what you\u2019re supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night.\u201d\n\nHarry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the door to the girls\u2019 dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cWish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,\u201d said Ron, staring at the spot where Dobby had vanished. \u201cI\u2019d have that Apparition Test in the bag.\u201d\n\nHarry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like hours, wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement and what he, Harry, would see when he went in there the following day, for whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see Malfoy\u2019s . . . what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A storeroom? A workshop? Harry\u2019s mind worked feverishly and his dreams, when he finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into Snape. . . .\n\nHarry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room, which irritated Harry, because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl, to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten about Slughorn, but I haven\u2019t got a clue how to get that memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn\u2019t I find out what Malfoy\u2019s doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement\u201d \u2014 she jerked the Prophet out from under Harry\u2019s hand and unfolded it to look at the front page \u2014 \u201cyou should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone we know \u2014 ?\u201d asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the headlines.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast. \u201cBut it\u2019s all right, he\u2019s not dead \u2014 it\u2019s Mundungus, he\u2019s been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary . . . and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. . . . Oh, and how horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse. . . .\u201d\n\nThey finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off immediately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snape\u2019s dementor essay; and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet.\n\nHarry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy inside it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an eleven-year-old girl.\n\nHe closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room of Requirement\u2019s door was concealed. He knew what he had to do; he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating with all his might he thought, I need to see what Malfoy\u2019s doing in here. . . . I need to see what Malfoy\u2019s doing in here. . . . I need to see what Malfoy\u2019s doing in here. . . .\n\nThree times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding with excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it \u2014\u201d\n\nBut he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall.\n\nHe moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone remained solid and unyielding.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry aloud. \u201cOkay . . . I thought the wrong thing. . . .\u201d\n\nHe pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, concentrating as hard as he could.\n\nI need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . . I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . .\n\nAfter three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly.\n\nThere was no door.\n\n\u201cOh, come off it,\u201d he told the wall irritably. \u201cThat was a clear instruction. . . . Fine . . .\u201d\n\nHe thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more.\n\nI need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy. . . .\n\nHe did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes.\n\nThere was still no door.\n\nHarry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost.\n\nHarry tried every variation of \u201cI need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you\u201d that he could think of for a whole hour, at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frustrated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts, pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went.\n\n\u201cLate again, Potter,\u201d said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom. \u201cTen points from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nHarry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron; half the class was still on its feet, taking out books and organizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them.\n\n\u201cBefore we start, I want your dementor essays,\u201d said Snape, waving his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. \u201cAnd I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your books to page \u2014 what is it, Mr. Finnigan?\u201d\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Seamus, \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering, how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, there wasn\u2019t,\u201d said Snape in a bored voice.\n\n\u201cBut sir, I heard people talking \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,\u201d muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione. \u201cShouldn\u2019t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,\u201d said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. \u201cLet us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.\u201d\n\nThe whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 well \u2014 ghosts are transparent \u2014\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOh, very good,\u201d interrupted Snape, his lip curling. \u201cYes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. \u2018Ghosts are transparent.\u2019\u201d\n\nPansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other people were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly, though his insides were boiling, \u201cYeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren\u2019t they? So they\u2019d be solid \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA five-year-old could have told us as much,\u201d sneered Snape. \u201cThe Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard\u2019s spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard\u2019s bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth . . . and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what Harry said is the most useful if we\u2019re trying to tell them apart!\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhen we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we\u2019re going to be having a shufti to see if it\u2019s solid, aren\u2019t we, we\u2019re not going to be asking, \u2018Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?\u2019\u201d\n\nThere was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class.\n\n\u201cAnother ten points from Gryffindor,\u201d said Snape. \u201cI would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry\u2019s arm as he opened his mouth furiously. \u201cThere\u2019s no point, you\u2019ll just end up in detention again, leave it!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,\u201d said Snape, smirking a little, \u201cand read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse. . . .\u201d\n\nRon was very subdued all through the class. When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron\u2019s Apparition, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys\u2019 bathroom with Harry.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s right, though, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Ron, after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two. \u201cI dunno whether it\u2019s worth me taking the test. I just can\u2019t get the hang of Apparition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you,\u201d said Harry reasonably. \u201cIt\u2019ll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if you\u2019re still not \u2014 you know \u2014 as good as you\u2019d like to be, you can postpone the test, do it with me over the summ \u2014 Myrtle, this is the boys\u2019 bathroom!\u201d\n\nThe ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through thick, white, round glasses.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said glumly. \u201cIt\u2019s you two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho were you expecting?\u201d said Ron, looking at her in the mirror.\n\n\u201cNobody,\u201d said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin. \u201cHe said he\u2019d come back and see me, but then you said you\u2019d pop in and visit me too\u201d \u2014 she gave Harry a reproachful look \u2014 \u201cand I haven\u2019t seen you for months and months. I\u2019ve learned not to expect too much from boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you lived in that girls\u2019 bathroom?\u201d said Harry, who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d she said, with a sulky little shrug, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cVividly,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut I thought he liked me,\u201d she said plaintively. \u201cMaybe if you two left, he\u2019d come back again. . . . We had lots in common. . . . I\u2019m sure he felt it. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd she looked hopefully toward the door.\n\n\u201cWhen you say you had lots in common,\u201d said Ron, sounding rather amused now, \u201cd\u2019you mean he lives in an S-bend too?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom. \u201cI mean he\u2019s sensitive, people bully him too, and he feels lonely and hasn\u2019t got anybody to talk to, and he\u2019s not afraid to show his feelings and cry!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a boy in here crying?\u201d said Harry curiously. \u201cA young boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever you mind!\u201d said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on Ron, who was now definitely grinning. \u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, and I\u2019ll take his secret to the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 not the grave, surely?\u201d said Ron with a snort. \u201cThe sewers, maybe . . .\u201d\n\nMyrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test.\u201d\n\nAnd so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d do better,\u201d said Hermione, when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, \u201cto go straight to Slughorn\u2019s office and try and get that memory from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying!\u201d said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true. He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice, Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply, though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I\u2019ve been trying to get him on his own again, and he\u2019s not going to let it happen!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve just got to keep at it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was doing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Hermione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement.\n\nOnce out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder\u2019s Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, \u201cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good,\u201d and scanned it carefully.\n\nAs it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. . . . There were a few people out in the grounds . . . and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering, \u201cHello . . . you\u2019re very pretty, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nGoyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.\n\nYet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief; Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.\n\n\u201cOUCH!\u201d\n\nHe thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\nHe spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his utter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d he said, scrambling to his feet again; why did she always have to find him lying on the floor?\n\n\u201cI came to see Dumbledore,\u201d said Tonks.\n\nHarry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her mouse-colored hair lank.\n\n\u201cHis office isn\u2019t here,\u201d said Harry, \u201cit\u2019s round the other side of the castle, behind the gargoyle \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Tonks. \u201cHe\u2019s not there. Apparently he\u2019s gone away again.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas he?\u201d said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor. \u201cHey \u2014 you don\u2019t know where he goes, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tonks.\n\n\u201cWhat did you want to see him about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing in particular,\u201d said Tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, at the sleeve of her robe. \u201cI just thought he might know what\u2019s going on. . . . I\u2019ve heard rumors . . . people getting hurt . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know, it\u2019s all been in the papers,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat little kid trying to kill his \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Prophet\u2019s often behind the times,\u201d said Tonks, who didn\u2019t seem to be listening to him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had any letters from anyone in the Order recently?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one from the Order writes to me anymore,\u201d said Harry, \u201cnot since Sirius \u2014\u201d\n\nHe saw that her eyes had filled with tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he muttered awkwardly. \u201cI mean . . . I miss him, as well. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him. \u201cWell . . . I\u2019ll see you around, Harry . . .\u201d\n\nAnd she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor, leaving Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come.\n\nHe found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway through an early lunch.\n\n\u201cI did it \u2014 well, kind of!\u201d Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him. \u201cI was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoot\u2019s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up near Scrivenshaft\u2019s, but at least I moved!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood one,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHow\u2019d you do, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, she was perfect, obviously,\u201d said Ron, before Hermione could answer. \u201cPerfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is \u2014 we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should\u2019ve heard Twycross going on about her \u2014 I\u2019ll be surprised if he doesn\u2019t pop the question soon \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. \u201cHave you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!\u201d\n\n\u201cTonks?\u201d repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking surprised.\n\n\u201cYeah, she said she\u2019d come to visit Dumbledore. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask me,\u201d said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks, \u201cshe\u2019s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit odd,\u201d said Hermione, who for some reason looked very concerned. \u201cShe\u2019s supposed to be guarding the school, why\u2019s she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he\u2019s not even here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a thought,\u201d said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about voicing it; this was much more Hermione\u2019s territory than his. \u201cYou don\u2019t think she can have been . . . you know . . . in love with Sirius?\u201d\n\nHermione stared at him.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth makes you say that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Harry, shrugging, \u201cbut she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name . . . and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. . . . I wondered whether it hadn\u2019t become . . . you know . . . him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thought,\u201d said Hermione slowly. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t know why she\u2019d be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that\u2019s really why she was here. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGoes back to what I said, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron, who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. \u201cShe\u2019s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women,\u201d he said wisely to Harry, \u201cthey\u2019re easily upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, \u201cI doubt you\u2019d find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn\u2019t laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia.\u201d\n\nRon scowled."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter22": "AFTER THE BURIAL\n\n\n\n\nPatches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets, but these signs of approaching summer did not lift Harry\u2019s mood. He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead, somehow, to Slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades.\n\n\u201cFor the last time, just forget about Malfoy,\u201d Hermione told Harry firmly.\n\nThey were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch. Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet \u2014 Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them \u2014 for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves.\n\nRon gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around the corner.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t Lavender,\u201d said Hermione wearily.\n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d said Ron, relaxing.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter?\u201d said the girl. \u201cI was asked to give you this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks . . .\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment. Once the girl was out of earshot he said, \u201cDumbledore said we wouldn\u2019t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he wants to check on how you\u2019re doing?\u201d suggested Hermione, as Harry unrolled the parchment; but rather than finding Dumbledore\u2019s long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run.\n\n\n\nDear Harry, Ron, and Hermione,\n\n\n\nAragog died last night. Harry and Ron, you met him, and you know how special he was. Hermione, I know you\u2019d have liked him. It would mean a lot to me if you\u2019d nip down for the burial later this evening. I\u2019m planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day. I know you\u2019re not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak. Wouldn\u2019t ask, but I can\u2019t face it alone.\n\n\n\nHagrid\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLook at this,\u201d said Harry, handing the note to Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d she said, scanning it quickly and passing it to Ron, who read it through looking increasingly incredulous.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s mental!\u201d he said furiously. \u201cThat thing told its mates to eat Harry and me! Told them to help themselves! And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHe\u2019s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security\u2019s a million times tighter and how much trouble we\u2019d be in if we were caught.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been down to see him by night before,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, but for something like this?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe\u2019ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all \u2014 Aragog\u2019s dead. If it were a question of saving him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 I\u2019d want to go even less,\u201d said Ron firmly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t meet him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot.\u201d\n\nHarry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it. Tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry, you can\u2019t be thinking of going,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pointless thing to get detention for.\u201d\n\nHarry sighed. \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he said. \u201cI s\u2019pose Hagrid\u2019ll have to bury Aragog without us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he will,\u201d said Hermione, looking relieved. \u201cLook, Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests. . . . Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then!\u201d\n\n\u201cFifty-seventh time lucky, you think?\u201d said Harry bitterly.\n\n\u201cLucky,\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cHarry, that\u2019s it \u2014 get lucky!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cUse your lucky potion!\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s it!\u201d said Hermione, sounding stunned. \u201cOf course! Why didn\u2019t I think of it?\u201d\n\nHarry stared at them both. \u201cFelix Felicis?\u201d he said. \u201cI dunno . . . I was sort of saving it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d demanded Ron incredulously.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\nHarry did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry? Are you still with us?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cWha \u2014 ? Yeah, of course,\u201d he said, pulling himself together. \u201cWell . . . okay. If I can\u2019t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I\u2019ll take some Felix and have another go this evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s decided, then,\u201d said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette. \u201cDestination . . . determination . . . deliberation . . .\u201d she murmured.\n\n\u201cOh, stop that,\u201d Ron begged her, \u201cI feel sick enough as it is \u2014 quick, hide me!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t Lavender!\u201d said Hermione impatiently, as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d said Ron, peering over Hermione\u2019s shoulder to check. \u201cBlimey, they don\u2019t look happy, do they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the Montgomery sisters and of course they don\u2019t look happy, didn\u2019t you hear what happened to their little brother?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m losing track of what\u2019s happening to everyone\u2019s relatives, to be honest,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungo\u2019s, they couldn\u2019t save him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died?\u201d repeated Harry, shocked. \u201cBut surely werewolves don\u2019t kill, they just turn you into one of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey sometimes kill,\u201d said Ron, who looked unusually grave now. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was the werewolf\u2019s name?\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cWell, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cI knew it \u2014 the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one Lupin told me about!\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\nHermione looked at him bleakly.\n\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019ve got to get that memory,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about stopping Voldemort, isn\u2019t it? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him. . . .\u201d\n\nThe bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their feet, looking terrified.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do fine,\u201d Harry told them both, as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you too!\u201d said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry headed off to the dungeons.\n\nThere were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry, Ernie, and Draco Malfoy.\n\n\u201cAll too young to Apparate just yet?\u201d said Slughorn genially. \u201cNot turned seventeen yet?\u201d\n\nThey shook their heads.\n\n\u201cAh well,\u201d said Slughorn cheerily, \u201cas we\u2019re so few, we\u2019ll do something fun. I want you all to brew me up something amusing!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds good, sir,\u201d said Ernie sycophantically, rubbing his hands together. Malfoy, on the other hand, did not crack a smile.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018something amusing\u2019?\u201d he said irritably.\n\n\u201cOh, surprise me,\u201d said Slughorn airily.\n\nMalfoy opened his copy of Advanced Potion-Making with a sulky expression. It could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching him over the top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement.\n\nWas it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look thinner? Certainly he looked paler; his skin still had that grayish tinge, probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. But there was no air of smugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort. . . . There could be only one conclusion, in Harry\u2019s opinion: The mission, whatever it was, was going badly.\n\nCheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood Prince\u2019s version of \u201cAn Elixir to Induce Euphoria,\u201d which seemed not only to meet Slughorn\u2019s instructions, but which might (Harry\u2019s heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him to taste some. . . .\n\n\u201cWell, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,\u201d said Slughorn an hour and a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harry\u2019s cauldron. \u201cEuphoria, I take it? And what\u2019s that I smell? Mmmm . . . you\u2019ve added just a sprig of peppermint, haven\u2019t you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspiration, Harry, of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking. . . . I really don\u2019t know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . unless \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry pushed the Half-Blood Prince\u2019s book deeper into his bag with his foot.\n\n\u201c\u2014 it\u2019s just your mother\u2019s genes coming out in you!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . yeah, maybe,\u201d said Harry, relieved.\n\nErnie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Harry for once, he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron. Malfoy was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely \u201cpassable.\u201d\n\nThe bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry, he hurried away as fast as he could.\n\n\u201cProfessor \u2014 Professor, don\u2019t you want to taste my po \u2014 ?\u201d called Harry desperately.\n\nBut Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the cauldron, packed up his things, left the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room.\n\nRon and Hermione returned in the late afternoon.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. \u201cHarry, I passed!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell done!\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe \u2014 he just failed,\u201d whispered Hermione, as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. \u201cIt was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that he\u2019d left half an eyebrow behind. . . . How did it go with Slughorn?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo joy,\u201d said Harry, as Ron joined them. \u201cBad luck, mate, but you\u2019ll pass next time \u2014 we can take it together.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I s\u2019pose,\u201d said Ron grumpily. \u201cBut half an eyebrow! Like that matters!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Hermione soothingly, \u201cit does seem really harsh. . . .\u201d\n\nThey spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner, and Ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room, now discussing the continuing problem of Slughorn and the memory.\n\n\u201cSo, Harry \u2014 you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?\u201d Ron demanded.\n\n\u201cYeah, I s\u2019pose I\u2019d better,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t reckon I\u2019ll need all of it, not twelve hours\u2019 worth, it can\u2019t take all night. . . . I\u2019ll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling when you take it,\u201d said Ron reminiscently. \u201cLike you can\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Hermione, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ve never taken any!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but I thought I had, didn\u2019t I?\u201d said Ron, as though explaining the obvious. \u201cSame difference really . . .\u201d\n\nAs they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn\u2019s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after checking carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys\u2019 dormitory.\n\nHarry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle.\n\n\u201cWell, here goes,\u201d said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and took a carefully measured gulp.\n\n\u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\nHarry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all . . . and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy. . . .\n\nHe got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d he said. \u201cReally excellent. Right . . . I\u2019m going down to Hagrid\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast.\n\n\u201cNo, Harry \u2014 you\u2019ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry confidently. \u201cI\u2019m going to Hagrid\u2019s, I\u2019ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?\u201d asked Ron, looking stunned.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now.\n\n\u201cThis is Felix Felicis, I suppose?\u201d said Hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got another little bottle full of \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEssence of Insanity?\u201d suggested Ron, as Harry swung his Cloak over his shoulders.\n\nHarry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more alarmed.\n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing . . . or at least\u201d \u2014 he strolled confidently to the door \u2014 \u201cFelix does.\u201d\n\nHe pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door.\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing up there with her?\u201d shrieked Lavender Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys\u2019 dormitories. Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them.\n\nGetting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and Harry was able to slip between them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t push me, please, Dean,\u201d she said, sounding annoyed. \u201cYou\u2019re always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my own. . . .\u201d\n\nThe portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had heard Dean make an angry retort. . . . His feeling of elation increasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest: This evening, he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts.\n\nWhy he knew that going to Hagrid\u2019s was the right thing to do, he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time: He could not see the final destination, he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door. Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk.\n\nIt was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrid\u2019s. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked behind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation.\n\n\u201cI do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,\u201d Slughorn was saying courteously, \u201cmost authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I quite agree,\u201d said Professor Sprout warmly. \u201cThat enough for you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlenty, plenty,\u201d said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. \u201cThis should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. . . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!\u201d\n\nProfessor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and Slughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood, invisible.\n\nSeized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pulled off the Cloak with a flourish.\n\n\u201cGood evening, Professor.\u201d\n\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s beard, Harry, you made me jump,\u201d said Slughorn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. \u201cHow did you get out of the castle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Filch must\u2019ve forgotten to lock the doors,\u201d said Harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be reporting that man, he\u2019s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out here, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, sir, it\u2019s Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty upset. . . . But you won\u2019t tell anyone, Professor? I don\u2019t want trouble for him. . . .\u201d\n\nSlughorn\u2019s curiosity was evidently aroused. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t promise that,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cBut I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt, so I\u2019m sure he can\u2019t be up to anything very dreadful. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s this giant spider, he\u2019s had it for years. . . . It lived in the forest. . . . It could talk and everything \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,\u201d said Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. \u201cIt\u2019s true, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid ever got, it died last night. He\u2019s devastated. He wants company while he buries it and I said I\u2019d go.\u201d\n\n\u201cTouching, touching,\u201d said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrid\u2019s cabin. \u201cBut acromantula venom is very valuable . . . If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn\u2019t want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset . . . but if there was any way to procure some . . . I mean, it\u2019s almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it\u2019s alive. . . .\u201d\n\nSlughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now.\n\n\u201c. . . seems an awful waste not to collect it . . . might get a hundred Galleons a pint. . . . To be frank, my salary is not large. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd now Harry saw clearly what was to be done.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, \u201cwell, if you wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really pleased. . . . Give Aragog a better send-off, you know . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm. \u201cI tell you what, Harry, I\u2019ll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . We\u2019ll drink the poor beast\u2019s \u2014 well \u2014 not health \u2014 but we\u2019ll send it off in style, anyway, once it\u2019s buried. And I\u2019ll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occasion. . . .\u201d\n\nHe bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid\u2019s, delighted with himself.\n\n\u201cYeh came,\u201d croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him.\n\n\u201cYeah \u2014 Ron and Hermione couldn\u2019t, though,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey\u2019re really sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 \u2014 don\u2019 matter . . . He\u2019d\u2019ve bin touched yeh\u2019re here, though, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach.\n\n\u201cWhere are we burying him?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe forest?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, no,\u201d said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt. \u201cThe other spiders won\u2019 let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog\u2019s gone. Turns out it was on\u2019y on his orders they didn\u2019 eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?\u201d\n\nThe honest answer was \u201cyes\u201d; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid.\n\n\u201cNever bin an area o\u2019 the forest I couldn\u2019 go before!\u201d said Hagrid, shaking his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019 easy, gettin\u2019 Aragog\u2019s body out o\u2019 there, I can tell yeh \u2014 they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give \u2019im a nice burial . . . a proper send-off . . .\u201d\n\nHe broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do), \u201cProfessor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in trouble, are yeh?\u201d said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed. \u201cYeh shouldn\u2019 be outta the castle in the evenin\u2019, I know it, it\u2019s my fault \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he\u2019d like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s gone to change into something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he\u2019d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog\u2019s memory. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he?\u201d said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched. \u201cTha\u2019s \u2014 tha\u2019s righ\u2019 nice of him, that is, an\u2019 not turnin\u2019 yeh in either. I\u2019ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin\u2019 ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well . . . he\u2019d\u2019ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid\u2019s hut, where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled.\n\n\u201cAre we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?\u201d\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,\u201d said Hagrid in a choked voice. \u201cI\u2019ve already dug the \u2014 yeh know \u2014 grave. Jus\u2019 thought we\u2019d say a few nice things over him \u2014 happy memories, yeh know \u2014\u201d\n\nHis voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door, and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold, several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d he said, in a deep, grave voice. \u201cSo very sorry to hear of your loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cTha\u2019s very nice of yeh,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThanks a lot. An\u2019 thanks fer not givin\u2019 Harry detention neither. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t have dreamed of it,\u201d said Slughorn. \u201cSad night, sad night . . . Where is the poor creature?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut here,\u201d said Hagrid in a shaking voice. \u201cShall we \u2014 shall we do it, then?\u201d\n\nThe three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon was glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled with the light spilling from Hagrid\u2019s window to illuminate Aragog\u2019s body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high mound of freshly dug earth.\n\n\u201cMagnificent,\u201d said Slughorn, approaching the spider\u2019s head, where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge, curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, apparently examining the enormous hairy head.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ev\u2019ryone appreciates how beau\u2019iful they are,\u201d said Hagrid to Slughorn\u2019s back, tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019 know yeh were int\u2019rested in creatures like Aragog, Horace.\u201d\n\n\u201cInterested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,\u201d said Slughorn, stepping back from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once more, noticed nothing. \u201cNow . . . shall we proceed to the burial?\u201d\n\nHagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud. Hagrid started to cry again.\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s difficult for you, who knew him best,\u201d said Slughorn, who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrid\u2019s elbow, but patted it all the same. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I say a few words?\u201d\n\nHe must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog, Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, \u201cFarewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won\u2019t forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.\u201d\n\n\u201cTha\u2019 was . . . tha\u2019 was . . . beau\u2019iful!\u201d howled Hagrid, and he collapsed onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever.\n\n\u201cThere, there,\u201d said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash, onto the dead spider, forming a smooth mound. \u201cLet\u2019s get inside and have a drink. Get on his other side, Harry. . . . That\u2019s it. . . . Up you come, Hagrid . . . Well done . . .\u201d\n\nThey deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry\u2019s lap as usual. Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought.\n\n\u201cI have had it all tested for poison,\u201d he assured Harry, pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid\u2019s bucket-sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid. \u201cHad a house-elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.\u201d\n\nHarry saw, in his mind\u2019s eye, the expression on Hermione\u2019s face if she ever heard about this abuse of house-elves, and decided never to mention it to her.\n\n\u201cOne for Harry . . .\u201d said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle between two mugs, \u201c. . . and one for me. Well\u201d \u2014 he raised his mug high \u2014 \u201cto Aragog.\u201d\n\n\u201cAragog,\u201d said Harry and Hagrid together.\n\nBoth Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he must not drink, so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him.\n\n\u201cI had him from an egg, yeh know,\u201d said Hagrid morosely. \u201cTiny little thing he was when he hatched. \u2019Bout the size of a Pekingese.\u201d\n\n\u201cSweet,\u201d said Slughorn.\n\n\u201cUsed ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . . well . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not seem to be listening; he was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of brass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright white hair.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d said Hagrid indifferently. \u201cGets pulled out of their tails, they catch it on branches an\u2019 stuff in the forest, yeh know . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my dear chap, do you know how much that\u2019s worth?\u201d\n\n\u201cI use it fer bindin\u2019 on bandages an\u2019 stuff if a creature gets injured,\u201d said Hagrid, shrugging. \u201cIt\u2019s dead useful . . . very strong, see.\u201d\n\nSlughorn took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, Harry knew, for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak-matured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smoking jackets. He refilled Hagrid\u2019s mug and his own, and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and Slughorn\u2019s flattering interest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry.\n\nThe Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.\n\nAfter an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to elf-made wine, and to \u2014\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d cried Slughorn a little thickly, \u201cParry Otter, the Chosen Boy Who \u2014 well \u2014 something of that sort,\u201d he mumbled, and drained his mug too.\n\nNot long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of, \u201cTo friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!\u201d\n\nAnd for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo.\n\n\u201cAaargh, the good die young,\u201d muttered Hagrid, slumping low onto the table, a little cross-eyed, while Slughorn continued to warble the refrain. \u201cMe dad was no age ter go . . . nor were yer mum an\u2019 dad, Harry . . .\u201d\n\nGreat fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid\u2019s crinkled eyes again; he grasped Harry\u2019s arm and shook it.\n\n\u201cBes\u2019 wiz and witchard o\u2019 their age I never knew . . . terrible thing . . . terrible thing . . .\u201d\n\nAnd Odo the hero, they bore him back home\n\nTo the place that he\u2019d known as a lad,\n\n\n\n\n\nsang Slughorn plaintively.\n\nThey laid him to rest with his hat inside out\n\nAnd his wand snapped in two, which was sad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c. . . terrible,\u201d Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Slughorn with a hiccup. \u201cCan\u2019t carry a tune to save my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid wasn\u2019t talking about your singing,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cHe was talking about my mum and dad dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. \u201cOh dear. Yes, that was \u2014 was terrible indeed. Terrible . . . terrible . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling their mugs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t suppose you remember it, Harry?\u201d he asked awkwardly.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 well, I was only one when they died,\u201d said Harry, his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagrid\u2019s heavy snores. \u201cBut I\u2019ve found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Slughorn in a hushed voice.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum,\u201d said Harry.\n\nSlughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cHe told her to get out of the way,\u201d said Harry remorselessly. \u201cHe told me she needn\u2019t have died. He only wanted me. She could have run.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d breathed Slughorn. \u201cShe could have . . . she needn\u2019t . . . That\u2019s awful. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t move. Dad was already dead, but she didn\u2019t want me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort . . . but he just laughed. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d said Slughorn suddenly, raising a shaking hand. \u201cReally, my dear boy, enough . . . I\u2019m an old man . . . I don\u2019t need to hear . . . I don\u2019t want to hear . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI forgot,\u201d lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. \u201cYou liked her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLiked her?\u201d said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once more. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine anyone who met her wouldn\u2019t have liked her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funny . . . It was the most horrible thing. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t help her son,\u201d said Harry. \u201cShe gave me her life, but you won\u2019t give me a memory.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry looked steadily into Slughorn\u2019s tear-filled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable to look away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a question . . . If it were to help you, of course . . . but no purpose can be served . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can,\u201d said Harry clearly. \u201cDumbledore needs information. I need information.\u201d\n\nHe knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning. Looking Slughorn straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little.\n\n\u201cI am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory.\u201d\n\nSlughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat.\n\n\u201cYou are the Chosen One?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d said Harry calmly.\n\n\u201cBut then . . . my dear boy . . . you\u2019re asking a great deal . . . you\u2019re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, Harry, of course I do, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re scared he\u2019ll find out you helped me?\u201d\n\nSlughorn said nothing; he looked terrified.\n\n\u201cBe brave like my mother, Professor. . . .\u201d\n\nSlughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby.\n\n\u201cI am not proud . . .\u201d he whispered through his fingers. \u201cI am ashamed of what \u2014 of what that memory shows. . . . I think I may have done great damage that day. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt would be a very brave and noble thing to do.\u201d\n\nHagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle. There was a long, long silence, but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait.\n\nThen, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Harry\u2019s eyes, Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging to the wand-tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry.\n\n\u201cThank you very much, Professor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good boy,\u201d said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got her eyes. . . . Just don\u2019t think too badly of me once you\u2019ve seen it. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he too put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter23": "HORCRUXES\n\n\n\n\nHarry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle. The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of time do you call this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry \u2014 I had to go out for something important \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the password changed at midnight, so you\u2019ll just have to sleep in the corridor, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy did it have to change at midnight?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way it is,\u201d said the Fat Lady. \u201cIf you\u2019re angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s tightened security.\u201d\n\n\u201cFantastic,\u201d said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. \u201cReally brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he\u2019s the one who wanted me to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is here,\u201d said a voice behind Harry. \u201cProfessor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.\u201d\n\nNearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff.\n\n\u201cI had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,\u201d said Nick. \u201cHe appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d said Harry, his heart leaping.\n\n\u201cOh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it\u2019s a favorite pastime of his \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the Bloody Baron \u2014 Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 in his office,\u201d said Nick. \u201cI believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he has,\u201d said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him.\n\n\u201cCome back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password\u2019s still \u2018tapeworm\u2019!\u201d\n\nBut Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying \u201ctoffee \u00e9clairs\u201d to Dumbledore\u2019s gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase.\n\n\u201cEnter,\u201d said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted.\n\nHarry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore\u2019s office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows.\n\n\u201cGood gracious, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore in surprise. \u201cTo what do I owe this very late pleasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 I\u2019ve got it. I\u2019ve got the memory from Slughorn.\u201d\n\nHarry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile.\n\n\u201cHarry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!\u201d\n\nAll thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn\u2019s memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. \u201cNow, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .\u201d\n\nHarry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn\u2019s office many years before.\n\nThere was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple. And there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo\u2019s gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger.\n\nDumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, \u201cSir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\u201d\n\n\u201cTom, Tom, if I knew I couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. \u201cI must say, I\u2019d like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\u201d\n\nRiddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks.\n\n\u201cWhat with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn\u2019t, and your careful flattery of the people who matter \u2014 thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you\u2019re quite right, it is my favorite \u2014\u201d\n\nSeveral of the boys tittered again.\n\n\u201c\u2014 I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the Ministry.\u201d\n\nTom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that politics would suit me, sir,\u201d he said when the laughter had died away. \u201cI don\u2019t have the right kind of background, for one thing.\u201d\n\nA couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader\u2019s famous ancestor.\n\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d said Slughorn briskly, \u201ccouldn\u2019t be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you\u2019ll go far, Tom, I\u2019ve never been wrong about a student yet.\u201d\n\nThe small golden clock standing upon Slughorn\u2019s desk chimed eleven o\u2019clock behind him and he looked around.\n\n\u201cGood gracious, is it that time already? You\u2019d better get going, boys, or we\u2019ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it\u2019s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\u201d\n\nOne by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there.\n\n\u201cLook sharp, Tom, you don\u2019t want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I wanted to ask you something.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk away, then, m\u2019boy, ask away. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?\u201d\n\nSlughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass.\n\n\u201cProject for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?\u201d\n\nBut Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork.\n\n\u201cNot exactly, sir,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cI came across the term while reading and I didn\u2019t fully understand it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo . . . well . . . you\u2019d be hard-pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that\u2019ll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that\u2019s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,\u201d said Slughorn.\n\n\u201cBut you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you \u2014 sorry, I mean, if you can\u2019t tell me, obviously \u2014 I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could \u2014 so I just thought I\u2019d ask \u2014\u201d\n\nIt was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, \u201cwell, it can\u2019t hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand how that works, though, sir,\u201d said Riddle.\n\nHis voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement.\n\n\u201cWell, you split your soul, you see,\u201d said Slughorn, \u201cand hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one\u2019s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form . . .\u201d\n\nSlughorn\u2019s face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before: \u201cI was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive.\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\u201d\n\nBut Riddle\u2019s hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing.\n\n\u201cHow do you split your soul?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Slughorn uncomfortably, \u201cyou must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do you do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy an act of evil \u2014 the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEncase? But how \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a spell, do not ask me, I don\u2019t know!\u201d said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \u201cDo I look as though I have tried it \u2014 do I look like a killer?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, of course not,\u201d said Riddle quickly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry . . . I didn\u2019t mean to offend . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all, not at all, not offended,\u201d said Slughorn gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand, though \u2014 just out of curiosity \u2014 I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn\u2019t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn\u2019t seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn\u2019t seven \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s beard, Tom!\u201d yelped Slughorn. \u201cSeven! Isn\u2019t it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .\u201d\n\nSlughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he muttered, \u201cthis is all hypothetical, what we\u2019re discussing, isn\u2019t it? All academic . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, of course,\u201d said Riddle quickly.\n\n\u201cBut all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I\u2019ve told \u2014 that\u2019s to say, what we\u2019ve discussed. People wouldn\u2019t like to think we\u2019ve been chatting about Horcruxes. It\u2019s a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore\u2019s particularly fierce about it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say a word, sir,\u201d said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . .\n\n\u201cThank you, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cLet us go. . . .\u201d\n\nWhen Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak.\n\n\u201cI have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\u201d said Dumbledore at last. \u201cIt confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet.\n\n\u201cWell, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cI am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he succeeded then, sir?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cHe made a Horcrux? And that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit . . . or more,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYou heard Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know \u2014 as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew \u2014 no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\u201d\n\nDumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts, and then said, \u201cFour years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou handed it to me, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThe diary, Riddle\u2019s diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book . . . a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered.\n\n\u201cWhat intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work \u2014 in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin\u2019s monster would be unleashed again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t want his hard work to be wasted,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe wanted people to know he was Slytherin\u2019s heir, because he couldn\u2019t take credit at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite correct,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding. \u201cBut don\u2019t you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blas\u00e9 about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else\u2019s path and run the risk that they might destroy it \u2014 as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that.\n\n\u201cThe careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made \u2014 or been planning to make \u2014 more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense.\n\n\u201cThen you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. \u2018I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.\u2019 That was what you told me he said. \u2018Further than anybody.\u2019 And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call \u2018usual evil\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he make a Sorcerer\u2019s Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer\u2019s Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort.\n\n\u201cWhile the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain their immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see . . . or as close to immortal as any man can be.\n\n\u201cBut now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn\u2019t seven the most powerfully magical number . . . \u2019 Isn\u2019t seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe made seven Horcruxes?\u201d said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. \u201cBut they could be anywhere in the world \u2014 hidden \u2014 buried or invisible \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cBut firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack \u2014 the piece that lives in his body.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the six Horcruxes, then,\u201d said Harry, a little desperately, \u201chow are we supposed to find them?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cYes indeed,\u201d said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \u201cThe ring, Harry. Marvolo\u2019s ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been \u2014 forgive me the lack of seemly modesty \u2014 for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape\u2019s timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort\u2019s soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how did you find it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort\u2019s past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts\u2019 house. It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment.\n\n\u201cHowever, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they could be anything?\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey could be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe diary wasn\u2019t that special.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the other Horcruxes?\u201d said Harry. \u201cDo you think you know what they are, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can only guess,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cFor the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort\u2019s past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe locket!\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cHufflepuff\u2019s cup!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling, \u201cI would be prepared to bet \u2014 perhaps not my other hand \u2014 but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort\u2019s imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw\u2019s. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\u201d\n\nDumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case.\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts, sir?\u201d said Harry. \u201cTo try and find something from one of the other founders?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy thoughts precisely,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders\u2019 objects. He definitely had two \u2014 he may have found three \u2014 that is the best we can do for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if he got something of Ravenclaw\u2019s or of Gryffindor\u2019s, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\u201d said Harry, counting on his fingers. \u201cUnless he got both?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe snake?\u201d said Harry, startled. \u201cYou can use animals as Horcruxes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it is inadvisable to do so,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cbecause to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents\u2019 house with the intention of killing you.\n\n\u201cHe seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death.\n\n\u201cAs we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort\u2019s mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthe diary\u2019s gone, the ring\u2019s gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw\u2019s or Gryffindor\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\u201d said Dumbledore, bowing his head.\n\n\u201cSo . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you\u2019ve been going when you\u2019ve been leaving the school?\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have been looking for a very long time. I think . . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you do,\u201d said Harry quickly, \u201ccan I come with you and help get rid of it?\u201d\n\nDumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \u201cYes, I think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can?\u201d said Harry, thoroughly taken aback.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \u201cI think you have earned that right.\u201d\n\nHarry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore\u2019s decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted.\n\n\u201cDoes Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\u201d Harry asked, ignoring the portraits.\n\n\u201cA very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort\u2019s say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary.\n\n\u201cNo doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius\u2019s fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master\u2019s soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence \u2014 but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley\u2019s daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort\u2019s fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\u201d\n\nHarry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \u201cSo if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I think so,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWithout his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t got uncommon skill and power,\u201d said Harry, before he could stop himself.\n\n\u201cYes, you have,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly. \u201cYou have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d said Harry impatiently. \u201cI can love!\u201d It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \u201cBig deal!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Harry, you can love,\u201d said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \u201cWhich, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, when the prophecy says that I\u2019ll have \u2018power the Dark Lord knows not,\u2019 it just means \u2014 love?\u201d asked Harry, feeling a little let down.\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 just love,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him \u2014 and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it comes to the same \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t!\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \u201cYou are setting too much store by the prophecy!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d spluttered Harry, \u201cbut you said the prophecy means \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Harry, bewildered, \u201cbut last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney\u2019s words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don\u2019t you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is essential that you understand this!\u201d said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \u201cBy attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort\u2019s fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort\u2019s world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort\u2019s followers!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I haven\u2019t!\u201d said Harry indignantly. \u201cHe killed my mum and dad!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\u201d said Dumbledore loudly. \u201cThe only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort\u2019s! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart\u2019s desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not!\n\n\u201cBut he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort\u2019s mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, sir,\u201d said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, \u201cit all comes to the same thing, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve got to try and kill him, or \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGot to?\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cOf course you\u2019ve got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you\u2019ve tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\u201d\n\nHarry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d want him finished,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d want to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you would!\u201d cried Dumbledore. \u201cYou see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat one of us is going to end up killing the other,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nBut he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew \u2014 and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents \u2014 that there was all the difference in the world."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter24": "SECTUMSEMPRA\n\n\n\n\nExhausted but delighted with his night\u2019s work, Harry told Ron and Hermione everything that had happened during next morning\u2019s Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them). They were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about Voldemort\u2019s Horcruxes and Dumbledore\u2019s promise to take Harry along, should he find another one.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them everything; Ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing. \u201cWow. You\u2019re actually going to go with Dumbledore . . . and try and destroy . . . wow.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, you\u2019re making it snow,\u201d said Hermione patiently, grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which, sure enough, large white flakes had started to fall. Lavender Brown, Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes, and Hermione immediately let go of Ron\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. \u201cSorry . . . looks like we\u2019ve all got horrible dandruff now. . . .\u201d\n\nHe brushed some of the fake snow off Hermione\u2019s shoulder. Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her.\n\n\u201cWe split up,\u201d he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cLast night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn\u2019t see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell \u2014 you don\u2019t mind it\u2019s over, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ron admitted. \u201cIt was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn\u2019t have to finish it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoward,\u201d said Hermione, though she looked amused. \u201cWell, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.\u201d\n\nHarry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that, but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga. Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, \u201cHow come?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she couldn\u2019t climb in herself . . . but they\u2019ve been a bit rocky for ages.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom. He certainly looked unhappy.\n\n\u201cOf course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cThe Quidditch team,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIf Ginny and Dean aren\u2019t speaking . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 oh yeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFlitwick,\u201d said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of Harry\u2019s and Ron\u2019s were still murky brown.\n\n\u201cNow, now, boys,\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. \u201cA little less talk, a little more action . . . Let me see you try. . . .\u201d\n\nTogether they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. Harry\u2019s vinegar turned to ice; Ron\u2019s flask exploded.\n\n\u201cYes . . . for homework,\u201d said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, \u201cpractice.\u201d\n\nThey had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together. Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender, and Hermione seemed cheery too, though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said, \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day.\u201d Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harry\u2019s brain:\n\nShe\u2019s Ron\u2019s sister.\n\nBut she\u2019s ditched Dean!\n\nShe\u2019s still Ron\u2019s sister.\n\nI\u2019m his best mate!\n\nThat\u2019ll make it worse.\n\nIf I talked to him first \u2014\n\nHe\u2019d hit you.\n\nWhat if I don\u2019t care?\n\nHe\u2019s your best mate!\n\nHarry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room, and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered together there, until Hermione cried, \u201cKatie! You\u2019re back! Are you okay?\u201d\n\nHarry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really well!\u201d she said happily. \u201cThey let me out of St. Mungo\u2019s on Monday, I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning. Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cwell, now you\u2019re back and Ron\u2019s fit, we\u2019ll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . .\u201d\n\nHe had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his brain. He dropped his voice as Katie\u2019s friends started gathering up their things; apparently they were late for Transfiguration.\n\n\u201c. . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been asking me, but I haven\u2019t got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies\u2019 in the Three Broomsticks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou definitely went into the bathroom, then?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, I know I pushed open the door,\u201d said Katie, \u201cso I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my memory\u2019s a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo\u2019s. Listen, I\u2019d better go, I wouldn\u2019t put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back. . . .\u201d\n\nShe caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them.\n\n\u201cSo it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cto be in the ladies\u2019 bathroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr someone who looked like a girl or a woman,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts. We know some of it got stolen. . . .\u201d\n\nIn his mind\u2019s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past, all transformed into girls.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to take another swig of Felix,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand have a go at the Room of Requirement again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be a complete waste of potion,\u201d said Hermione flatly, putting down the copy of Spellman\u2019s Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag. \u201cLuck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn\u2019t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Don\u2019t go wasting the rest of that potion! You\u2019ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him . . .\u201d She dropped her voice to a whisper.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t we make some more?\u201d Ron asked Harry, ignoring Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . .\u201d\n\nHarry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and looked up Felix Felicis.\n\n\u201cBlimey, it\u2019s seriously complicated,\u201d he said, running an eye down the list of ingredients. \u201cAnd it takes six months . . . You\u2019ve got to let it stew. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTypical,\u201d said Ron.\n\nHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned \u201cFor Enemies,\u201d that he had marked a few weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up behind him unawares.\n\nThe only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back.\n\nThe following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying extremely well.\n\nGinny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean; on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goalposts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch.\n\nThe battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron\u2019s expression when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. . . .\n\nYet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties, for Ron would not be around \u2014 but unfortunately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermione\u2019s help, but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn\u2019t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good.\n\nAll in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Hermione put it, \u201ctweaking the circumstances\u201d? The balmy days slid gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry\u2019s shoulder every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything else.\n\nRon was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.\n\nThe run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features: members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game had become inextricably linked in Harry\u2019s mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis.\n\nIn the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy was up to in the Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder\u2019s Map, and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall remained firmly doorless.\n\nA few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arithmancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder\u2019s Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy\u2019s tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys\u2019 bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle.\n\nHarry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.\n\nDraco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d crooned Moaning Myrtle\u2019s voice from one of the cubicles. \u201cDon\u2019t . . . tell me what\u2019s wrong . . . I can help you. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one can help me,\u201d said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. . . . I can\u2019t. . . . It won\u2019t work . . . and unless I do it soon . . . he says he\u2019ll kill me. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying \u2014 actually crying \u2014 tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder.\n\nMalfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry pulled out his own. Malfoy\u2019s hex missed Harry by inches, shattering the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways, thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another \u2014\n\n\u201cNo! No! Stop it!\u201d squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room. \u201cStop! STOP!\u201d\n\nThere was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded; Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoy\u2019s ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, \u201cCruci \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSECTUMSEMPRA!\u201d bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his wand wildly.\n\nBlood spurted from Malfoy\u2019s face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014\u201d gasped Harry.\n\nSlipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees beside Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: \u201cMURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!\u201d\n\nThe door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terrified: Snape had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it over the deep wounds Harry\u2019s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy\u2019s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting.\n\nHarry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had performed his countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy into a standing position.\n\n\u201cYou need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that. . . . Come. . . .\u201d\n\nHe supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury, \u201cAnd you, Potter . . . You wait here for me.\u201d\n\nIt did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment.\n\nSnape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at once, leaving a ringing silence behind her.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it to happen,\u201d said Harry at once. His voice echoed in the cold, watery space. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what that spell did.\u201d\n\nBut Snape ignored this. \u201cApparently I underestimated you, Potter,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWho would have thought you knew such Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 read about it somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was \u2014 a library book,\u201d Harry invented wildly. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what it was call \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLiar,\u201d said Snape. Harry\u2019s throat went dry. He knew what Snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it. . . .\n\nThe bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled to block out all thought, but try as he might, the Half-Blood Prince\u2019s copy of Advanced Potion-Making swam hazily to the forefront of his mind.\n\nAnd then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into Snape\u2019s black eyes, hoping against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but \u2014\n\n\u201cBring me your schoolbag,\u201d said Snape softly, \u201cand all of your schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me here. Now!\u201d\n\nThere was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed out of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower. Most people were walking the other way; they gaped at him, drenched in water and blood, but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past.\n\nHe felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book? And what would happen when Snape saw it? Would he tell Slughorn \u2014 Harry\u2019s stomach churned \u2014 how Harry had been achieving such good results in Potions all year? Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Harry so much . . . the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? Harry could not let it happen. . . . He could not . . .\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you \u2014 ? Why are you soaking \u2014 ? Is that blood?\u201d\n\nRon was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at the sight of Harry.\n\n\u201cI need your book,\u201d Harry panted. \u201cYour Potions book. Quick . . . give it to me . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about the Half-Blood \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain later!\u201d\n\nRon pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and handed it over; Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw himself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off along the seventh-floor corridor.\n\nHe skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed his eyes, and began to walk.\n\nI need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book. . . .\n\nThree times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door to the Room of Requirement. Harry wrenched it open, flung himself inside, and slammed it shut.\n\nHe gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden by castle-proud house-elves. There were thousands and thousands of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a heavy, bloodstained axe.\n\nHarry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboard\u2019s creaking doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed the Half-Blood Prince\u2019s book behind the cage and slammed the door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gazing around at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statue\u2019s head to make it more distinctive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor, where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back into stone.\n\nHarry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below, cramming Ron\u2019s copy of Advanced Potion-Making into his bag as he did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out his hand wordlessly for Harry\u2019s schoolbag. Harry handed it over, panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited.\n\nOne by one, Snape extracted Harry\u2019s books and examined them. Finally, the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked at very carefully before speaking.\n\n\u201cThis is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, still breathing hard.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, with a touch more defiance.\n\n\u201cThis is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry firmly.\n\n\u201cThen why,\u201d asked Snape, \u201cdoes it have the name \u2018Roonil Wazlib\u2019 written inside the front cover?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart missed a beat. \u201cThat\u2019s my nickname,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYour nickname,\u201d repeated Snape.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . that\u2019s what my friends call me,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI understand what a nickname is,\u201d said Snape. The cold, black eyes were boring once more into Harry\u2019s; he tried not to look into them. Close your mind. . . . Close your mind. . . . But he had never learned how to do it properly. . . .\n\n\u201cDo you know what I think, Potter?\u201d said Snape, very quietly. \u201cI think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. What do you think, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I don\u2019t agree, sir,\u201d said Harry, still refusing to look into Snape\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cWell, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,\u201d said Snape. \u201cTen o\u2019clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut sir . . .\u201d said Harry, looking up desperately. \u201cQuidditch . . . the last match of the . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTen o\u2019clock,\u201d whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his yellow teeth. \u201cPoor Gryffindor . . . fourth place this year, I fear . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than Ron had ever felt in his life.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say \u2018I told you so,\u2019\u201d said Hermione, an hour later in the common room.\n\n\u201cLeave it, Hermione,\u201d said Ron angrily.\n\nHarry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He had just finished telling Ron, Hermione, and Ginny what had happened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened. Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snape\u2019s punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term.\n\n\u201cI told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,\u201d Hermione said, evidently unable to stop herself. \u201cAnd I was right, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you were,\u201d said Harry stubbornly.\n\nHe was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him; the looks on the Gryffindor team\u2019s faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all. He could feel Ginny\u2019s eyes on him now but did not meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or anger there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up during the post-match euphoria. . . . The thought went through Harry like an icy knife. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow can you still stick up for that book when that spell \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you stop harping on about the book!\u201d snapped Harry. \u201cThe Prince only copied it out! It\u2019s not like he was advising anyone to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that had been used against him!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cYou\u2019re actually defending \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not defending what I did!\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t done it, and not just because I\u2019ve got about a dozen detentions. You know I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve used a spell like that, not even on Malfoy, but you can\u2019t blame the Prince, he hadn\u2019t written \u2018try this out, it\u2019s really good\u2019 \u2014 he was just making notes for himself, wasn\u2019t he, not for anyone else. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you telling me,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cthat you\u2019re going to go back \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd get the book? Yeah, I am,\u201d said Harry forcefully. \u201cListen, without the Prince I\u2019d never have won the Felix Felicis. I\u2019d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I\u2019d never have \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don\u2019t deserve,\u201d said Hermione nastily.\n\n\u201cGive it a rest, Hermione!\u201d said Ginny, and Harry was so amazed, so grateful, he looked up. \u201cBy the sound of it, Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course I\u2019m glad Harry wasn\u2019t cursed!\u201d said Hermione, clearly stung. \u201cBut you can\u2019t call that Sectumsempra spell good, Ginny, look where it\u2019s landed him! And I\u2019d have thought, seeing what this has done to your chances in the match \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t start acting as though you understand Quidditch,\u201d snapped Ginny, \u201cyou\u2019ll only embarrass yourself.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening.\n\nHis lightheartedness was short-lived. There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others. It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan.\n\n\u201cAh, Potter,\u201d said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about them.\n\n\u201cMr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files,\u201d said Snape softly. \u201cThey are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes. You will not use magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, Professor,\u201d said Harry, with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables.\n\n\u201cI thought you could start,\u201d said Snape, a malicious smile on his lips, \u201cwith boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty-six. You will find some familiar names in there, which should add interest to the task. Here, you see . . .\u201d\n\nHe pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read, \u201c\u2018James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubrey\u2019s head twice normal size. Double detention.\u2019\u201d Snape sneered. \u201cIt must be such a comfort to think that, though they are gone, a record of their great achievements remains. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.\n\nIt was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius\u2019s names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have just started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . .\n\nHarry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been here for only half an hour . . . an hour . . . an hour and a half. . . .\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task, finally looked up at ten past one.\n\n\u201cI think that will do,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cMark the place you have reached. You will continue at ten o\u2019clock next Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\nHarry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape could change his mind, racing back up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch, but all was quiet. . . . It was over, then. . . .\n\nHe hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room.\n\n\u201cQuid agis?\u201d he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what he would find inside.\n\nHer expression was unreadable as she replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nAnd she swung forward.\n\nA roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands pulled him into the room.\n\n\u201cWe won!\u201d yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry. \u201cWe won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty! We won!\u201d\n\nHarry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her.\n\nAfter several long moments \u2014 or it might have been half an hour \u2014 or possibly several sunlit days \u2014 they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny\u2019s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry\u2019s eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Well \u2014 if you must.\n\nThe creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which \u2014 if they had time \u2014 they might discuss the match."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter25": "THE SEER OVERHEARD\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time, rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark Magic.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think people had better things to gossip about,\u201d said Ginny, as she sat on the common room floor, leaning against Harry\u2019s legs and reading the Daily Prophet. \u201cThree dementor attacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it\u2019s true you\u2019ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored them.\n\n\u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told her it\u2019s a Hungarian Horntail,\u201d said Ginny, turning a page of the newspaper idly. \u201cMuch more macho.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, grinning. \u201cAnd what did you tell her Ron\u2019s got?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Pygmy Puff, but I didn\u2019t say where.\u201d\n\nRon scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing.\n\n\u201cWatch it,\u201d he said, pointing warningly at Harry and Ginny. \u201cJust because I\u2019ve given my permission doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t withdraw it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Your permission,\u2019\u201d scoffed Ginny. \u201cSince when did you give me permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself you\u2019d rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I would,\u201d said Ron grudgingly. \u201cAnd just as long as you don\u2019t start snogging each other in public \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place?\u201d demanded Ginny.\n\nBut Ron\u2019s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into June, for Harry and Ginny\u2019s time together was becoming increasingly restricted. Ginny\u2019s O.W.L.s were approaching and she was therefore forced to study for hours into the night. On one such evening, when Ginny had retired to the library, and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunchtime, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.\n\n\u201cI want to talk to you, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day, Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations.\n\n\u201cThe so-called Half-Blood Prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, not again,\u201d he groaned. \u201cWill you please drop it?\u201d\n\nHe had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffering accordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince\u2019s book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not dropping it,\u201d said Hermione firmly, \u201cuntil you\u2019ve heard me out. Now, I\u2019ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t make a hobby of it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe, he \u2014 who says it\u2019s a he?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this,\u201d said Harry crossly. \u201cPrince, Hermione, Prince!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight!\u201d said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry. \u201cLook at that! Look at the picture!\u201d\n\nHarry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face. Underneath the photograph was the caption: EILEEN PRINCE, CAPTAIN OF THE HOGWARTS GOBSTONES TEAM.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.\n\n\u201cHer name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to say. He burst out laughing.\n\n\u201cNo way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think she was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why not? Harry, there aren\u2019t any real princes in the Wizarding world! It\u2019s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody\u2019s given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldn\u2019t it? No, listen! If, say, her father was a wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a \u2018half-blood Prince\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, Hermione, I can tell it\u2019s not a girl. I can just tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is that you don\u2019t think a girl would have been clever enough,\u201d said Hermione angrily.\n\n\u201cHow can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?\u201d said Harry, stung by this. \u201cIt\u2019s the way he writes, I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn\u2019t got anything to do with it. Where did you get this anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe library,\u201d said Hermione predictably. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole collection of old Prophets up there. Well, I\u2019m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnjoy yourself,\u201d said Harry irritably.\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd the first place I\u2019ll look,\u201d she shot at him, as she reached the portrait hole, \u201cis records of old Potions awards!\u201d\n\nHarry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,\u201d said Ron, returning to his copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m mad, wanting that book back, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course not,\u201d said Ron robustly. \u201cHe was a genius, the Prince. Anyway . . . without his bezoar tip . . .\u201d He drew his finger significantly across his own throat. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here to discuss it, would I? I mean, I\u2019m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNor am I,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cBut he healed all right, didn\u2019t he? Back on his feet in no time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his conscience squirmed slightly all the same. \u201cThanks to Snape . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still got detention with Snape this Saturday?\u201d Ron continued.\n\n\u201cYeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,\u201d sighed Harry. \u201cAnd he\u2019s hinting now that if I don\u2019t get all the boxes done by the end of term, we\u2019ll carry on next year.\u201d\n\nHe was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny. Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later every time, while making pointed asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.\n\nHarry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of parchment.\n\n\u201cThanks, Jimmy . . . Hey, it\u2019s from Dumbledore!\u201d said Harry excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning it. \u201cHe wants me to go to his office as quick as I can!\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other.\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d whispered Ron. \u201cYou don\u2019t reckon . . . he hasn\u2019t found . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter go and see, hadn\u2019t I?\u201d said Harry, jumping to his feet.\n\nHe hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry\u2019s defensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people had already returned to their common rooms.\n\nAnd then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his tracks, listening.\n\n\u201cHow \u2014 dare \u2014 you \u2014 aaaaargh!\u201d\n\nThe noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted toward it, his wand at the ready, hurtled around another corner, and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head covered in one of her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken.\n\n\u201cProfessor \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry hurried forward and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet. Some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses. She hiccuped loudly, patted her hair, and pulled herself up on Harry\u2019s helping arm.\n\n\u201cWhat happened, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may well ask!\u201d she said shrilly. \u201cI was strolling along, brooding upon certain dark portents I happen to have glimpsed . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry was not paying much attention. He had just noticed where they were standing: There on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls, and on the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed \u2014\n\n\u201cProfessor, were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement?\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . omens I have been vouchsafed \u2014 what?\u201d She looked suddenly shifty.\n\n\u201cThe Room of Requirement,\u201d repeated Harry. \u201cWere you trying to get in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 well \u2014 I didn\u2019t know students knew about \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all of them do,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut what happened? You screamed. . . . It sounded as though you were hurt. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 well,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes. \u201cI wished to \u2014 ah \u2014 deposit certain \u2014 um \u2014 personal items in the room. . . .\u201d And she muttered something about \u201cnasty accusations.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. \u201cBut you couldn\u2019t get in and hide them?\u201d\n\nHe found this very odd; the room had opened for him, after all, when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood Prince\u2019s book.\n\n\u201cOh, I got in all right,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the wall. \u201cBut there was somebody already in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody in \u2014 ? Who?\u201d demanded Harry. \u201cWho was in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harry\u2019s voice. \u201cI walked into the room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding \u2014 of using the room, I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cA voice? Saying what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it was saying anything,\u201d said Professor Trelawney. \u201cIt was . . . whooping.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhooping?\u201d\n\n\u201cGleefully,\u201d she said, nodding.\n\nHarry stared at her.\n\n\u201cWas it male or female?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hazard a guess at male,\u201d said Professor Trelawney.\n\n\u201cAnd it sounded happy?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery happy,\u201d said Professor Trelawney sniffily.\n\n\u201cAs though it was celebrating?\u201d\n\n\u201cMost definitely.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then I called out \u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have found out who it was without asking?\u201d Harry asked her, slightly frustrated.\n\n\u201cThe Inner Eye,\u201d said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, \u201cwas fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor Trelawney\u2019s Inner Eye all too often before. \u201cAnd did the voice say who was there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it did not,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything went pitch-black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the room!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see that coming?\u201d said Harry, unable to help himself.\n\n\u201cNo, I did not, as I say, it was pitch \u2014\u201d She stopped and glared at him suspiciously.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019d better tell Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe ought to know Malfoy\u2019s celebrating \u2014 I mean, that someone threw you out of the room.\u201d\n\nTo his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion, looking haughty.\n\n\u201cThe headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cI am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show \u2014\u201d Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harry\u2019s wrist. \u201cAgain and again, no matter how I lay them out \u2014\u201d And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls. \u201c\u2014 the lightning-struck tower,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCalamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry again. \u201cWell . . . I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice, and everything going dark and being thrown out of the room. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to see him right now,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve got a meeting with him. We could go together.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, in that case,\u201d said Professor Trelawney with a smile. She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles, and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue-and-white vase standing in a nearby niche.\n\n\u201cI miss having you in my classes, Harry,\u201d she said soulfully as they set off together. \u201cYou were never much of a Seer . . . but you were a wonderful Object . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Professor Trelawney\u2019s continual predictions of doom.\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d she went on, \u201cthat the nag \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, the centaur \u2014 knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him \u2014 one Seer to another \u2014 had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes, comical!\u201d\n\nHer voice rose rather hysterically, and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great-great-grandmother\u2019s gift. Those rumors have been bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved myself to him?\u201d\n\nHarry mumbled something indistinct.\n\n\u201cI well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,\u201d went on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. \u201cHe was deeply impressed, of course, deeply impressed. . . . I was staying at the Hog\u2019s Head, which I do not advise, incidentally \u2014 bedbugs, dear boy \u2014 but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room. He questioned me. . . . I must confess that, at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed toward Divination . . . and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten much that day . . . but then . . .\u201d\n\nAnd now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time, for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the prophecy about him and Voldemort.\n\n\u201c. . . but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open, and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape, who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs, although I\u2019m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore \u2014 you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, compared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes \u2014 Harry, dear?\u201d\n\nShe looked back over her shoulder, having only just realized that Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d she repeated uncertainly.\n\nPerhaps his face was white to make her look so concerned and frightened. Harry was standing stock-still as waves of shock crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long. . . .\n\nIt was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their son. . . .\n\nNothing else mattered to Harry just now.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d said Professor Trelawney again. \u201cHarry \u2014 I thought we were going to see the headmaster together?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stay here,\u201d said Harry through numb lips.\n\n\u201cBut dear . . . I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stay here!\u201d Harry repeated angrily.\n\nShe looked alarmed as he ran past her, around the corner into Dumbledore\u2019s corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry. Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dumbledore\u2019s door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered, \u201cEnter\u201d after Harry had already flung himself into the room.\n\nFawkes the phoenix looked around, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the windows. Dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a long, black traveling cloak in his arms.\n\n\u201cWell, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.\u201d\n\nFor a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the conversation with Trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly.\n\n\u201cCome . . . with you . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if you wish it, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledore\u2019s office in the first place. \u201cYou\u2019ve found one? You\u2019ve found a Horcrux?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe so.\u201d\n\nRage and resentment fought shock and excitement: For several moments, Harry could not speak.\n\n\u201cIt is natural to be afraid,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not scared!\u201d said Harry at once, and it was perfectly true; fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. \u201cWhich Horcrux is it? Where is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not sure which it is \u2014 though I think we can rule out the snake \u2014 but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHow is it protected?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.\u201d Dumbledore hesitated, then said, \u201cHarry, I promised you that you could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had finished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes. This seemed to show on Harry\u2019s face, for Dumbledore moved away from the window and looked more closely at Harry, a slight crease between his silver eyebrows.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d lied Harry promptly.\n\n\u201cWhat has upset you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you were never a good Occlumens \u2014\u201d\n\nThe word was the spark that ignited Harry\u2019s fury.\n\n\u201cSnape!\u201d he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them. \u201cSnape\u2019s what\u2019s happened! He told Voldemort about the prophecy, it was him, he listened outside the door, Trelawney told me!\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s expression did not change, but Harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. For a long moment, Dumbledore said nothing. \u201cWhen did you find out about this?\u201d he asked at last.\n\n\u201cJust now!\u201d said Harry, who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, he could not stop himself. \u201cAND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!\u201d\n\nBreathing hard as though he was fighting, Harry turned away from Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over. He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore, but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting Snape, but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cPlease listen to me.\u201d\n\nIt was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumbledore\u2019s lined face.\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape made a terrible \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease let me finish.\u201d Dumbledore waited until Harry had nodded curtly, then went on. \u201cProfessor Snape made a terrible mistake. He was still in Lord Voldemort\u2019s employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawney\u2019s prophecy. Naturally, he hastened to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most deeply. But he did not know \u2014 he had no possible way of knowing \u2014 which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward, or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry let out a yell of mirthless laughter.\n\n\u201cHe hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven\u2019t you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy, Harry. I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s a very good Occlumens, isn\u2019t he, sir?\u201d said Harry, whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t Voldemort convinced that Snape\u2019s on his side, even now? Professor . . . how can you be sure Snape\u2019s on our side?\u201d\n\nDumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something. At last he said, \u201cI am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.\u201d\n\nHarry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself. It did not work.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t!\u201d he said, as loudly as before. \u201cHe\u2019s up to something with Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you still \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have discussed this, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, and now he sounded stern again. \u201cI have told you my views.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving the school tonight, and I\u2019ll bet you haven\u2019t even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what?\u201d asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. \u201cWhat is it that you suspect them of doing, precisely?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . they\u2019re up to something!\u201d said Harry, and his hands curled into fists as he said it. \u201cProfessor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Malfoy whooping, celebrating! He\u2019s trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me, he\u2019s fixed it at last and you\u2019re about to just walk out of school without \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. \u201cDo you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore cut across him.\n\n\u201cI do not wish to discuss the matter any further.\u201d\n\nHarry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he had ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore, but Dumbledore went on, \u201cDo you wish to come with me tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry at once.\n\n\u201cVery well, then: Listen.\u201d Dumbledore drew himself up to his full height. \u201cI take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you must follow even such orders as \u2018run,\u2019 \u2018hide,\u2019 or \u2018go back.\u2019 Do I have your word?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 yes, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I tell you to hide, you will do so?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I tell you to flee, you will obey?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I tell you to leave me and save yourself, you will do as I tell you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other for a moment.\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Invisibility Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nDumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the sun was now a ruby red glare along the horizon. Harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do.\n\nRon and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back. \u201cWhat does he want?\u201d Hermione said at once. \u201cHarry, are you okay?\u201d she added anxiously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauder\u2019s Map and a pair of balled-up socks. Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room, skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to be quick,\u201d Harry panted. \u201cDumbledore thinks I\u2019m getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen. . . .\u201d\n\nQuickly he told them where he was going and why. He did not pause either for Hermione\u2019s gasps of horror or for Ron\u2019s hasty questions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later.\n\n\u201c. . . so you see what this means?\u201d Harry finished at a gallop. \u201cDumbledore won\u2019t be here tonight, so Malfoy\u2019s going to have another clear shot at whatever he\u2019s up to. No, listen to me!\u201d he hissed angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting. \u201cI know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement. Here \u2014\u201d He shoved the Marauder\u2019s Map into Hermione\u2019s hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to watch him and you\u2019ve got to watch Snape too. Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the D.A., Hermione, those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says he\u2019s put extra protection in the school, but if Snape\u2019s involved, he\u2019ll know what Dumbledore\u2019s protection is, and how to avoid it \u2014 but he won\u2019t be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014\u201d began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got time to argue,\u201d said Harry curtly. \u201cTake this as well \u2014\u201d\n\nHe thrust the socks into Ron\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Ron. \u201cEr \u2014 why do I need socks?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need what\u2019s wrapped in them, it\u2019s the Felix Felicis. Share it between yourselves and Ginny too. Say good-bye to her for me. I\u2019d better go, Dumbledore\u2019s waiting \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion, looking awestruck. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it, you take it, who knows what you\u2019re going to be facing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019ll be with Dumbledore,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI want to know you lot are okay. . . . Don\u2019t look like that, Hermione, I\u2019ll see you later. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole and toward the entrance hall.\n\nDumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He turned as Harry came skidding out onto the topmost stone step, panting hard, a searing stitch in his side.\n\n\u201cI would like you to wear your Cloak, please,\u201d said Dumbledore, and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, \u201cVery good. Shall we go?\u201d\n\nDumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own traveling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still panting and sweating rather a lot.\n\n\u201cBut what will people think when they see you leaving, Professor?\u201d Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape.\n\n\u201cThat I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,\u201d said Dumbledore lightly. \u201cI sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog\u2019s Head . . . or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one\u2019s true destination.\u201d\n\nThey made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight. The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water, and wood smoke from Hagrid\u2019s cabin. It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view, \u201cwill we be Apparating?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYou can Apparate now, I believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t got a license.\u201d\n\nHe felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go?\n\n\u201cNo matter,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cI can assist you again.\u201d\n\nThey turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked, and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest. Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and stay out!\u201d shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a grubby-looking wizard. \u201cOh, hello, Albus . . . You\u2019re out late . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Rosmerta, good evening . . . forgive me, I\u2019m off to the Hog\u2019s Head. . . . No offense, but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight. . . .\u201d\n\nA minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog\u2019s Head\u2019s sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze. In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be completely empty.\n\n\u201cIt will not be necessary for us to enter,\u201d muttered Dumbledore, glancing around. \u201cAs long as nobody sees us go . . . now place your hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am merely guiding you. On the count of three . . . One . . . two . . . three . . .\u201d\n\nHarry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw breath, every part of him was being compressed almost past endurance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the invisible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter26": "THE CAVE\n\n\n\n\nHarry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asked Dumbledore. He might have been asking Harry\u2019s opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic.\n\n\u201cThey brought the kids from the orphanage here?\u201d asked Harry, who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip.\n\n\u201cNot here, precisely,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThere is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps.\n\n\u201cBut his final destination \u2014 and ours \u2014 lies a little farther on. Come.\u201d\n\nDumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face.\n\n\u201cLumos,\u201d said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too.\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling.\n\n\u201cYou will not object to getting a little wet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThen take off your Invisibility Cloak \u2014 there is no need for it now \u2014 and let us take the plunge.\u201d\n\nAnd with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his Cloak, stuffed it into his pocket, and followed.\n\nThe water was icy; Harry\u2019s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff.\n\nThe fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledore\u2019s wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued to swim in Dumbledore\u2019s wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough, wet rock.\n\nThen he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his silver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them, water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air.\n\nDumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and ceiling.\n\n\u201cYes, this is the place,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d Harry spoke in a whisper.\n\n\u201cIt has known magic,\u201d said Dumbledore simply.\n\nHarry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see.\n\n\u201cThis is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,\u201d said Dumbledore after a moment or two. \u201cWe need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemort\u2019s obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made. . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the wall.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe go on through here. The entrance is concealed.\u201d\n\nHarry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.\n\nDumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there, blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve d-done it!\u201d said Harry through chattering teeth, but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around.\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m so sorry, I forgot,\u201d he said; he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once, Harry\u2019s clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledore\u2019s concentration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly, \u201cOh, surely not. So crude.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cI rather think,\u201d said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients, \u201cthat we are required to make payment to pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cPayment?\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the door something?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBlood, if I am not much mistaken.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlood?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said it was crude,\u201d said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore expected. \u201cThe idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . .\u201d said Harry, who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more.\n\n\u201cSometimes, however, it is unavoidable,\u201d said Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand.\n\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, I\u2019m \u2014\u201d\n\nHe did not know what he was going to say \u2014 younger, fitter? But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening drops.\n\n\u201cYou are very kind, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy\u2019s wounds. \u201cBut your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have done the trick, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more, and this time it did not fade away: The blood-spattered rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness.\n\n\u201cAfter me, I think,\u201d said Dumbledore, and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily as he went.\n\nAn eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness.\n\n\u201cLet us walk,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cBe very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.\u201d\n\nHe set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth, glassy blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving.\n\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d he said finally. \u201cDo you think the Horcrux is here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t . . . we couldn\u2019t just try a Summoning Charm?\u201d Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cCertainly we could,\u201d said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly that Harry almost walked into him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? Oh . . . okay . . .\u201d\n\nHarry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said loudly, wand aloft, \u201cAccio Horcrux!\u201d\n\nWith a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.\u201d\n\nHarry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally fast; Harry\u2019s heart, however, was still pounding.\n\n\u201cDid you think that would happen, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t know what the thing was,\u201d said Harry, looking at the sinisterly smooth water.\n\n\u201cWhat the things are, you mean,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think we\u2019re going to have to go into the lake?\u201d\n\n\u201cInto it? Only if we are very unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no . . . I think the Horcrux is in the middle.\u201d\n\nAnd Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d\n\nHarry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water monsters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . .\n\n\u201cAha,\u201d said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water, and Dumbledore\u2019s uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm, pulling him back. \u201cSo sorry, Harry, I should have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I have found the place.\u201d\n\nHarry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it. This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but through the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip something invisible.\n\n\u201cOho,\u201d said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumbledore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore\u2019s buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.\n\nImmediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore\u2019s clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood.\n\n\u201cHow did you know that was there?\u201d Harry asked in astonishment.\n\n\u201cMagic always leaves traces,\u201d said Dumbledore, as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, \u201csometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs . . . is this boat safe?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the things in the water won\u2019t do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort\u2019s boat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however, we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why have they let us?\u201d asked Harry, who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank.\n\n\u201cVoldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he is right.\u201d\n\nHarry looked down into the boat. It really was very small.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?\u201d\n\nDumbledore chuckled.\n\n\u201cVoldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.\u201d\n\nThese words did nothing to raise Harry\u2019s morale; perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, \u201cVoldemort\u2019s mistake, Harry, Voldemort\u2019s mistake . . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.\u201d\n\nDumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor. They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit, but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which began to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat\u2019s prow cleaving the water; it moved without their help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no waves.\n\nHarry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the dark mirror. . . .\n\nAnd then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the surface.\n\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I saw a hand in the water \u2014 a human hand!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am sure you did,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly.\n\nHarry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat.\n\n\u201cSo that thing that jumped out of the water \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke.\n\n\u201cThere are bodies in here!\u201d said Harry, and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore placidly, \u201cbut we do not need to worry about them at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the moment?\u201d Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cNot while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThere is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not dangerous.\n\n\u201cBut one of them jumped,\u201d he said, trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledore\u2019s. \u201cWhen I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI am sure that once we take the Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise. Fire, Harry,\u201d Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to Harry\u2019s bewildered expression.\n\n\u201cOh . . . right . . .\u201d said Harry quickly. He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great black lake, teeming with the dead . . . It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a better good-bye to them . . . and he hadn\u2019t seen Ginny at all. . . .\n\n\u201cNearly there,\u201d said Dumbledore cheerfully.\n\nSure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake.\n\n\u201cCareful not to touch the water,\u201d said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat.\n\nThe island was no larger than Dumbledore\u2019s office, an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to. Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal.\n\nDumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Harry quietly.\n\n\u201cI am not sure,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cSomething more worrisome than blood and bodies, however.\u201d\n\nDumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion.\n\n\u201cSir, no, don\u2019t touch \u2014 !\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot touch,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. \u201cSee? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.\u201d\n\nStaring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and inflexible air.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, please, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. He raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except perhaps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again.\n\n\u201cYou think the Horcrux is in there, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes.\u201d Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin. Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of the green potion. \u201cBut how to reach it? This potion cannot be penetrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away, nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change its nature.\u201d\n\nAlmost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere.\n\n\u201cI can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what if \u2014 what if it kills you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I doubt that it would work like that,\u201d said Dumbledore easily. \u201cLord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island.\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore\u2019s insane determination to see good in everyone?\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, \u201csir, this is Voldemort we\u2019re \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island,\u201d Dumbledore corrected himself. \u201cHe would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.\u201d\n\nHarry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d he said, finally, \u201cthis potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me, cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am distracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking, even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You understand?\u201d\n\nTheir eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange, green light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited along \u2014 so that he could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain?\n\n\u201cYou remember,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cthe condition on which I brought you with me?\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin.\n\n\u201cBut what if \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, \u201cyou have my orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I drink the potion instead?\u201d asked Harry desperately.\n\n\u201cBecause I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cOnce and for all, Harry, do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking?\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I have it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour word, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 all right, but \u2014\u201d\n\nBefore Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth.\n\n\u201cYour good health, Harry.\u201d\n\nAnd he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb.\n\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\nDumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered whether he was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more.\n\nIn silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion. Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell forward against the basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing heavy.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore?\u201d said Harry, his voice strained. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d\n\nDumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it. Harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady.\n\n\u201cProfessor, can you hear me?\u201d he repeated loudly, his voice echoing around the cavern.\n\nDumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want . . . Don\u2019t make me . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what to do.\n\n\u201c. . . don\u2019t like . . . want to stop . . .\u201d moaned Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYou . . . you can\u2019t stop, Professor,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking. Here . . .\u201d\n\nHating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced the goblet back toward Dumbledore\u2019s mouth and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside.\n\n\u201cNo . . .\u201d he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to. . . . I don\u2019t want to. . . . Let me go. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Professor,\u201d said Harry, his hand shaking. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, I\u2019m here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it stop, make it stop,\u201d moaned Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYes . . . yes, this\u2019ll make it stop,\u201d lied Harry. He tipped the contents of the goblet into Dumbledore\u2019s open mouth.\n\nDumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast chamber, across the dead black water.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, no, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, don\u2019t make me, I don\u2019t want to. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Professor, it\u2019s all right!\u201d said Harry loudly, his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion; the basin was now half empty. \u201cNothing\u2019s happening to you, you\u2019re safe, it isn\u2019t real, I swear it isn\u2019t real \u2014 take this, now, take this. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an antidote Harry offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, all my fault,\u201d he sobbed. \u201cPlease make it stop, I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and I\u2019ll never, never again . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will make it stop, Professor,\u201d Harry said, his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into Dumbledore\u2019s mouth.\n\nDumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from Harry\u2019s trembling hands as he moaned, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt them, don\u2019t hurt them, please, please, it\u2019s my fault, hurt me instead . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, drink this, drink this, you\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Harry desperately, and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot.\n\nAnd now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists upon the ground, while Harry filled the ninth goblet.\n\n\u201cPlease, please, please, no . . . not that, not that, I\u2019ll do anything . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cJust drink, Professor, just drink . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had finished, he yelled again as though his insides were on fire. \u201cNo more, please, no more . . .\u201d\n\nHarry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. . . .\u201d\n\nHe supported Dumbledore\u2019s shoulders and again, Dumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was on his feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever, \u201cI want to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want to die!\u201d\n\n\u201cDrink this, Professor. Drink this. . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished than he yelled, \u201cKILL ME!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis \u2014 this one will!\u201d gasped Harry. \u201cJust drink this . . . It\u2019ll be over . . . all over!\u201d\n\nDumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back; Dumbledore\u2019s glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, \u201cno, you\u2019re not dead, you said it wasn\u2019t poison, wake up, wake up \u2014 Rennervate!\u201d he cried, his wand pointing at Dumbledore\u2019s chest; there was a flash of red light but nothing happened. \u201cRennervate \u2014 sir \u2014 please \u2014\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s eyelids flickered; Harry\u2019s heart leapt.\n\n\u201cSir, are you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWater,\u201d croaked Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWater,\u201d panted Harry. \u201cYes \u2014\u201d\n\nHe leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin; he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it.\n\n\u201cAguamenti!\u201d he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand.\n\nThe goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his lips \u2014 but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.\n\n\u201cBut I had some \u2014 wait \u2014 Aguamenti!\u201d said Harry again, pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledore\u2019s mouth, the water vanished again.\n\n\u201cSir, I\u2019m trying, I\u2019m trying!\u201d said Harry desperately, but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. \u201cAguamenti \u2014 Aguamenti \u2014 AGUAMENTI!\u201d\n\nThe goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumbledore\u2019s breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Voldemort had planned it so . . .\n\nHe flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish.\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 here!\u201d Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledore\u2019s face.\n\nIt was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock. The surface of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning, and everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken, sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead rising from the black water.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm: It released him, falling backward into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him, trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d Harry bellowed again, backing away as he swiped his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled, but more were coming toward him. \u201cImpedimenta! Incarcerous!\u201d\n\nA few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes, but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry yelled, \u201cSectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!\u201d\n\nBut though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, and he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemort\u2019s shattered soul. . . .\n\nBut then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold, a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, but scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around.\n\nDumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth.\n\nThe Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to escape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . .\n\nDumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the water\u2019s edge, where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.\n\nHarry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire, and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d panted Harry, \u201csir, I forgot \u2014 about fire \u2014 they were coming at me and I panicked \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite understandable,\u201d murmured Dumbledore. Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was.\n\nThey reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall.\n\n\u201cI am weak. . . .\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sir,\u201d said Harry at once, anxious about Dumbledore\u2019s extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd pulling Dumbledore\u2019s uninjured arm around his shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of his weight.\n\n\u201cThe protection was . . . after all . . . well-designed,\u201d said Dumbledore faintly. \u201cOne alone could not have done it. . . . You did well, very well, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk now,\u201d said Harry, fearing how slurred Dumbledore\u2019s voice had become, how much his feet dragged. \u201cSave your energy, sir. . . . We\u2019ll soon be out of here. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need, I got cut on the rock,\u201d said Harry firmly. \u201cJust tell me where. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHere . . .\u201d\n\nHarry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having received its tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right, sir,\u201d Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore\u2019s silence than he had been by his weakened voice. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly there. . . . I can Apparate us both back. . . . Don\u2019t worry. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not worried, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \u201cI am with you.\u201d"}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter27": "THE LIGHTNING-STRUCK TOWER\n\n\n\n\nOnce back under the starry sky, Harry heaved Dumbledore onto the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet. Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore\u2019s weight still upon him, Harry concentrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination: Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore\u2019s arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forward into that feeling of horrible compression.\n\nHe knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: The smell of salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade. For one horrible moment Harry\u2019s imagination showed him more Inferi creeping toward him around the sides of shops, but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring; all was still, the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.\n\n\u201cWe did it, Professor!\u201d Harry whispered with difficulty; he suddenly realized that he had a searing stitch in his chest. \u201cWe did it! We got the Horcrux!\u201d\n\nDumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp.\n\n\u201cSir, are you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been better,\u201d said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners of his mouth twitched. \u201cThat potion . . . was no health drink. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd to Harry\u2019s horror, Dumbledore sank onto the ground.\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 it\u2019s okay, sir, you\u2019re going to be all right, don\u2019t worry \u2014\u201d\n\nHe looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing.\n\n\u201cWe need to get you up to the school, sir. . . . Madam Pomfrey . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cIt is . . . Professor Snape whom I need. . . . But I do not think . . . I can walk very far just yet. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRight \u2014 sir, listen \u2014 I\u2019m going to knock on a door, find a place you can stay \u2014 then I can run and get Madam \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSeverus,\u201d said Dumbledore clearly. \u201cI need Severus. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right then, Snape \u2014 but I\u2019m going to have to leave you for a moment so I can \u2014\u201d\n\nBefore Harry could make a move, however, he heard running footsteps. His heart leapt: Somebody had seen, somebody knew they needed help \u2014 and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street toward them on high-heeled, fluffy slippers, wearing a silk dressing gown embroidered with dragons.\n\n\u201cI saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains! Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn\u2019t think what to \u2014 but what\u2019s wrong with Albus?\u201d\n\nShe came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s hurt,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMadam Rosmerta, can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go up there alone! Don\u2019t you realize \u2014 haven\u2019t you seen \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you help me support him,\u201d said Harry, not listening to her, \u201cI think we can get him inside \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d asked Dumbledore. \u201cRosmerta, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2014 the Dark Mark, Albus.\u201d\n\nAnd she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts. Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words. . . . He turned and looked.\n\nThere it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building . . . wherever they had murdered. . . .\n\n\u201cWhen did it appear?\u201d asked Dumbledore, and his hand clenched painfully upon Harry\u2019s shoulder as he struggled to his feet.\n\n\u201cMust have been minutes ago, it wasn\u2019t there when I put the cat out, but when I got upstairs \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to return to the castle at once,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cRosmerta\u201d \u2014 and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly in command of the situation \u2014 \u201cwe need transport \u2014 brooms \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple behind the bar,\u201d she said, looking very frightened. \u201cShall I run and fetch \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Harry can do it.\u201d\n\nHarry raised his wand at once.\n\n\u201cAccio Rosmerta\u2019s Brooms!\u201d\n\nA second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harry\u2019s side, where they stopped dead, quivering slightly at waist height.\n\n\u201cRosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,\u201d said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. \u201cIt might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. . . . Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.\u201d\n\nHarry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom: Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped toward the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: He was bent low over his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air. And Harry too looked ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from his mind. . . .\n\nHow long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione, and Ginny\u2019s luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or some other member of the D.A.? And if it was . . . he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds. . . . Would he be responsible, again, for the death of a friend?\n\nAs they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again. He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did that mean the death had occurred there?\n\nDumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around.\n\nThe ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle, of a fight to the death, of a body.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at the green skull with its serpent\u2019s tongue glinting evilly above them. \u201cIs it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been \u2014 Professor?\u201d\n\nIn the dim green glow from the Mark, Harry saw Dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand.\n\n\u201cGo and wake Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore faintly but clearly. \u201cTell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do nothing else, speak to nobody else, and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou swore to obey me, Harry \u2014 go!\u201d\n\nHarry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase, but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked around at Dumbledore, who gestured him to retreat. Harry backed away, drawing his wand as he did so.\n\nThe door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted, \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall, propped like an unsteady statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it had happened \u2014 Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm \u2014\n\nThen, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore\u2019s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood. . . . Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilized Harry, and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself.\n\nStanding against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked across at his disarmer and said, \u201cGood evening, Draco.\u201d\n\nMalfoy stepped forward, glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second broom.\n\n\u201cWho else is here?\u201d\n\n\u201cA question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?\u201d\n\nHarry saw Malfoy\u2019s pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got backup. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was showing him an ambitious homework project. \u201cVery good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Malfoy, who was panting. \u201cRight under your nose and you never realized!\u201d\n\n\u201cIngenious,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYet . . . forgive me . . . where are they now? You seem unsupported.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey met some of your guards. They\u2019re having a fight down below. They won\u2019t be long. . . . I came on ahead. I \u2014 I\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,\u201d said Dumbledore softly.\n\nThere was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralyzed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters\u2019 distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore, who, incredibly, smiled.\n\n\u201cDraco, Draco, you are not a killer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d said Malfoy at once.\n\nHe seemed to realize how childish the words had sounded; Harry saw him flush in the Mark\u2019s greenish light.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m capable of,\u201d said Malfoy more forcefully. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, I do,\u201d said Dumbledore mildly. \u201cYou almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts. . . . So feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been in it!\u201d said Malfoy vehemently. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on it all year, and tonight \u2014\u201d\n\nSomewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cSomebody is putting up a good fight,\u201d said Dumbledore conversationally. \u201cBut you were saying . . . yes, you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school, which, I admit, I thought impossible. . . . How did you do it?\u201d\n\nBut Malfoy said nothing: He was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralyzed as Harry was.\n\n\u201cPerhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,\u201d suggested Dumbledore. \u201cWhat if your backup has been thwarted by my guard? As you have perhaps realized, there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight too. And after all, you don\u2019t really need help. . . . I have no wand at the moment. . . . I cannot defend myself.\u201d\n\nMalfoy merely stared at him.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke. \u201cYou are afraid to act until they join you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid!\u201d snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore. \u201cIt\u2019s you who should be scared!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why? I don\u2019t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe. . . . So tell me, while we wait for your friends . . . how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.\u201d\n\nMalfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glaring at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter\u2019s heart. Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, \u201cI had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one\u2019s used for years. The one Montague got lost in last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cAaaah.\u201d Dumbledore\u2019s sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes for a moment. \u201cThat was clever. . . . There is a pair, I take it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Borgin and Burkes,\u201d said Malfoy, \u201cand they make a kind of passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was going on in the shop, as if the cabinet was traveling between them, but he couldn\u2019t make anyone hear him. . . . In the end, he managed to Apparate out, even though he\u2019d never passed his test. He nearly died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was the only one who realized what it meant \u2014 even Borgin didn\u2019t know \u2014 I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hogwarts through the cabinets if I fixed the broken one.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d murmured Dumbledore. \u201cSo the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you. . . . A clever plan, a very clever plan . . . and, as you say, right under my nose.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Malfoy, who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledore\u2019s praise. \u201cYeah, it was!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there were times,\u201d Dumbledore went on, \u201cweren\u2019t there, when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands . . . poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, you still didn\u2019t realize who was behind that stuff, did you?\u201d sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry struggled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, I did,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI was sure it was you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop me, then?\u201d Malfoy demanded.\n\n\u201cI tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been doing your orders, he promised my mother \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a double agent, you stupid old man, he isn\u2019t working for you, you just think he is!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I trust Professor Snape \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re losing your grip, then!\u201d sneered Malfoy. \u201cHe\u2019s been offering me plenty of help \u2014 wanting all the glory for himself \u2014 wanting a bit of the action \u2014 \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u2018Did you do the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything \u2014\u2019 But I haven\u2019t told him what I\u2019ve been doing in the Room of Requirement, he\u2019s going to wake up tomorrow and it\u2019ll all be over and he won\u2019t be the Dark Lord\u2019s favorite anymore, he\u2019ll be nothing compared to me, nothing!\u201d\n\n\u201cVery gratifying,\u201d said Dumbledore mildly. \u201cWe all like appreciation for our own hard work, of course. But you must have had an accomplice, all the same . . . someone in Hogsmeade, someone who was able to slip Katie the \u2014 the \u2014 aaaah . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was about to fall asleep. \u201c. . . of course . . . Rosmerta. How long has she been under the Imperius Curse?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot there at last, have you?\u201d Malfoy taunted.\n\nThere was another yell from below, rather louder than the last. Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at Dumbledore, who went on: \u201cSo poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned mead . . . well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be my Christmas present. . . . Yes, very neat . . . very neat . . . Poor Mr. Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmerta\u2019s. Tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnchanted coins,\u201d said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to keep talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. \u201cI had one and she had the other and I could send her messages \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore\u2019s Army used last year?\u201d asked Dumbledore. His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it.\n\n\u201cYeah, I got the idea from them,\u201d said Malfoy, with a twisted smile. \u201cI got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognizing potions.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do not use that offensive word in front of me,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nMalfoy gave a harsh laugh. \u201cYou care about me saying \u2018Mudblood\u2019 when I\u2019m about to kill you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. \u201cBut as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now, we are quite alone, I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted. . . .\u201d\n\nMalfoy\u2019s mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted something very bitter.\n\n\u201cNow, about tonight,\u201d Dumbledore went on, \u201cI am a little puzzled about how it happened. . . . You knew that I had left the school? But of course,\u201d he answered his own question, \u201cRosmerta saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cBut she said you were just going for a drink, you\u2019d be back. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I certainly did have a drink . . . and I came back . . . after a fashion,\u201d mumbled Dumbledore. \u201cSo you decided to spring a trap for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and get you to hurry up here, to see who\u2019d been killed,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cAnd it worked!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . yes and no . . .\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut am I to take it, then, that nobody has been murdered?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s dead,\u201d said Malfoy, and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it. \u201cOne of your people . . . I don\u2019t know who, it was dark. . . . I stepped over the body. . . . I was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in the way. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they do that,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nThere was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy, and Harry stood, and Harry\u2019s heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest. . . . Someone was dead. . . . Malfoy had stepped over the body . . . but who was it?\n\n\u201cThere is little time, one way or another,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cSo let us discuss your options, Draco.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy options!\u201d said Malfoy loudly. \u201cI\u2019m standing here with a wand \u2014 I\u2019m about to kill you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear boy, let us have no more pretense about that. If you were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first disarmed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any options!\u201d said Malfoy, and he was suddenly white as Dumbledore. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do it! He\u2019ll kill me! He\u2019ll kill my whole family!\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate the difficulty of your position,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWhy else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I suspected you.\u201d\n\nMalfoy winced at the sound of the name.\n\n\u201cI did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,\u201d continued Dumbledore. \u201cBut now at last we can speak plainly to each other. . . . No harm has been done, you have hurt nobody, though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived. . . . I can help you, Draco.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly indeed. \u201cNobody can. He told me to do it or he\u2019ll kill me. I\u2019ve got no choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban. . . . When the time comes, we can protect him too. . . . Come over to the right side, Draco . . . you are not a killer. . . .\u201d\n\nMalfoy stared at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cBut I got this far, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThey thought I\u2019d die in the attempt, but I\u2019m here . . . and you\u2019re in my power. . . . I\u2019m the one with the wand. . . . You\u2019re at my mercy. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Draco,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cIt is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.\u201d\n\nMalfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction \u2014\n\nBut suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs, and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door onto the ramparts. Still paralyzed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers: It seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below.\n\nA lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle.\n\n\u201cDumbledore cornered!\u201d he said, and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly. \u201cDumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well done, Draco, well done!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Amycus,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly, as though welcoming the man to a tea party. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve brought Alecto too. . . . Charming . . .\u201d\n\nThe woman gave an angry little titter. \u201cThink your little jokes\u2019ll help you on your deathbed then?\u201d she jeered.\n\n\u201cJokes? No, no, these are manners,\u201d replied Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy man with matted gray hair and whiskers, whose black Death Eater\u2019s robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat, and, unmistakably, blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Fenrir?\u201d asked Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d rasped the other. \u201cPleased to see me, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I cannot say that I am.\u201d\n\nGreyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely.\n\n\u201cBut you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now? This is most unusual. . . . You have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Fenrir Greyback. \u201cShocks you that, does it, Dumbledore? Frightens you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Fenrir; he did not seem to want to even glance at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to come \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,\u201d rasped Greyback. \u201cNot when there are throats to be ripped out . . . Delicious, delicious . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth, leering at Dumbledore. \u201cI could do you for afters, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, brutal-looking face. \u201cWe\u2019ve got orders. Draco\u2019s got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.\u201d\n\nMalfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore\u2019s face, which was even paler, and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart wall.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!\u201d said the lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister\u2019s wheezing giggles. \u201cLook at him \u2014 what\u2019s happened to you, then, Dumby?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cOld age, in short . . . One day, perhaps, it will happen to you . . . if you are lucky. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean, then, what\u2019s that mean?\u201d yelled the Death Eater, suddenly violent. \u201cAlways the same, weren\u2019t yeh, Dumby, talking and doing nothing, nothing. I don\u2019t even know why the Dark Lord\u2019s bothering to kill yer! Come on, Draco, do it!\u201d\n\nBut at that moment there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted, \u201cThey\u2019ve blocked the stairs \u2014 Reducto! REDUCTO!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart leapt: So these four had not eliminated all opposition, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower, and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them \u2014\n\n\u201cNow, Draco, quickly!\u201d said the brutal-faced man angrily.\n\nBut Malfoy\u2019s hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d snarled Fenrir, moving toward Dumbledore with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared.\n\n\u201cI said no!\u201d shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harry\u2019s heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore\u2019s spell \u2014 if he could only move, he could aim a curse from under the Cloak \u2014\n\n\u201cDraco, do it or stand aside so one of us \u2014\u201d screeched the woman, but at that precise moment, the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem, Snape,\u201d said the lumpy Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, \u201cthe boy doesn\u2019t seem able \u2014\u201d\n\nBut somebody else had spoken Snape\u2019s name, quite softly.\n\n\u201cSeverus . . .\u201d\n\nThe sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading.\n\nSnape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.\n\nSnape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.\n\n\u201cSeverus . . . please . . .\u201d\n\nSnape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d\n\nA jet of green light shot from the end of Snape\u2019s wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry\u2019s scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backward, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter28": "FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE\n\n\n\n\nHarry felt as though he too were hurtling through space; it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. . . .\n\n\u201cOut of here, quickly,\u201d said Snape.\n\nHe seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they vanished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the brutal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing through the door.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d\n\nThe Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase.\n\nTerror tore at Harry\u2019s heart. . . . He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. . . . Somehow the two things were linked. . . . He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. . . . Dumbledore could not have died. . . .\n\nHe leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed, his wand raised: The dimly lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but even as he attempted to make out who was fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, \u201cIt\u2019s over, time to go!\u201d and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: It was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat \u2014\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d\n\nHarry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling, enjoying the sport: \u201cCrucio \u2014 Crucio \u2014 you can\u2019t dance forever, pretty \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cImpedimenta!\u201d yelled Harry.\n\nHis jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Beyond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they ricocheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the nearest window \u2014\n\n\u201cHarry, where did you come from?\u201d Ginny cried, but there was no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward, narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up with Snape \u2014\n\n\u201cTake that!\u201d shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and next moment he was lying across someone\u2019s legs. Looking around, he saw Neville\u2019s pale, round face flat against the floor.\n\n\u201cNeville, are you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cM\u2019all right,\u201d muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach, \u201cHarry . . . Snape \u2019n\u2019 Malfoy . . . ran past . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I\u2019m on it!\u201d said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face: He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . .\n\nHe skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood; Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet, his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors \u2014 perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked \u2014\n\nHe skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams; other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . .\n\nHe pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.\n\n\u201cHarry! We heard a noise, and someone said something about the Dark Mark \u2014\u201d began Ernie Macmillan.\n\n\u201cOut of the way!\u201d yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a loud rattle, onto the flagstones below.\n\nHarry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds: He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate \u2014 by the looks of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him, Snape and Malfoy . . .\n\nThe cold night air ripped at Harry\u2019s lungs as he tore after them; he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse \u2014\n\nAnother flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid . . . not Hagrid too . . .\n\nSomething caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him. . . .\n\n\u201cImpedimenta!\u201d he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape.\n\nAnd now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but Hagrid\u2019s immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him. Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, able to Disapparate \u2014\n\nHarry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape\u2019s back, and yelled, \u201cStupefy!\u201d\n\nHe missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape\u2019s head; Snape shouted, \u201cRun, Draco!\u201d and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.\n\n\u201cCruc \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, \u201cIncendio!\u201d Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them: Hagrid\u2019s house was on fire.\n\n\u201cFang\u2019s in there, yer evil \u2014 !\u201d Hagrid bellowed.\n\n\u201cCruc \u2014\u201d yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry could see him sneering.\n\n\u201cNo Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!\u201d he shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid\u2019s yells, and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got the nerve or the ability \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIncarc \u2014\u201d Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm.\n\n\u201cFight back!\u201d Harry screamed at him. \u201cFight back, you cowardly \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCoward, did you call me, Potter?\u201d shouted Snape. \u201cYour father would never attack me unless it was four on one, what would you call him, I wonder?\u201d\n\n\u201cStupe \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBlocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!\u201d sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more. \u201cNow come!\u201d he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry. \u201cIt is time to be gone, before the Ministry turns up \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cImpedi \u2014\u201d\n\nBut before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry; he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or madness \u2014\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d roared Snape\u2019s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, \u201cHave you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark Lord \u2014 we are to leave him! Go! Go!\u201d\n\nAnd Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant, he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself \u2014\n\n\u201cSectum \u2014 !\u201d\n\nSnape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape\u2019s face clearly at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed a face full of rage. Mustering all his powers of concentration, Harry thought, Levi \u2014\n\n\u201cNo, Potter!\u201d screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been. Snape\u2019s pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYou dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented them \u2014 I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you\u2019d turn my inventions on me, like your filthy father, would you? I don\u2019t think so . . . no!\u201d\n\nHarry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight.\n\n\u201cKill me then,\u201d panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and contempt. \u201cKill me like you killed him, you coward \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T \u2014\u201d screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them \u2014 \u201cCALL ME COWARD!\u201d\n\nAnd he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech \u2014\n\nHarry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the school\u2019s boundaries.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. \u201cHAGRID?\u201d\n\nHe stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful stabs.\n\n\u201cYeh all righ\u2019, Harry? Yeh all righ\u2019? Speak ter me, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put out a hand and felt Fang\u2019s reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d panted Harry. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course I am . . . take more\u2019n that ter finish me.\u201d\n\nHagrid put his hands under Harry\u2019s arms and raised him up with such force that Harry\u2019s feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling down Hagrid\u2019s cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling rapidly.\n\n\u201cWe should put out your house,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthe charm\u2019s \u2018Aguamenti\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cKnew it was summat like that,\u201d mumbled Hagrid, and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, \u201cAguamenti!\u201d\n\nA jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and murmured \u201cAguamenti\u201d too: Together, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished.\n\n\u201cS\u2019not too bad,\u201d said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, looking at the smoking wreck. \u201cNothin\u2019 Dumbledore won\u2019 be able to put righ\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him.\n\n\u201cHagrid . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI was bindin\u2019 up a couple o\u2019 bowtruckle legs when I heard \u2019em comin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin. \u201cThey\u2019ll\u2019ve bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what happened, Harry? I jus\u2019 saw them Death Eaters runnin\u2019 down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin\u2019 with \u2019em? Where\u2019s he gone \u2014 was he chasin\u2019 them?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe . . .\u201d Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the smoke. \u201cHagrid, he killed . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cKilled?\u201d said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. \u201cSnape killed? What\u2019re yeh on abou\u2019, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSnape killed . . . Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nHagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be seen completely blank, uncomprehending.\n\n\u201cDumbledore wha\u2019, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead. Snape killed him. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 say that,\u201d said Hagrid roughly. \u201cSnape kill Dumbledore \u2014 don\u2019 be stupid, Harry. Wha\u2019s made yeh say tha\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw it happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh couldn\u2019 have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw it, Hagrid.\u201d\n\nHagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx. . . .\n\n\u201cWhat musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters,\u201d Hagrid said confidently. \u201cI suppose he\u2019s gotta keep his cover. Look, let\u2019s get yeh back up ter the school. Come on, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. . . . As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . .\n\nThe oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry\u2019s eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought Dumbledore\u2019s body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to move toward it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re they all lookin\u2019 at?\u201d said Hagrid, as he and Harry approached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles. \u201cWha\u2019s tha\u2019, lyin\u2019 on the grass?\u201d Hagrid added sharply, heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a small crowd was congregating. \u201cSee it, Harry? Righ\u2019 at the foot o\u2019 the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don\u2019 think someone got thrown \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though somebody near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .\n\nHe and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap.\n\nHarry heard Hagrid\u2019s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet.\n\nDumbledore\u2019s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help. . . .\n\nThe crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down.\n\nThe locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledore\u2019s pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong. . . .\n\nHe turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherin\u2019s mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been.\n\nAutomatically, without really thinking about what he was doing, Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:\n\nTo the Dark Lord\n\nI know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.\n\nI face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.\n\nR.A.B.\n\n\n\nHarry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing. Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter29": "THE PHOENIX LAMENT\n\n\n\n\nC\u2019mere, Harry . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh can\u2019 stay here, Harry. . . . Come on, now. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nHe did not want to leave Dumbledore\u2019s side, he did not want to move anywhere. Hagrid\u2019s hand on his shoulder was trembling. Then another voice said, \u201cHarry, come on.\u201d\n\nA much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry\u2019s vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the hospital wing,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hurt,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s McGonagall\u2019s orders,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cEveryone\u2019s up there, Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone \u2014\u201d\n\nFear stirred in Harry\u2019s chest again: He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind.\n\n\u201cGinny, who else is dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, none of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the Dark Mark \u2014 Malfoy said he stepped over a body \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe stepped over Bill, but it\u2019s all right, he\u2019s alive.\u201d\n\nThere was something in her voice, however, that Harry knew boded ill.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure . . . he\u2019s a \u2014 a bit of a mess, that\u2019s all. Greyback attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he won\u2019t \u2014 won\u2019t look the same anymore. . . .\u201d\n\nGinny\u2019s voice trembled a little.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know what the aftereffects will be \u2014 I mean, Greyback being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the others . . . There were other bodies on the ground. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pomfrey says they\u2019ll be all right. And a Death Eater\u2019s dead, he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere \u2014 Harry, if we hadn\u2019t had your Felix potion, I think we\u2019d all have been killed, but everything seemed to just miss us \u2014\u201d\n\nThey had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open the doors, Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door. Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.\n\n\u201cAre you all right, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. . . . How\u2019s Bill?\u201d\n\nNobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione\u2019s shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill\u2019s pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoy\u2019s Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you fix them with a charm or something?\u201d he asked the matron.\n\n\u201cNo charm will work on these,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything I know, but there is no cure for werewolf bites.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t bitten at the full moon,\u201d said Ron, who was gazing down into his brother\u2019s face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring. \u201cGreyback hadn\u2019t transformed, so surely Bill won\u2019t be a \u2014 a real \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHe looked uncertainly at Lupin.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that Bill will be a true werewolf,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cbut that does not mean that there won\u2019t be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and \u2014 and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on.\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore might know something that\u2019d work, though,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWhere is he? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledore\u2019s orders, Dumbledore owes him, he can\u2019t leave him in this state \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon \u2014 Dumbledore\u2019s dead,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when Harry did not, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill\u2019s bed, his hands over his face. Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private, indecent. He turned away and caught Ron\u2019s eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said.\n\n\u201cHow did he die?\u201d whispered Tonks. \u201cHow did it happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape killed him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI was there, I saw it. We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that\u2019s where the Mark was. . . . Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilized me, I couldn\u2019t do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak \u2014 and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned. Luna\u2019s mouth trembled.\n\n\u201c\u2014 more Death Eaters arrived \u2014 and then Snape \u2014 and Snape did it. The Avada Kedavra.\u201d Harry couldn\u2019t go on.\n\nMadam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny, who whispered, \u201cShh! Listen!\u201d\n\nGulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.\n\nHow long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward. Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.\n\n\u201cMolly and Arthur are on their way,\u201d she said, and the spell of the music was broken: Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their own eyes, shake their heads. \u201cHarry, what happened? According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he \u2014 when it happened. He says Professor Snape was involved in some \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape killed Dumbledore,\u201d said Harry.\n\nShe stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under McGonagall.\n\n\u201cSnape,\u201d repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair. \u201cWe all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . Snape . . . I can\u2019t believe it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,\u201d said Lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. \u201cWe always knew that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Dumbledore swore he was on our side!\u201d whispered Tonks. \u201cI always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we didn\u2019t. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape,\u201d muttered Professor McGonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan-edged handkerchief. \u201cI mean . . . with Snape\u2019s history . . . of course people were bound to wonder . . . but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape\u2019s repentance was absolutely genuine. . . . Wouldn\u2019t hear a word against him!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to know what Snape told him to convince him,\u201d said Tonks.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. \u201cSnape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn\u2019t realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he\u2019d done it, sorry that they were dead.\u201d\n\nThey all stared at him.\n\n\u201cAnd Dumbledore believed that?\u201d said Lupin incredulously. \u201cDumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape hated James. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t think my mother was worth a damn either,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbecause she was Muggle-born. . . . \u2018Mudblood,\u2019 he called her. . . .\u201d\n\nNobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.\n\n\u201cThis is all my fault,\u201d said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. \u201cMy fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for him to come and help us! If I hadn\u2019t alerted Snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I don\u2019t think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don\u2019t think he knew they were coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault, Minerva,\u201d said Lupin firmly. \u201cWe all wanted more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death Eaters\u2019 side?\u201d asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape\u2019s duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how it happened,\u201d said Professor McGonagall distractedly. \u201cIt\u2019s all so confusing. . . . Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and Nymphadora were to join us . . . and so we patrolled. All seemed quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. I still don\u2019t know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. \u201cSo they got in through the Room of Requirement.\u201d\n\nAlmost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both of whom looked devastated.\n\n\u201cI messed up, Harry,\u201d said Ron bleakly. \u201cWe did like you told us: We checked the Marauder\u2019s Map and we couldn\u2019t see Malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me, Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on it . . . but Malfoy got past us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cHe was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Hand of Glory,\u201d said Ron. \u201cGives light only to the holder, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Ginny went on, \u201che must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,\u201d said Ron bitterly. \u201cFred and George\u2019s. I\u2019m going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cNothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them, but we didn\u2019t dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time we\u2019d reached a corridor that was light, they\u2019d gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuckily,\u201d said Lupin hoarsely, \u201cRon, Ginny, and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. We found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn\u2019t expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTo set off the Mark?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cHe must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville,\u201d said Harry, turning to Hermione, \u201cwere you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOutside Snape\u2019s office, yes,\u201d whispered Hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, \u201cwith Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. . . . We didn\u2019t know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the map. . . . It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don\u2019t think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape\u2019s office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and \u2014 and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry urged her.\n\n\u201cI was so stupid, Harry!\u201d said Hermione in a high-pitched whisper. \u201cHe said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he \u2014 while he went to help fight the Death Eaters \u2014\u201d She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled. \u201cWe went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor . . . and oh, it\u2019s so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn\u2019t realize, Harry, we didn\u2019t realize, we just let Snape go!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d said Lupin firmly. \u201cHermione, had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he probably would have killed you and Luna.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo then he came upstairs,\u201d said Harry, who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase in his mind\u2019s eye, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, \u201cand he found the place where you were all fighting. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were in trouble, we were losing,\u201d said Tonks in a low voice. \u201cGibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged by Greyback . . . It was all dark . . . curses flying everywhere . . . The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs . . . then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. . . . Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us could break through,\u201d said Ron, \u201cand that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then Snape was there,\u201d said Tonks, \u201cand then he wasn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eater\u2019s jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cI saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it wasn\u2019t there,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI tried to follow him, but was thrown back just like Neville. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must have known a spell we didn\u2019t,\u201d whispered McGonagall. \u201cAfter all \u2014 he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. . . . I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who\u2019d escaped up to the tower. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was,\u201d said Harry savagely, \u201cbut to help them, not to stop them . . . and I\u2019ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier \u2014 so what happened when he came back down?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the stairs,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cWe all ran forward \u2014 those of us who were still standing anyway \u2014 and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust \u2014 obviously, none of us attacked them \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just let them pass,\u201d said Tonks in a hollow voice. \u201cWe thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters \u2014 and next thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again \u2014 I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I don\u2019t know what \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe shouted, \u2018It\u2019s over,\u2019\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe\u2019d done what he\u2019d meant to do.\u201d\n\nThey all fell silent. Fawkes\u2019s lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, unbidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harry\u2019s mind. . . . Had they taken Dumbledore\u2019s body from the foot of the tower yet? What would happen to it next? Where would it rest? He clenched his fists tightly in his pockets. He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand.\n\nThe doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just behind them, her beautiful face terrified.\n\n\u201cMolly \u2014 Arthur \u2014\u201d said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them. \u201cI am so sorry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBill,\u201d whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Bill\u2019s mangled face. \u201cOh, Bill!\u201d\n\nLupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.\n\n\u201cYou said Greyback attacked him?\u201d Mr. Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly. \u201cBut he hadn\u2019t transformed? So what does that mean? What will happen to Bill?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, looking helplessly at Lupin.\n\n\u201cThere will probably be some contamination, Arthur,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cIt is an odd case, possibly unique. . . . We don\u2019t know what his behavior might be like when he awakens. . . .\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bill\u2019s wounds.\n\n\u201cAnd Dumbledore . . .\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cMinerva, is it true . . . Is he really . . . ?\u201d\n\nAs Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face.\n\n\u201cDumbledore gone,\u201d whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto Bill\u2019s mutilated face.\n\n\u201cOf course, it doesn\u2019t matter how he looks. . . . It\u2019s not r-really important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always very handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do you mean by zat?\u201d said Fleur suddenly and loudly. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018\u2019e was going to be married?\u2019\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled. \u201cWell \u2014 only that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?\u201d demanded Fleur. \u201cYou theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause \u2019e will!\u201d said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. \u201cIt would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, \u201cbut I thought perhaps \u2014 given how \u2014 how he \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per\u2019aps, you hoped?\u201d said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. \u201cWhat do I care how he looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!\u201d she added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her.\n\nMrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bill\u2019s wounds with a most curious expression upon her face. Nobody said anything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody else, he was waiting for the explosion.\n\n\u201cOur Great-Auntie Muriel,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, \u201chas a very beautiful tiara \u2014 goblin-made \u2014 which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Fleur stiffly. \u201cI am sure zat will be lovely.\u201d\n\nAnd then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.\n\n\u201cYou see!\u201d said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. \u201cShe still wants to marry him, even though he\u2019s been bitten! She doesn\u2019t care!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense. \u201cBill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are completely \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t care either, I don\u2019t care!\u201d said Tonks, seizing the front of Lupin\u2019s robes and shaking them. \u201cI\u2019ve told you a million times. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd the meaning of Tonks\u2019s Patronus and her mouse-colored hair, and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback, all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve told you a million times,\u201d said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, \u201cthat I am too old for you, too poor . . . too dangerous. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said all along you\u2019re taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur\u2019s shoulder as she patted her on the back.\n\n\u201cI am not being ridiculous,\u201d said Lupin steadily. \u201cTonks deserves somebody young and whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she wants you,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. \u201cAnd after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain so.\u201d\n\nHe gestured sadly at his son, lying between them.\n\n\u201cThis is . . . not the moment to discuss it,\u201d said Lupin, avoiding everybody\u2019s eyes as he looked around distractedly. \u201cDumbledore is dead. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,\u201d said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in.\n\nThe little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen; he was shaking with tears, a vast, spotted handkerchief in his hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve . . . I\u2019ve done it, Professor,\u201d he choked. \u201cM-moved him. Professor Sprout\u2019s got the kids back in bed. Professor Flitwick\u2019s lyin\u2019 down, but he says he\u2019ll be all righ\u2019 in a jiffy, an\u2019 Professor Slughorn says the Ministry\u2019s bin informed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Hagrid,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, standing up at once and turning to look at the group around Bill\u2019s bed. \u201cI shall have to see the Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the Heads of Houses \u2014 Slughorn can represent Slytherin \u2014 that I want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like you to join us too.\u201d\n\nAs Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again, she looked down at Harry. \u201cBefore I meet them I would like a quick word with you, Harry. If you\u2019ll come with me. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stood up, murmured \u201cSee you in a bit\u201d to Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGonagall\u2019s office, but for Dumbledore\u2019s, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress. . . . Apparently she was now headmistress . . . so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers.\n\nIn silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumbledore\u2019s body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle-legged tables, Gryffindor\u2019s sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk. But Fawkes\u2019s perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his half-moon spectacles perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.\n\nAfter glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that, Professor,\u201d said Harry. He had expected the question and had his answer ready. It had been here, in this very room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cHarry, it might be important,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d said Harry, \u201cvery, but he didn\u2019t want me to tell anyone.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall glared at him. \u201cPotter\u201d \u2014 Harry registered the renewed use of his surname \u2014 \u201cin the light of Professor Dumbledore\u2019s death, I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry, shrugging. \u201cProfessor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here, though. Madam Rosmerta\u2019s under the Imperius Curse, she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, that\u2019s how the necklace and the poisoned mead \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRosmerta?\u201d said Professor McGonagall incredulously, but before she could go on, there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn traipsed into the room, followed by Hagrid, who was still weeping copiously, his huge frame trembling with grief.\n\n\u201cSnape!\u201d ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale and sweating. \u201cSnape! I taught him! I thought I knew him!\u201d\n\nBut before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall: A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas.\n\n\u201cMinerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just Disapparated from the Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Everard,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and she turned quickly to her teachers.\n\n\u201cI want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cPersonally, I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year. The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts\u2019s history. It is horrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open,\u201d said Professor Sprout. \u201cI feel that if a single pupil wants to come, then the school ought to remain open for that pupil.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut will we have a single pupil after this?\u201d said Slughorn, now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. \u201cParents will want to keep their children at home and I can\u2019t say I blame them. Personally, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you can\u2019t expect mothers to think like that. They\u2019ll want to keep their families together, it\u2019s only natural.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd in any case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school \u2014 and I must say that Professor Dumbledore\u2019s murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin\u2019s monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must consult the governors,\u201d said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snape\u2019s office. \u201cWe must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be made hastily.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, you haven\u2019t said anything,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cWhat are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?\u201d\n\nHagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red eyes and croaked, \u201cI dunno, Professor . . . that\u2019s fer the Heads of House an\u2019 the headmistress ter decide . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore always valued your views,\u201d said Professor McGonagall kindly, \u201cand so do I.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m stayin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. \u201cIt\u2019s me home, it\u2019s bin me home since I was thirteen. An\u2019 if there\u2019s kids who wan\u2019 me ter teach \u2019em, I\u2019ll do it. But . . . I dunno . . . Hogwarts without Dumbledore . . .\u201d He gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the window at the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching, \u201cthen I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision.\n\n\u201cNow, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about Dumbledore\u2019s funeral?\u201d said Harry, speaking at last.\n\n\u201cWell . . .\u201d said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook. \u201cI \u2014 I know that it was Dumbledore\u2019s wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Harry fiercely.\n\n\u201cIf the Ministry thinks it appropriate,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cNo other headmaster or headmistress has ever been \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school,\u201d growled Hagrid.\n\n\u201cHogwarts should be Dumbledore\u2019s final resting place,\u201d said Professor Flitwick.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Professor Sprout.\n\n\u201cAnd in that case,\u201d said Harry, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t send the students home until the funeral\u2019s over. They\u2019ll want to say \u2014\u201d\n\nThe last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout completed the sentence for him.\n\n\u201cGood-bye.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell said,\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick. \u201cWell said indeed! Our students should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange transport home afterward.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeconded,\u201d barked Professor Sprout.\n\n\u201cI suppose . . . yes . . .\u201d said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice, while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d said Professor McGonagall suddenly, gazing down into the grounds. \u201cThe Minister . . . and by the looks of it, he\u2019s brought a delegation . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I leave, Professor?\u201d said Harry at once.\n\nHe had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Rufus Scrimgeour tonight.\n\n\u201cYou may,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd quickly.\u201d\n\nShe strode toward the door and held it open for him. He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower, but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves. He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room.\n\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. \u201cIt is really true? Dumbledore \u2014 dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\nShe let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung forward to admit him.\n\nAs Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was jam-packed. The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This meant that the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without speaking to anybody, without making eye contact at all, Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys\u2019 dormitories.\n\nAs he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sitting on his bed. Harry sat down on his own four-poster and for a moment, they simply stared at each other.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re talking about closing the school,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cLupin said they would,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the furniture might be listening in. \u201cDid you find one? Did you get it? A \u2014 a Horcrux?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head. All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and only hours ago?\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t get it?\u201d said Ron, looking crestfallen. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSomeone had already taken it and left a fake in its place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready taken \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nWordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket, opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full story could wait. . . . It did not matter tonight . . . nothing mattered except the end, the end of their pointless adventure, the end of Dumbledore\u2019s life. . . .\n\n\u201cR.A.B.,\u201d whispered Ron, \u201cbut who was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards. He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B.: He doubted that he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there, he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes had stopped singing.\n\nAnd he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry."}
{"6-Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-chapter30": "THE WHITE TOMB\n\n\n\n\nAll lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days \u2014 the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledore\u2019s death, and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the entrance hall that was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to Dumbledore.\n\nSome excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the forest. Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrid\u2019s arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister of Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he was sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Dumbledore\u2019s last excursion from Hogwarts.\n\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were spending all of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Harry could imagine how it would have been if Dumbledore had not died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, Ginny\u2019s examinations finished, the pressure of homework lifted . . . and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.\n\nThey visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been discharged, but Bill remained under Madam Pomfrey\u2019s care. His scars were as bad as ever \u2014 in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs \u2014 but in personality he seemed just the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks.\n\n\u201c. . . so eet ees lucky \u2019e is marrying me,\u201d said Fleur happily, plumping up Bill\u2019s pillows, \u201cbecause ze British overcook their meat, I \u2019ave always said this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose I\u2019m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her,\u201d sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room, looking out over the twilit grounds.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not that bad,\u201d said Harry. \u201cUgly, though,\u201d he added hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant giggle.\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone else we know died?\u201d Ron asked Hermione, who was perusing the Evening Prophet.\n\nHermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. \u201cNo,\u201d she said reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. \u201cThey\u2019re still looking for Snape but no sign . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course there isn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry, who became angry every time this subject cropped up. \u201cThey won\u2019t find Snape till they find Voldemort, and seeing as they\u2019ve never managed to do that in all this time . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go to bed,\u201d yawned Ginny. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping that well since . . . well . . . I could do with some sleep.\u201d\n\nShe kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the other two, and departed for the girls\u2019 dormitories. The moment the door had closed behind her, Hermione leaned forward toward Harry with a most Hermione-ish look on her face.\n\n\u201cHarry, I found something out this morning, in the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cR.A.B.?\u201d said Harry, sitting up straight.\n\nHe did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curious, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and Dumbledore had set out upon together, and which he now knew he would have to journey alone. There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere, and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: the locket . . . the cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor\u2019s or Ravenclaw\u2019s . . . the locket . . . the cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor\u2019s or Ravenclaw\u2019s . . .\n\nThis mantra seemed to pulse through Harry\u2019s mind as he fell asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets, and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb. . . .\n\nHe had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledore\u2019s death, and although she had not immediately recognized the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said sadly, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying, Harry, but I haven\u2019t found anything. . . . There are a couple of reasonably well-known wizards with those initials \u2014 Rosalind Antigone Bungs . . . Rupert \u2018Axebanger\u2019 Brookstanton . . . but they don\u2019t seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can\u2019t find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him. . . . No, actually, it\u2019s about . . . well, Snape.\u201d\n\nShe looked nervous even saying the name again.\n\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince business,\u201d she said tentatively.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d\u2019you think I feel about that now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no \u2014 Harry, I didn\u2019t mean that!\u201d she said hastily, looking around to check that they were not being overheard. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she was Snape\u2019s mother!\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought she wasn\u2019t much of a looker,\u201d said Ron. Hermione ignored him.\n\n\u201cI was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and then later an announcement saying that she\u2019d given birth to a \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 murderer,\u201d spat Harry.\n\n\u201cWell . . . yes,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cSo . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have been proud of being \u2018half a Prince,\u2019 you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle from what it said in the Prophet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that fits,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe\u2019d play up the pure-blood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He\u2019s just like Voldemort. Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name \u2014 Lord Voldemort \u2014 the Half-Blood Prince \u2014 how could Dumbledore have missed \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHe broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledore\u2019s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . In spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much. . . .\n\nHelped him . . . it was an almost unendurable thought now.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t get why he didn\u2019t turn you in for using that book,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe must\u2019ve known where you were getting it all from.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knew,\u201d said Harry bitterly. \u201cHe knew when I used Sectumsempra. He didn\u2019t really need Legilimency. . . . He might even have known before then, with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions. . . . Shouldn\u2019t have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard, should he?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t he turn you in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he wanted to associate himself with that book,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI don\u2019t think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if he\u2019d known. And even if Snape pretended it hadn\u2019t been his, Slughorn would have recognized his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snape\u2019s old classroom, and I\u2019ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called \u2018Prince.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve shown the book to Dumbledore,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAll that time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and I had proof Snape was too \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Evil\u2019 is a strong word,\u201d said Hermione quietly.\n\n\u201cYou were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to say, Harry, that you\u2019re putting too much blame on yourself. I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us could\u2019ve guessed Snape would . . . you know,\u201d said Ron.\n\nSilence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, were thinking about the following morning, when Dumbledore\u2019s body would be laid to rest. He had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel. He wondered whether Dumbledore\u2019s death would be more real to him once it was over. Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult to believe that Dumbledore had really gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back. . . . He felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do.\n\nHarry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral. Downstairs, he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. Hagrid\u2019s chair was deserted too; Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast, but Snape\u2019s place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among Scrimgeour\u2019s entourage Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.\n\nOver at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were muttering together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked oddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of Malfoy between them, bossing them around. Harry had not spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy\u2019s voice on that tower top, nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy now, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents?\n\nHarry\u2019s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny. Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet, and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once.\n\n\u201cIt is nearly time,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease follow your Heads of Houses out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.\u201d\n\nThey filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column, wearing magnificent, long, emerald green robes embroidered with silver. He had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, looking so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they reached the entrance hall, they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs.\n\nThey were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out onto the stone steps from the front doors, toward the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the center of them: There was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summer\u2019s day.\n\nAn extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs; shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognize, but a few he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London; Arabella Figg, Harry\u2019s Squib neighbor; the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog\u2019s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially on the gleaming air.\n\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. Neville and Luna alone of the D.A. had responded to Hermione\u2019s summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: They were the ones who had missed the D.A. most . . . probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting.\n\nCornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognized Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-taloned hand, and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-colored curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the water\u2019s edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away.\n\nThe staff was seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall. He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that Dumbledore was dead. But then he heard music, strange, otherworldly music, and he forgot his dislike of the Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the only one: Many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed.\n\n\u201cIn there,\u201d whispered Ginny in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\nAnd he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi: a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on Harry\u2019s neck stand up, and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers, he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore\u2019s passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked around.\n\nHagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to be Dumbledore\u2019s body. A sharp pain rose in Harry\u2019s throat at this sight: For a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledore\u2019s body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s laps.\n\nThey could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalized looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores Umbridge . . . but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid\u2019s eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realized what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother, and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped, and he turned to face the front again.\n\nA little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledore\u2019s body. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of heads. \u201cNobility of spirit\u201d . . . \u201cintellectual contribution\u201d . . . \u201cgreatness of heart\u201d . . . It did not mean very much. It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore\u2019s idea of a few words, \u201cnitwit,\u201d \u201coddment,\u201d \u201cblubber,\u201d and \u201ctweak,\u201d and again had to suppress a grin. . . . What was the matter with him?\n\nThere was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the water\u2019s edge two years ago, very close to where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said. . . .\n\nAnd then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone. . . . He clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: He looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, toward the forest, as the little man in black droned on. . . . There was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects too. They did not move into the open but Harry saw them standing quite still, half hidden in shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated. . . .\n\nAnd Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one, his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one, that the shelter of a parent\u2019s arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was more alone than he had ever been before.\n\nThe little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet; he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody moved.\n\nThen several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted around Dumbledore\u2019s body and the table upon which it lay: Higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore\u2019s body and the table on which he had rested.\n\nThere were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was, Harry knew, the centaurs\u2019 tribute: He saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees. Likewise, the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view.\n\nHarry looked at Ginny, Ron, and Hermione: Ron\u2019s face was screwed up as though the sunlight were blinding him. Hermione\u2019s face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She met Harry\u2019s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say, \u201cBe careful,\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died.\n\n\u201cGinny, listen . . .\u201d he said very quietly, as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet, \u201cI can\u2019t be involved with you anymore. We\u2019ve got to stop seeing each other. We can\u2019t be together.\u201d\n\nShe said, with an oddly twisted smile, \u201cIt\u2019s for some stupid, noble reason, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like . . . like something out of someone else\u2019s life, these last few weeks with you,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut I can\u2019t . . . we can\u2019t . . . I\u2019ve got things to do alone now.\u201d\n\nShe did not cry, she simply looked at him.\n\n\u201cVoldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He\u2019s already used you as bait once, and that was just because you\u2019re my best friend\u2019s sister. Think how much danger you\u2019ll be in if we keep this up. He\u2019ll know, he\u2019ll find out. He\u2019ll try and get to me through you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t care?\u201d said Ginny fiercely.\n\n\u201cI care,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHow do you think I\u2019d feel if this was your funeral . . . and it was my fault. . . .\u201d\n\nShe looked away from him, over the lake.\n\n\u201cI never really gave up on you,\u201d she said. \u201cNot really. I always hoped. . . . Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more \u2014 myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart girl, that Hermione,\u201d said Harry, trying to smile. \u201cI just wish I\u2019d asked you sooner. We could\u2019ve had ages . . . months . . . years maybe. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve been too busy saving the Wizarding world,\u201d said Ginny, half laughing. \u201cWell . . . I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn\u2019t be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that\u2019s why I like you so much.\u201d\n\nHarry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her. Ron, he saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own long nose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledore\u2019s tomb, and walked away around the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still, just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nHe turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly toward him around the bank, leaning on his walking stick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hoping to have a word . . . do you mind if I walk a little way with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry indifferently, and set off again.\n\n\u201cHarry, this was a dreadful tragedy,\u201d said Scrimgeour quietly. \u201cI cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was a very great wizard. We had our disagreements, as you know, but no one knows better than I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d asked Harry flatly.\n\nScrimgeour looked annoyed, but as before, hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding.\n\n\u201cYou are, of course, devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that you were very close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favorite pupil ever. The bond between the two of you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Harry repeated, coming to a halt.\n\nScrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick, and stared at Harry, his expression shrewd now.\n\n\u201cThe word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose word?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cSomebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the tower after Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The Ministry can add two and two, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business. He didn\u2019t want people to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch loyalty is admirable, of course,\u201d said Scrimgeour, who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty, \u201cbut Dumbledore is gone, Harry. He\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him,\u201d said Harry, smiling in spite of himself.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy . . . even Dumbledore cannot return from the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not saying he can. You wouldn\u2019t understand. But I\u2019ve got nothing to tell you.\u201d\n\nScrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy, \u201cThe Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection, you know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry laughed. \u201cVoldemort wants to kill me himself, and Aurors won\u2019t stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, \u201cthe request I made of you at Christmas \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat request? Oh yeah . . . the one where I tell the world what a great job you\u2019re doing in exchange for \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 for raising everyone\u2019s morale!\u201d snapped Scrimgeour.\n\nHarry considered him for a moment.\n\n\u201cReleased Stan Shunpike yet?\u201d\n\nScrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly reminiscent of Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cI see you are \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s man through and through,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nScrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped away without another word. Harry could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their seats. Ron and Hermione were hurrying toward Harry, passing Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction. Harry turned and walked slowly on, waiting for them to catch up, which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times.\n\n\u201cWhat did Scrimgeour want?\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\n\u201cSame as he wanted at Christmas,\u201d shrugged Harry. \u201cWanted me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministry\u2019s new poster boy.\u201d\n\nRon seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said loudly to Hermione, \u201cLook, let me go back and hit Percy!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly, grabbing his arm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll make me feel better!\u201d\n\nHarry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t bear the idea that we might never come back,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHow can Hogwarts close?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019re not in any more danger here than we are at home, are we? Everywhere\u2019s the same now. I\u2019d even say Hogwarts is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the place. What d\u2019you reckon, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not coming back even if it does reopen,\u201d said Harry.\n\nRon gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, \u201cI knew you were going to say that. But then what will you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going back to the Dursleys\u2019 once more, because Dumbledore wanted me to,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be a short visit, and then I\u2019ll be gone for good.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where will you go if you don\u2019t come back to school?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I might go back to Godric\u2019s Hollow,\u201d Harry muttered. He had had the idea in his head ever since the night of Dumbledore\u2019s death. \u201cFor me, it started there, all of it. I\u2019ve just got a feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parents\u2019 graves, I\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven\u2019t I?\u201d said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledore\u2019s white tomb, reflected in the water on the other side of the lake. \u201cThat\u2019s what he wanted me to do, that\u2019s why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right \u2014 and I\u2019m sure he was \u2014 there are still four of them out there. I\u2019ve got to find them and destroy them, and then I\u2019ve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort\u2019s soul, the bit that\u2019s still in his body, and I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape along the way,\u201d he added, \u201cso much the better for me, so much the worse for him.\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now, the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there, Harry,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt your aunt and uncle\u2019s house,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll go with you wherever you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014\u201d said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone.\n\n\u201cYou said to us once before,\u201d said Hermione quietly, \u201cthat there was time to turn back if we wanted to. We\u2019ve had time, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re with you whatever happens,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut mate, you\u2019re going to have to come round my mum and dad\u2019s house before we do anything else, even Godric\u2019s Hollow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBill and Fleur\u2019s wedding, remember?\u201d\n\nHarry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.\n\n\u201cYeah, we shouldn\u2019t miss that,\u201d he said finally.\n\nHis hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione."}
