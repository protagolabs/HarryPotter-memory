{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter1": "THE DARK LORD ASCENDING\n\n\n\n\nThe two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other\u2019s chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.\n\n\u201cNews?\u201d asked the taller of the two.\n\n\u201cThe best,\u201d replied Severus Snape.\n\nThe lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men\u2019s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.\n\n\u201cThought I might be late,\u201d said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. \u201cIt was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?\u201d\n\nSnape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men\u2019s way. Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke.\n\nThe yew hedges muffled the sound of the men\u2019s footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his companion\u2019s head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the hedge.\n\n\u201cHe always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks . . .\u201d Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort.\n\nA handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.\n\nThe hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.\n\nThe drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room\u2019s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.\n\n\u201cYaxley. Snape,\u201d said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. \u201cYou are very nearly late.\u201d\n\nThe speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.\n\n\u201cSeverus, here,\u201d said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. \u201cYaxley \u2014 beside Dolohov.\u201d\n\nThe two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.\u201d\n\nThe interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.\n\n\u201cSaturday . . . at nightfall,\u201d repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape\u2019s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort\u2019s face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort\u2019s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.\n\n\u201cGood. Very good. And this information comes \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 from the source we discussed,\u201d said Snape.\n\n\u201cMy Lord.\u201d\n\nYaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to him.\n\n\u201cMy Lord, I have heard differently.\u201d\n\nYaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, \u201cDawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.\u201d\n\nSnape was smiling.\n\n\u201cMy source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,\u201d said Yaxley.\n\n\u201cIf he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,\u201d said Snape. \u201cI assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Order\u2019s got one thing right, then, eh?\u201d said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table.\n\nVoldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought.\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d Yaxley went on, \u201cDawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy \u2014\u201d\n\nVoldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape.\n\n\u201cWhere are they going to hide the boy next?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the home of one of the Order,\u201d said Snape. \u201cThe place, according to the source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Yaxley?\u201d Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. \u201cWill the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?\u201d\n\nOnce again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders.\n\n\u201cMy Lord, I have good news on that score. I have \u2014 with difficulty, and after great effort \u2014 succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.\u201d\n\nMany of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.\n\n\u201cIt is a start,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cBut Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister\u2019s life will set me back a long way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 my Lord, that is true \u2014 but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cAt any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are at an advantage there, my Lord,\u201d said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. \u201cWe now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will not do either,\u201d said Snape. \u201cThe Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the better,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cHe will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far.\u201d\n\nAgain, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, \u201cI shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.\u201d\n\nThe company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter\u2019s continued existence. Voldemort, however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the unconscious body above him.\n\n\u201cI have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.\u201d\n\nAt these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet.\n\n\u201cWormtail,\u201d said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above, \u201chave I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, m-my Lord,\u201d gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver.\n\n\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his followers, \u201cI understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter.\u201d\n\nThe faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.\n\n\u201cNo volunteers?\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cLet\u2019s see . . . Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore.\u201d\n\nLucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse.\n\n\u201cMy Lord?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wand, Lucius. I require your wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . .\u201d\n\nMalfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cElm, my Lord,\u201d whispered Malfoy.\n\n\u201cAnd the core?\u201d\n\n\u201cDragon \u2014 dragon heartstring.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort\u2019s wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously.\n\n\u201cGive you my wand, Lucius? My wand?\u201d\n\nSome of the throng sniggered.\n\n\u201cI have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late. . . . What is it about my presence in your home that displeases you, Lucius?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing \u2014 nothing, my Lord!\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch lies, Lucius . . .\u201d\n\nThe soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table.\n\nThe huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort\u2019s chair. It rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort\u2019s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man\u2019s thigh; its eyes, with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy.\n\n\u201cWhy do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my return, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, my Lord,\u201d said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip. \u201cWe did desire it \u2014 we do.\u201d\n\nTo Malfoy\u2019s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact.\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, \u201cit is an honor to have you here, in our family\u2019s house. There can be no higher pleasure.\u201d\n\nShe sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness.\n\n\u201cNo higher pleasure,\u201d repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he considered Bellatrix. \u201cThat means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.\u201d\n\nHer face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight.\n\n\u201cMy Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo higher pleasure . . . even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?\u201d\n\nShe stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, my Lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.\u201d\n\nThere was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys\u2019 humiliation. Bellatrix\u2019s face, so recently flushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red.\n\n\u201cShe is no niece of ours, my Lord,\u201d she cried over the outpouring of mirth. \u201cWe \u2014 Narcissa and I \u2014 have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with either of us, nor any beast she marries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat say you, Draco?\u201d asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. \u201cWill you babysit the cubs?\u201d\n\nThe hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother\u2019s eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nAnd the laughter died at once.\n\n\u201cMany of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,\u201d he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring. \u201cYou must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my Lord,\u201d whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again. \u201cAt the first chance!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shall have it,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cAnd in your family, so in the world . . . we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain. . . .\u201d\n\nVoldemort raised Lucius Malfoy\u2019s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds.\n\n\u201cDo you recognize our guest, Severus?\u201d asked Voldemort.\n\nSnape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, \u201cSeverus! Help me!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again.\n\n\u201cAnd you, Draco?\u201d asked Voldemort, stroking the snake\u2019s snout with his wand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her anymore.\n\n\u201cBut you would not have taken her classes,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cFor those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\u201d\n\nThere were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled.\n\n\u201cYes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles . . . how they are not so different from us . . . .\u201d\n\nOne of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape again.\n\n\u201cSeverus . . . please . . . please . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence,\u201d said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy\u2019s wand, and Charity fell silent as if gagged. \u201cNot content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance. . . . She would have us all mate with Muggles . . . or, no doubt, werewolves. . . .\u201d\n\nNobody laughed this time: There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort\u2019s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him again.\n\n\u201cAvada Kedavra.\u201d\n\nThe flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor.\n\n\u201cDinner, Nagini,\u201d said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter2": "IN MEMORIAM\n\n\n\n\nHarry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china: He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door.\n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHe looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley\u2019s idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap.\n\nIt was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it \u2014 particularly in light of his immediate plans \u2014 this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.\n\nHarry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom \u2014 old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood.\n\nHe now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather\u2019s last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.\n\nHarry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning\u2019s Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.\n\nIt took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder\u2019s Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable \u2014 in all usual senses it was worthless \u2014 but because of what it had cost to attain it.\n\nThis left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer.\n\nHe got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the newspapers, throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one. The owl was asleep, or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment.\n\nAs he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for.\n\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED\n\nby Elphias Doge\n\n\n\nI met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles.\n\nAlbus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to praise his father\u2019s action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken: As anybody who knew Albus would attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, his determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years.\n\nIn a matter of months, however, Albus\u2019s own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.\n\nHe not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore\u2019s future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial ambitions.\n\nThree years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus\u2019s brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus\u2019s shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother.\n\nWhen Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus\u2019s mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra\u2019s funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me.\n\nThat was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year\u2019s travels, that yet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana.\n\nThough Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her brothers. All those closest to Albus \u2014 and I count myself one of that lucky number \u2014 agree that Ariana\u2019s death, and Albus\u2019s feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left their mark upon him forevermore.\n\nI returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person\u2019s suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less lighthearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would lift \u2014 in later years they reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to mention them.\n\nOther quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore\u2019s innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle. Dumbledore\u2019s triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world\u2019s. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.\n\nHe had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined Dumbledore\u2019s childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.\n\nHe had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, Harry\u2019s past, Harry\u2019s future, Harry\u2019s plans . . . and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered honestly:\n\n\u201cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\u201d\n\nAfter several minutes\u2019 thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today\u2019s Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror.\n\nHarry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today\u2019s Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed.\n\nAcross the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:\n\nDUMBLEDORE \u2014 THE TRUTH AT LAST?\n\nComing next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end?\n\nThe answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page 13, inside.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on.\n\nIn person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious quill-portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip.\n\n\u201cWell, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer\u2019s dream,\u201d says Skeeter. \u201cSuch a long, full life. I\u2019m sure my book will be the first of very, very many.\u201d\n\nSkeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-page book was completed a mere four weeks after Dumbledore\u2019s mysterious death in June. I ask her how she managed this superfast feat.\n\n\u201cOh, when you\u2019ve been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is second nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be the first to meet that need.\u201d\n\nI mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore\u2019s, that \u201cSkeeter\u2019s book contains less fact than a Chocolate Frog card.\u201d\n\nSkeeter throws back her head and laughs.\n\n\u201cDarling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him. Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Elphias Doge\u2019s accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of Dumbledore\u2019s long and extraordinary life?\n\n\u201cOh, my dear,\u201d beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles, \u201cyou know as well as I do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word \u2018no,\u2019 and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought he was so wonderful, you know \u2014 he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I\u2019ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth.\u201d\n\nThe advance publicity for Skeeter\u2019s biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a blameless life. What were the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask?\n\n\u201cNow, come off it, Betty, I\u2019m not giving away all the highlights before anybody\u2019s bought the book!\u201d laughs Skeeter. \u201cBut I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! Let\u2019s just say that nobody hearing him rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn\u2019t exactly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.\u201d\n\nI ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore\u2019s brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago.\n\n\u201cOh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,\u201d laughs Skeeter. \u201cNo, no, I\u2019m talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats, worse even than the Muggle-maiming father \u2014 Dumbledore couldn\u2019t keep either of them quiet anyway, they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it\u2019s the mother and the sister that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness \u2014 but, as I say, you\u2019ll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it\u2019s no wonder Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken.\u201d\n\nFamily skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to Dumbledore\u2019s many magical discoveries?\n\n\u201cHe had brains,\u201d she concedes, \u201calthough many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon\u2019s blood when Dumbledore \u2018borrowed\u2019 his papers.\u201d\n\nBut the importance of some of Dumbledore\u2019s achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald?\n\n\u201cOh, now, I\u2019m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,\u201d says Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. \u201cI\u2019m afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore\u2019s spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell \u2014 or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. All I\u2019ll say is, don\u2019t be so sure that there really was the spectacular duel of legend. After they\u2019ve read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!\u201d\n\nSkeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d says Skeeter, nodding briskly, \u201cI devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter\u2013Dumbledore relationship. It\u2019s been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go. Whether that was really in the boy\u2019s best interests \u2014 well, we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled adolescence.\u201d\n\nI ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year: a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had returned.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, we\u2019ve developed a close bond,\u201d says Skeeter. \u201cPoor Potter has few real friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life \u2014 the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real Harry Potter.\u201d\n\nWhich leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledore\u2019s final hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died?\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to say too much \u2014 it\u2019s all in the book \u2014 but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the Wizarding community to decide \u2014 once they\u2019ve read my book.\u201d\n\nOn that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller. Dumbledore\u2019s legions of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin.\n\nHe began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from Rita\u2019s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter\u2013Dumbledore relationship . . . It\u2019s been called unhealthy, even sinister. . . . He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth . . . I\u2019ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for . . .\n\n\u201cLies!\u201d Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously.\n\nHarry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was defaming him. . . .\n\nA flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia\u2019s choosing: There was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him.\n\nHe had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never pierce him again."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter3": "THE DURSLEYS DEPARTING\n\n\n\n\nThe sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice yelled, \u201cOi! You!\u201d\n\nSixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom his uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, he had thought he saw Dumbledore\u2019s eye. It was not until his uncle bellowed, \u201cBOY!\u201d that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him.\n\n\u201cYou took your time!\u201d roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of the stairs. \u201cGet down here, I want a word!\u201d\n\nHarry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets. When he reached the living room he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in a neat salmon-colored coat, and Dudley, Harry\u2019s large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cSit down!\u201d said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. \u201cPlease!\u201d added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat.\n\nHarry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following his movements with anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple face crumpled with concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat a surprise,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you take that tone \u2014\u201d began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vernon Dursley waved her down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a lot of claptrap,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t believe a word of it. We\u2019re staying put, we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry\u2019s favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.\n\n\u201cAccording to you,\u201d Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and down the living room, \u201cwe \u2014 Petunia, Dudley, and I \u2014 are in danger. From \u2014 from \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of \u2018my lot,\u2019 right,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of Harry again. \u201cI was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it\u2019s a plot to get the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe house?\u201d repeated Harry. \u201cWhat house?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis house!\u201d shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to pulse. \u201cOur house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and then you\u2019re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d demanded Harry. \u201cA plot to get this house? Are you actually as stupid as you look?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare \u2014 !\u201d squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the danger he had spotted.\n\n\u201cJust in case you\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019ve already got a house, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?\u201d\n\nThere was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument.\n\n\u201cYou claim,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, \u201cthat this Lord Thing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 Voldemort,\u201d said Harry impatiently, \u201cand we\u2019ve been through this about a hundred times already. This isn\u2019t a claim, it\u2019s fact, Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley \u2014\u201d\n\nVernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry\u2019s summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201c\u2014 Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,\u201d Harry pressed on remorselessly. \u201cOnce I\u2019m seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I\u2019d come and try to rescue you.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s and Harry\u2019s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help. You\u2019re being offered serious protection, the best there is.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. Outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door neighbor\u2019s lawn mower stalled again.\n\n\u201cI thought there was a Ministry of Magic?\u201d asked Vernon Dursley abruptly.\n\n\u201cThere is,\u201d said Harry, surprised.\n\n\u201cWell, then, why can\u2019t they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection!\u201d\n\nHarry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted.\n\n\u201cYou heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,\u201d Harry replied. \u201cWe think the Ministry has been infiltrated.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heavily that his great black mustache rippled, his face still purple with concentration.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. I still don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t have that Kingsley bloke.\u201d\n\nHarry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had also been addressed half a dozen times.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve told you,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, \u201cKingsley is protecting the Mug \u2014 I mean, your Prime Minister.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly \u2014 he\u2019s the best!\u201d said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with his earring in.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s taken,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the job \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019d even seen CVs . . .\u201d began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set himself.\n\n\u201cThese accidents aren\u2019t accidents \u2014 the crashes and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news. People are disappearing and dying and he\u2019s behind it \u2014 Voldemort. I\u2019ve told you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the fogs \u2014 they\u2019re caused by dementors, and if you can\u2019t remember what they are, ask your son!\u201d\n\nDudley\u2019s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents\u2019 and Harry\u2019s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, \u201cThere are . . . more of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore?\u201d laughed Harry. \u201cMore than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d blustered Vernon Dursley. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbecause once I\u2019m seventeen, all of them \u2014 Death Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi \u2014 which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard \u2014 will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you\u2019ll agree you need help.\u201d\n\nThere was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, \u201cBut what about my work? What about Dudley\u2019s school? I don\u2019t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d shouted Harry. \u201cThey will torture and kill you like they did my parents!\u201d\n\n\u201cDad,\u201d said Dudley in a loud voice, \u201cDad \u2014 I\u2019m going with these Order people.\u201d\n\n\u201cDudley,\u201d said Harry, \u201cfor the first time in your life, you\u2019re talking sense.\u201d\n\nHe knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Order\u2019s help, his parents would accompany him: There could be no question of being separated from their Diddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be here in about five minutes,\u201d he said, and when none of the Dursleys replied, he left the room. The prospect of parting \u2014 probably forever \u2014 from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years\u2019 solid dislike?\n\nBack in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig\u2019s cage. They fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving soon, really soon,\u201d Harry told her. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll be able to fly again.\u201d\n\nThe doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow. \u201cAn honor, as ever!\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Dedalus,\u201d said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark-haired Hestia. \u201cIt\u2019s really good of you to do this . . . They\u2019re through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGood day to you, Harry Potter\u2019s relatives!\u201d said Dedalus happily, striding into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of mind. Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard.\n\n\u201cI see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told you, is a simple one,\u201d said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. \u201cWe shall be leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your house \u2014 Harry being still underage, it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him \u2014 we shall be driving, say, ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you. You know how to drive, I take it?\u201d he asked Uncle Vernon politely.\n\n\u201cKnow how to \u2014 ? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!\u201d spluttered Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cVery clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,\u201d said Dedalus. He was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word Dedalus spoke.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t even drive,\u201d he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him.\n\n\u201cYou, Harry,\u201d Dedalus continued, \u201cwill wait here for your guard. There has been a little change in the arrangements \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cI thought Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t do it,\u201d said Hestia tersely. \u201cMad-Eye will explain.\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, \u201cHurry up!\u201d Harry looked all around the room before realizing that the voice had issued from Dedalus\u2019s pocket watch.\n\n\u201cQuite right, we\u2019re operating to a very tight schedule,\u201d said Dedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat. \u201cWe are attempting to time your departure from the house with your family\u2019s Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at the moment you all head for safety.\u201d He turned to the Dursleys. \u201cWell, are we all packed and ready to go?\u201d\n\nNone of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring, appalled, at the bulge in Dedalus\u2019s waistcoat pocket.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,\u201d murmured Hestia. She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly,\n\n\u201cWell, this is good-bye, then, boy.\u201d\n\nHe swung his right arm upward to shake Harry\u2019s hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.\n\n\u201cReady, Diddy?\u201d asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.\n\nDudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.\n\n\u201cCome along, then,\u201d said Uncle Vernon.\n\nHe had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat don\u2019t you understand, popkin?\u201d asked Aunt Petunia, looking up at her son.\n\nDudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he coming with us?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring at Dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Uncle Vernon loudly.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he coming too?\u201d asked Dudley.\n\n\u201cWell, he \u2014 he doesn\u2019t want to,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the slightest,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d Uncle Vernon told Dudley. \u201cNow come on, we\u2019re off.\u201d\n\nHe marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway.\n\nIt seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. After several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said, \u201cBut where\u2019s he going to go?\u201d\n\nAunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that Dudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the silence.\n\n\u201cBut . . . surely you know where your nephew is going?\u201d she asked, looking bewildered.\n\n\u201cCertainly we know,\u201d said Vernon Dursley. \u201cHe\u2019s off with some of your lot, isn\u2019t he? Right, Dudley, let\u2019s get in the car, you heard the man, we\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d\n\nAgain, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not follow.\n\n\u201cOff with some of our lot?\u201d\n\nHestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before: Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Harry assured her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, honestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter?\u201d repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously. \u201cDon\u2019t these people realize what you\u2019ve been through? What danger you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort movement?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 no, they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey think I\u2019m a waste of space, actually, but I\u2019m used to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a waste of space.\u201d\n\nIf Harry had not seen Dudley\u2019s lips move, he might not have believed it. As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for one thing, Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself.\n\n\u201cWell . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley.\u201d\n\nAgain, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling, \u201cYou saved my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was your soul the dementor would have taken. . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into scarlet-faced silence.\n\nAunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry.\n\n\u201cS-so sweet, Dudders . . .\u201d she sobbed into his massive chest. \u201cS-such a lovely b-boy . . . s-saying thank you . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he hasn\u2019t said thank you at all!\u201d said Hestia indignantly. \u201cHe only said he didn\u2019t think Harry was a waste of space!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but coming from Dudley that\u2019s like \u2018I love you,\u2019\u201d said Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building.\n\n\u201cAre we going or not?\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living room door. \u201cI thought we were on a tight schedule!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 yes, we are,\u201d said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. \u201cWe really must be off. Harry \u2014\u201d\n\nHe tripped forward and wrung Harry\u2019s hand with both of his own.\n\n\u201c\u2014 good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon your shoulders.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry, \u201cright. Thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cFarewell, Harry,\u201d said Hestia, also clasping his hand. \u201cOur thoughts go with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope everything\u2019s okay,\u201d said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure we shall end up the best of chums,\u201d said Diggle brightly, waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him.\n\nDudley gently released himself from his mother\u2019s clutches and walked toward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand.\n\n\u201cBlimey, Dudley,\u201d said Harry over Aunt Petunia\u2019s renewed sobs, \u201cdid the dementors blow a different personality into you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d muttered Dudley. \u201cSee you, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . .\u201d said Harry, taking Dudley\u2019s hand and shaking it. \u201cMaybe. Take care, Big D.\u201d\n\nDudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed.\n\nAunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked around at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket, she said, \u201cWell \u2014 good-bye,\u201d and marched toward the door without looking at him.\n\n\u201cGood-bye,\u201d said Harry.\n\nShe stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him: She gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out of the room after her husband and son."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter4": "THE SEVEN POTTERS\n\n\n\n\nHarry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the window just in time to see the Dursleys\u2019 car swinging out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus\u2019s top hat was visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone.\n\nHarry picked up Hedwig\u2019s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley\u2019s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart\u2019s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to take a last look at the place?\u201d he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be here again. Don\u2019t you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories . . . Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the dementors. . . . Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? . . . And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.\n\n\u201cAnd under here, Hedwig\u201d \u2014 Harry pulled open a door under the stairs \u2014 \u201cis where I used to sleep! You never knew me then \u2014 Blimey, it\u2019s small, I\u2019d forgotten. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once \u2014 Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry had recounted it \u2014 a flying motorbike . . .\n\nThere was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle Vernon\u2019s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden.\n\nThe darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses.\n\nWrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, \u201cAll righ\u2019, Harry? Ready fer the off?\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Harry, beaming around at them all. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t expecting this many of you!\u201d\n\n\u201cChange of plan,\u201d growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous, bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. \u201cLet\u2019s get undercover before we talk you through it.\u201d\n\nHarry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia\u2019s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances: Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald, black, broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy basset hound\u2019s eyes and matted hair. Harry\u2019s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met.\n\n\u201cKingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?\u201d he called across the room.\n\n\u201cHe can get along without me for one night,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cYou\u2019re more important.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, guess what?\u201d said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glittered there.\n\n\u201cYou got married?\u201d Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant, congrat \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, we\u2019ll have time for a cozy catch-up later!\u201d roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen. Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. \u201cAs Dedalus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He\u2019s made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother\u2019s charm does that already. What he\u2019s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.\n\n\u201cSecond problem: You\u2019re underage, which means you\u2019ve still got the Trace on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Trace, the Trace!\u201d said Mad-Eye impatiently. \u201cThe charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you\u2019ll lose all the protection your mother gave you. In short: Pius Thicknesse thinks he\u2019s got you cornered good and proper.\u201d\n\nHarry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.\n\n\u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can\u2019t detect, because we don\u2019t need to cast spells to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid\u2019s motorbike.\u201d\n\nHarry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to address them.\n\n\u201cNow, your mother\u2019s charm will only break under two conditions: when you come of age, or\u201d \u2014 Moody gestured around the pristine kitchen \u2014 \u201cyou no longer call this place home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding that you\u2019re never going to live together again, correct?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cSo this time, when you leave, there\u2019ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We\u2019re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.\n\n\u201cThe one thing we\u2019ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn\u2019t know we\u2019re moving you tonight. We\u2019ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry: They think you\u2019re not leaving until the thirtieth. However, this is You-Know-Who we\u2019re dealing with, so we can\u2019t just rely on him getting the date wrong; he\u2019s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So, we\u2019ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all look like they could be the place we\u2019re going to hide you, they\u2019ve all got some connection with the Order: my house, Kingsley\u2019s place, Molly\u2019s Auntie Muriel\u2019s \u2014 you get the idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be going to Tonks\u2019s parents. Once you\u2019re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we\u2019ve put on their house, you\u2019ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMaybe they won\u2019t know which of the twelve secure houses I\u2019m heading for at first, but won\u2019t it be sort of obvious once\u201d \u2014 he performed a quick headcount \u2014 \u201cfourteen of us fly off toward Tonks\u2019s parents\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Moody, \u201cI forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won\u2019t be flying to Tonks\u2019s parents\u2019. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.\u201d\n\nFrom inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. \u201cNo way!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told them you\u2019d take it like this,\u201d said Hermione with a hint of complacency.\n\n\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to let six people risk their lives \u2014 !\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 because it\u2019s the first time for all of us,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThis is different, pretending to be me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, none of us really fancy it, Harry,\u201d said Fred earnestly. \u201cImagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.\u201d\n\nHarry did not smile.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do it if I don\u2019t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s that plan scuppered,\u201d said George. \u201cObviously there\u2019s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who\u2019s not allowed to use magic; we\u2019ve got no chance,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d said Harry, \u201creally amusing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it has to come to force, then it will,\u201d growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry. \u201cEveryone here\u2019s overage, Potter, and they\u2019re all prepared to take the risk.\u201d\n\nMundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moody\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have no more arguments. Time\u2019s wearing on. I want a few of your hairs, boy, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is mad, there\u2019s no need \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need!\u201d snarled Moody. \u201cWith You-Know-Who out there and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we\u2019re lucky he\u2019ll have swallowed the fake bait and he\u2019ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth, but he\u2019d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it\u2019s what I\u2019d do. They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother\u2019s charm holds, but it\u2019s about to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can\u2019t split himself into seven.\u201d\n\nHarry caught Hermione\u2019s eye and looked away at once.\n\n\u201cSo, Potter \u2014 some of your hair, if you please.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way.\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d barked Moody.\n\nWith all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion. \u201cStraight in here, if you please.\u201d\n\nHarry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold.\n\n\u201cOoh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, before catching sight of Ron\u2019s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, \u201cOh, you know what I mean \u2014 Goyle\u2019s potion looked like bogies.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight then, fake Potters line up over here, please,\u201d said Moody.\n\nRon, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia\u2019s gleaming sink.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one short,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred and George instead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve toldjer, I\u2019d sooner be a protector,\u201d said Mundungus.\n\n\u201cShut it,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cAs I\u2019ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would want to finish Potter in person. It\u2019ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, the Death Eaters\u2019ll want to kill them.\u201d\n\nMundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion into each one.\n\n\u201cAltogether, then . . .\u201d\n\nRon, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats: At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione\u2019s and Fleur\u2019s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls.\n\nMoody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of him.\n\nFred and George turned to each other and said together, \u201cWow \u2014 we\u2019re identical!\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, though, I think I\u2019m still better-looking,\u201d said Fred, examining his reflection in the kettle.\n\n\u201cBah,\u201d said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, \u201cBill, don\u2019t look at me \u2014 I\u2019m \u2019ideous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose whose clothes are a bit roomy, I\u2019ve got smaller here,\u201d said Moody, indicating the first sack, \u201cand vice versa. Don\u2019t forget the glasses, there\u2019s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you\u2019re dressed, there\u2019s luggage in the other sack.\u201d\n\nThe real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly much more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own.\n\n\u201cI knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,\u201d said Ron, looking down at his bare chest.\n\n\u201cHarry, your eyesight really is awful,\u201d said Hermione, as she put on glasses.\n\nOnce dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden Harrys faced him. \u201cThe pairs will be as follows: Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019m I with you?\u201d grunted the Harry nearest the back door.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re the one that needs watching,\u201d growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, \u201cArthur and Fred \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m George,\u201d said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. \u201cCan\u2019t you even tell us apart when we\u2019re Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, George \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only yanking your wand, I\u2019m Fred really \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough messing around!\u201d snarled Moody. \u201cThe other one \u2014 George or Fred or whoever you are \u2014 you\u2019re with Remus. Miss Delacour \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking Fleur on a thestral,\u201d said Bill. \u201cShe\u2019s not that fond of brooms.\u201d\n\nFleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slavish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again.\n\n\u201cMiss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley\u2019s smile; Harry knew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick.\n\n\u201cWhich leaves you and me, Ron!\u201d said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him.\n\nRon did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 you\u2019re with me, Harry. That all righ\u2019?\u201d said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on the bike, brooms an\u2019 thestrals can\u2019t take me weight, see. Not a lot o\u2019 room on the seat with me on it, though, so you\u2019ll be in the sidecar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Harry, not altogether truthfully.\n\n\u201cWe think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,\u201d said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. \u201cSnape\u2019s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he\u2019s never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we\u2019re betting they\u2019ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a broomstick. All right then,\u201d he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters\u2019 clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, \u201cI make it three minutes until we\u2019re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won\u2019t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking. . . . Come on. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry hurried into the hall to fetch his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig\u2019s cage before joining the others in the dark back garden. On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike, goggles on.\n\n\u201cIs this it? Is this Sirius\u2019s bike?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very same,\u201d said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. \u201cAn\u2019 the last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!\u201d\n\nHarry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig\u2019s cage between his knees. It was extremely uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cArthur\u2019s done a bit o\u2019 tinkerin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry\u2019s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s got a few tricks up its handlebars now. Tha\u2019 one was my idea.\u201d\n\nHe pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer.\n\n\u201cPlease be careful, Hagrid,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his broomstick. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure that was advisable and it\u2019s certainly only to be used in emergencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right then,\u201d said Moody. \u201cEveryone ready, please; I want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion\u2019s lost.\u201d\n\nEverybody mounted their brooms.\n\n\u201cHold tight now, Ron,\u201d said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life: It roared like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate.\n\n\u201cGood luck, everyone,\u201d shouted Moody. \u201cSee you all in about an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three. One . . . two . . . THREE.\u201d\n\nThere was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch: He was rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig\u2019s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and higher they climbed into the sky \u2014\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen, oblivious \u2014\n\nScreams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they were: Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig\u2019s cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees \u2014\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 HEDWIG!\u201d\n\nThe broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second\u2019s relief, and then another burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 NO!\u201d\n\nThe motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.\n\n\u201cHedwig \u2014 Hedwig \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could not take it in, and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were \u2014\n\n\u201cHagrid, we\u2019ve got to go back, we\u2019ve got to go back!\u201d he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig\u2019s cage onto the floor, refusing to believe that she was dead. \u201cHagrid, TURN AROUND!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy job\u2019s ter get you there safe, Harry!\u201d bellowed Hagrid, and he opened the throttle.\n\n\u201cStop \u2014 STOP!\u201d Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for Hagrid\u2019s broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around he cried, \u201cStupefy!\u201d and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it.\n\n\u201cHold on, Harry, this\u2019ll do for \u2019em!\u201d roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge.\n\nA wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky: He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up.\n\nMore Killing Curses flew past Harry\u2019s head from the two remaining Death Eaters\u2019 wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what was happening \u2014\n\n\u201cHere we go again, Harry, hold on!\u201d yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second button. This time a great net burst from the bike\u2019s exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all shooting curses after it.\n\n\u201cThis\u2019ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!\u201d yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer.\n\nWith an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all righ\u2019, Harry!\u201d bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto his back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike\u2019s slipstream.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on it, Harry, don\u2019 worry!\u201d Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella.\n\n\u201cHagrid! No! Let me!\u201d\n\n\u201cREPARO!\u201d\n\nThere was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely: Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike\u2019s flight, then the sidecar began to lose height \u2014\n\nIn desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d\n\nThe sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne: He had but a split second\u2019s relief, however, as more curses streaked past him: The three Death Eaters were closing in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019, Harry!\u201d Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled, \u201cImpedimenta!\u201d\n\nThe jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him \u2014\n\nThen the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat \u2014\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019, Harry, I\u2019m comin\u2019!\u201d\n\nA huge hand seized the back of Harry\u2019s robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike\u2019s seat and found himself back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, \u201cConfringo!\u201d\n\nHe knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished.\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d moaned Hagrid, \u201cI shouldn\u2019ta tried ter repair it meself \u2014 yeh\u2019ve got no room \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, just keep flying!\u201d Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer.\n\nAs the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike \u2014 Stan \u2014\n\n\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him, it\u2019s him, it\u2019s the real one!\u201d\n\nThe hooded Death Eater\u2019s shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbike\u2019s engine: Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view.\n\n\u201cHarry, what\u2019s happened?\u201d bellowed Hagrid. \u201cWhere\u2019ve they gone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nBut Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted \u201cIt\u2019s the real one!\u201d; how had he known? He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they?\n\nHe clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid\u2019s jacket.\n\n\u201cHagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on tight, then, Harry!\u201d\n\nThere was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backward off what little of the seat he had, Hagrid flung backward upon him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars \u2014\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve lost \u2019em Harry, I think we\u2019ve done it!\u201d yelled Hagrid.\n\nBut Harry was not convinced: Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come. . . . Why had they fallen back? One of them had still had a wand. . . . It\u2019s him . . . it\u2019s the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan. . . .\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nearly there, Harry, we\u2019ve nearly made it!\u201d shouted Hagrid.\n\nHarry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars.\n\nThen the scar on his forehead burned like fire; as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind \u2014\n\nAnd then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snakelike face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his wand again \u2014\n\nHagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control \u2014\n\nGreen jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him, he saw it raise its arm \u2014\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d\n\nWith a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the broomstick \u2014\n\nBarely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Voldemort scream, \u201cMine!\u201d\n\nIt was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard, \u201cAvada \u2014\u201d\n\nAs the pain from Harry\u2019s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, \u201cNo!\u201d: Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the ground.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. \u201cHagrid \u2014 Accio Hagrid!\u201d\n\nThe motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, \u201cYour wand, Selwyn, give me your wand!\u201d\n\nHe felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw: Voldemort preparing to curse him once more \u2014\n\nAnd then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an earsplitting, ground-trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter5": "FALLEN WARRIOR\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHagrid?\u201d\n\nHarry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand. He could not understand where Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment. Something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid.\n\n\u201cHagrid? Hagrid, talk to me \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the dark mass did not stir.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry did not recognize the man\u2019s voice. Then a woman shouted, \u201cThey\u2019ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in the garden!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s head was swimming.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled.\n\nThe next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was still throbbing.\n\n\u201cHagrid?\u201d\n\nHe opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man was watching Harry anxiously.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s fine, son,\u201d said the man, \u201cthe wife\u2019s seeing to him now. How are you feeling? Anything else broken? I\u2019ve fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I\u2019m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks \u2014 Dora\u2019s father.\u201d\n\nHarry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy.\n\n\u201cVoldemort \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy, now,\u201d said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions. \u201cThat was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. \u201cDeath Eaters, loads of them \u2014 we were chased \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath Eaters?\u201d said Ted sharply. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, Death Eaters? I thought they didn\u2019t know you were being moved tonight, I thought \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey knew,\u201d said Harry.\n\nTed Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above.\n\n\u201cWell, we know our protective charms hold, then, don\u2019t we? They shouldn\u2019t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction.\u201d\n\nNow Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order\u2019s charms. He only hoped they would continue to work: He imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble.\n\nHe swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but miraculously alive.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nKnocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs. \u201cBlimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o\u2019 that? I thought we were both goners.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, me too. I can\u2019t believe \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty.\n\n\u201cYour wand\u2019s here, son,\u201d said Ted, tapping it on Harry\u2019s arm. \u201cIt fell right beside you, I picked it up. And that\u2019s my wife you\u2019re shouting at.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nAs she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks\u2019s resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a light, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry\u2019s exclamation.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to our daughter?\u201d she asked. \u201cHagrid said you were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened to anyone else.\u201d\n\nShe and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their expressions; if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the plan, given them his hair. . . .\n\n\u201cThe Portkey,\u201d he said, remembering all of a sudden. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to the Burrow and find out \u2014 then we\u2019ll be able to send you word, or \u2014 or Tonks will, once she\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDora\u2019ll be okay, \u2019Dromeda,\u201d said Ted. \u201cShe knows her stuff, she\u2019s been in plenty of tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey\u2019s through here,\u201d he added to Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we do,\u201d said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. \u201cI \u2014\u201d\n\nHe looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that did not seem hollow and insincere.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell Tonks \u2014 Dora \u2014 to send word, when she . . . Thanks for patching us up, thanks for everything. I \u2014\u201d\n\nHe was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel.\n\n\u201cThere you go, son. That\u2019s the Portkey.\u201d\n\nMr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying on the dressing table.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave.\n\n\u201cWait a moment,\u201d said Hagrid, looking around. \u201cHarry, where\u2019s Hedwig?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe . . . she got hit,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the Dursleys.\n\nHagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cNever mind. She had a great old life \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time.\n\nWith a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Seconds later Harry\u2019s feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet.\n\n\u201cHarry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?\u201d cried Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean? Isn\u2019t anyone else back?\u201d Harry panted.\n\nThe answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley\u2019s pale face.\n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters were waiting for us,\u201d Harry told her. \u201cWe were surrounded the moment we took off \u2014 they knew it was tonight \u2014 I don\u2019t know what happened to anyone else, four of them chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us \u2014\u201d\n\nHe could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons, but \u2014\n\n\u201cThank goodness you\u2019re all right,\u201d she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t go\u2019 any brandy, have yeh, Molly?\u201d asked Hagrid a little shakily. \u201cFer medicinal purposes?\u201d\n\nShe could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the crooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once.\n\n\u201cRon and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it came back without them,\u201d she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. \u201cAnd that one,\u201d she pointed at an ancient sneaker, \u201cshould have been Dad and Fred\u2019s, they were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,\u201d she checked her watch, \u201cif they made it, George and Lupin ought to be back in about a minute.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. He uncorked it and drank it straight down in one.\n\n\u201cMum!\u201d shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away.\n\nA blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong: Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood.\n\nHarry ran forward and seized George\u2019s legs. Together, he and Lupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the sitting room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell across George\u2019s head, Ginny gasped and Harry\u2019s stomach lurched: One of George\u2019s ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood.\n\nNo sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door.\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d said Hagrid indignantly. \u201cLe\u2019 go of him! Le\u2019 go of Harry!\u201d\n\nLupin ignored him.\n\n\u201cWhat creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?\u201d he said, giving Harry a small shake. \u201cAnswer me!\u201d\n\n\u201cA \u2014 a grindylow in a tank, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nLupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard.\n\n\u201cWha\u2019 was tha\u2019 about?\u201d roared Hagrid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry, but I had to check,\u201d said Lupin tersely. \u201cWe\u2019ve been betrayed. Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why aren\u2019 you checkin\u2019 me?\u201d panted Hagrid, still struggling to fit through the door.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re half-giant,\u201d said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. \u201cThe Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight,\u201d said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. \u201cVoldemort only caught up with me toward the end, he didn\u2019t know which one I was in the beginning. If he\u2019d been in on the plan he\u2019d have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort caught up with you?\u201d said Lupin sharply. \u201cWhat happened? How did you escape?\u201d\n\nHarry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks\u2019s parents.\n\n\u201cThey recognized you? But how? What had you done?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . .\u201d Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. \u201cI saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to Disarm him instead of \u2014 well, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, does he? He must be Imperiused!\u201d\n\nLupin looked aghast.\n\n\u201cHarry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren\u2019t prepared to kill!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were hundreds of feet up! Stan\u2019s not himself, and if I Stunned him and he\u2019d fallen, he\u2019d have died the same as if I\u2019d used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,\u201d Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore\u2019s Army how to Disarm.\n\n\u201cYes, Harry,\u201d said Lupin with painful restraint, \u201cand a great number of Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under imminent threat of death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cbut the Death Eaters \u2014 frankly, most people! \u2014 would have expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!\u201d\n\nLupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t blast people out of my way just because they\u2019re there,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat\u2019s Voldemort\u2019s job.\u201d\n\nLupin\u2019s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again.\n\n\u201cWill George be okay?\u201d\n\nAll Lupin\u2019s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question.\n\n\u201cI think so, although there\u2019s no chance of replacing his ear, not when it\u2019s been cursed off \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt over Hagrid\u2019s legs and sprinted into the yard.\n\nTwo figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermione flung herself into Harry\u2019s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione\u2019s shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cThe last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,\u2019\u201d said Lupin calmly.\n\nKingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, \u201cIt\u2019s him, I\u2019ve checked!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak. \u201cBut somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it seems,\u201d replied Lupin, \u201cbut apparently they did not realize that there would be seven Harrys.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall comfort!\u201d snarled Kingsley. \u201cWho else is back?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.\u201d\n\nHermione stifled a little moan behind her hand.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Lupin asked Kingsley.\n\n\u201cFollowed by five, injured two, might\u2019ve killed one,\u201d Kingsley reeled off, \u201cand we saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFly,\u201d supplied Harry. \u201cI saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why he left, to follow you!\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d vanished. But what made him change targets?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cStan?\u201d repeated Hermione. \u201cBut I thought he was in Azkaban?\u201d\n\nKingsley let out a mirthless laugh.\n\n\u201cHermione, there\u2019s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up. Travers\u2019s hood fell off when I cursed him, he\u2019s supposed to be inside too. But what happened to you, Remus? Where\u2019s George?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe lost an ear,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cLost an \u2014 ?\u201d repeated Hermione in a high voice.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s work,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cSnape?\u201d shouted Harry. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a speciality of Snape\u2019s. I wish I could say I\u2019d paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was injured, he was losing so much blood.\u201d\n\nSilence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus?\n\n\u201cHarry, give us a hand!\u201d called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free, then headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw a clean, gaping hole where George\u2019s ear had been.\n\n\u201cHow is he?\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley looked around and said, \u201cI can\u2019t make it grow back, not when it\u2019s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been so much worse. . . . He\u2019s alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThank God.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I hear someone else in the yard?\u201d Ginny asked.\n\n\u201cHermione and Kingsley,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThank goodness,\u201d Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I\u2019ve seen my son, now back off if you know what\u2019s good for you!\u201d\n\nHarry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured.\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d sobbed Mrs. Weasley. \u201cOh thank goodness!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is he?\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin\u2019s wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing.\n\nPerhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father\u2019s arrival, George stirred.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel, Georgie?\u201d whispered Mrs. Weasley.\n\nGeorge\u2019s fingers groped for the side of his head.\n\n\u201cSaintlike,\u201d he murmured.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d croaked Fred, looking terrified. \u201cIs his mind affected?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaintlike,\u201d repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. \u201cYou see . . . I\u2019m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred\u2019s pale face.\n\n\u201cPathetic,\u201d he told George. \u201cPathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh well,\u201d said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.\u201d\n\nHe looked around.\n\n\u201cHi, Harry \u2014 you are Harry, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d said Harry, moving closer to the sofa.\n\n\u201cWell, at least we got you back okay,\u201d said George. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not back yet, George,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. George\u2019s grin faded. Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside. As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice,\n\n\u201cRon and Tonks should be back by now. They didn\u2019t have a long journey; Auntie Muriel\u2019s not that far from here.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand.\n\nKingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time he turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.\n\nThe minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves \u2014\n\nAnd then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground \u2014\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s them!\u201d screamed Hermione.\n\nTonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere.\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin\u2019s arms. His face was set and white: He seemed unable to speak. Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly.\n\n\u201cI thought \u2014 I thought \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019M all right,\u201d said Ron, patting her on the back. \u201c\u2019M fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon was great,\u201d said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. \u201cWonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you\u2019re aiming at a moving target from a flying broom \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck.\n\n\u201cAlways the tone of surprise,\u201d he said a little grumpily, breaking free. \u201cAre we the last back?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ginny, \u201cwe\u2019re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I\u2019m going to tell Mum and Dad you\u2019re okay, Ron \u2014\u201d\n\nShe ran back inside.\n\n\u201cSo what kept you? What happened?\u201d Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks.\n\n\u201cBellatrix,\u201d said Tonks. \u201cShe wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus, she tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I\u2019d got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus. . . . Then we got to Ron\u2019s Auntie Muriel\u2019s and we\u2019d missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us \u2014\u201d\n\nA muscle was jumping in Lupin\u2019s jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else.\n\n\u201cSo what happened to you lot?\u201d Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley.\n\nThey recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the continued absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder to ignore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago,\u201d said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. \u201cLet me know when they\u2019re back.\u201d\n\nLupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow\u2019s boundaries.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them. Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, \u201cfor our sons.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Molly,\u201d said Tonks at once.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s George?\u201d asked Lupin.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d piped up Ron.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the end of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s sentence was drowned in a general outcry: A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but unhurt.\n\n\u201cBill! Thank God, thank God \u2014\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. Looking directly at his father, he said, \u201cMad-Eye\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nNobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside him was falling, falling through the earth, leaving him forever.\n\n\u201cWe saw it,\u201d said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. \u201cIt happened just after we broke out of the circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort \u2014 he can fly \u2014 went straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort\u2019s curse hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and \u2014 there was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our own tail \u2014\u201d\n\nBill\u2019s voice broke.\n\n\u201cOf course you couldn\u2019t have done anything,\u201d said Lupin.\n\nThey all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend it. Mad-Eye dead; it could not be. . . . Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor . . .\n\nAt last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. and Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened? Who\u2019s \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cMad-Eye,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cDead.\u201d\n\nThe twins\u2019 grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief: She had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief.\n\nBill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of firewhisky and some glasses.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. \u201cMad-Eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cMad-Eye,\u201d they all said, and drank.\n\n\u201cMad-Eye,\u201d echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup.\n\nThe firewhisky seared Harry\u2019s throat. It seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing him with something that was like courage.\n\n\u201cSo Mundungus disappeared?\u201d said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one.\n\nThe atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they might hear.\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d said Bill, \u201cand I wondered that too, on the way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn\u2019t they? But Mundungus can\u2019t have betrayed us. They didn\u2019t know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case you\u2019ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn\u2019t he have told them the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it\u2019s as simple as that. He didn\u2019t want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who went straight for them. It was enough to make anyone panic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,\u201d sniffed Tonks. \u201cMad-Eye said he\u2019d expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and zat eez all very good,\u201d snapped Fleur, \u201cbut still eet does not explain \u2019ow zey knew we were moving \u2019Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must \u2019ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze \u2019ole plan.\u201d\n\nShe glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face, silently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked his own life to save Harry\u2019s \u2014 Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon\u2019s egg. . . .\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised: The firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. \u201cI mean . . . if somebody made a mistake,\u201d Harry went on, \u201cand let something slip, I know they didn\u2019t mean to do it. It\u2019s not their fault,\u201d he repeated, again a little louder than he would usually have spoken. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don\u2019t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort.\u201d\n\nMore silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye had always been scathing about Dumbledore\u2019s willingness to trust people.\n\n\u201cWell said, Harry,\u201d said Fred unexpectedly.\n\n\u201cYeah, \u2019ear, \u2019ear,\u201d said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose mouth twitched.\n\nLupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close to pitying.\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m a fool?\u201d demanded Harry.\n\n\u201cNo, I think you\u2019re like James,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cwho would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.\u201d\n\nHarry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been betrayed by his friend, Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set down his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, \u201cThere\u2019s work to do. I can ask Kingsley whether \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Bill at once, \u201cI\u2019ll do it, I\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d said Tonks and Fleur together.\n\n\u201cMad-Eye\u2019s body,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cWe need to recover it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t it \u2014 ?\u201d began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill.\n\n\u201cWait?\u201d said Bill. \u201cNot unless you\u2019d rather the Death Eaters took it?\u201d\n\nNobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good-bye and left.\n\nThe rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go too,\u201d said Harry.\n\nTen pairs of startled eyes looked at him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Harry,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay here.\u201d\n\nHe rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, it had not hurt like this for more than a year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all in danger while I\u2019m here. I don\u2019t want \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t be so silly!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cThe whole point of tonight was to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur\u2019s agreed to get married here rather than in France, we\u2019ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you \u2014\u201d\n\nShe did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better.\n\n\u201cIf Voldemort finds out I\u2019m here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why should he?\u201d asked Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cThere are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cHe\u2019s got no way of knowing which safe house you\u2019re in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me I\u2019m worried for!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWe know that,\u201d said Mr. Weasley quietly, \u201cbut it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left.\u201d\n\n\u201cYer not goin\u2019 anywhere,\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cBlimey, Harry, after all we wen\u2019 through ter get you here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, what about my bleeding ear?\u201d said George, hoisting himself up on his cushions.\n\n\u201cI know that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMad-Eye wouldn\u2019t want \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI KNOW!\u201d Harry bellowed.\n\nHe felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think he did not know what they had done for him, didn\u2019t they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now, before they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Hedwig, Harry?\u201d she said coaxingly. \u201cWe can put her up with Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat.\u201d\n\nHis insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering.\n\n\u201cWait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cEscaped him, fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d said Harry flatly. \u201cIt was my wand. My wand acted of its own accord.\u201d\n\nAfter a few moments, Hermione said gently, \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible, Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe bike was falling, I couldn\u2019t have told you where Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn\u2019t even a spell I recognized. I\u2019ve never made gold flames appear before.\u201d\n\n\u201cOften,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, \u201cwhen you\u2019re in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they\u2019re trained \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning: He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort\u2019s.\n\nNo one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before.\n\nHis scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room.\n\nAs he crossed the dark yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up, rustled its enormous batlike wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore.\n\nDumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have known how and why Harry\u2019s wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and Voldemort\u2019s . . . But Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all were gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky. . . .\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head.\n\n\u201cYou told me the problem would be solved by using another\u2019s wand!\u201d\n\nAnd into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible, drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony. . . .\n\n\u201cNo! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not. . . . I swear I did not. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear I did not . . . I believed a different wand would work. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cExplain, then, what happened. Lucius\u2019s wand is destroyed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot understand . . . The connection . . . exists only . . . between your two wands. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLies!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease . . . I beg you. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort\u2019s surge of vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in agony \u2014\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\nIt was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realized that Ron and Hermione were at his side.\n\n\u201cHarry, come back in the house,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cYou aren\u2019t still thinking of leaving?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve got to stay, mate,\u201d said Ron, thumping Harry on the back.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry\u2019s face. \u201cYou look awful!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry shakily, \u201cI probably look better than Ollivander. . . .\u201d\n\nWhen he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled, but Hermione downright terrified.\n\n\u201cBut it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar \u2014 it wasn\u2019t supposed to do this anymore! You mustn\u2019t let that connection open up again \u2014 Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!\u201d\n\nWhen he did not reply, she gripped his arm.\n\n\u201cHarry, he\u2019s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world! Don\u2019t let him inside your head too!\u201d"}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter6": "THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS\n\n\n\n\nThe shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that followed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order members, who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t do anything about the\u201d \u2014 Ron mouthed the word Horcruxes \u2014 \u201ctill you\u2019re seventeen. You\u2019ve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can\u2019t we? Or,\u201d he dropped his voice to a whisper, \u201cd\u2019you reckon you already know where the You-Know-Whats are?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry admitted.\n\n\u201cI think Hermione\u2019s been doing a bit of research,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShe said she was saving it for when you got here.\u201d\n\nThey were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.\n\n\u201cThe Trace\u2019ll break on the thirty-first,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat means I only need to stay here four days. Then I can \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFive days,\u201d Ron corrected him firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay for the wedding. They\u2019ll kill us if we miss it.\u201d\n\nHarry understood \u201cthey\u201d to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one extra day,\u201d said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they realize how important \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course they don\u2019t,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got a clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.\u201d\n\nRon glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.\n\n\u201cMum\u2019s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we\u2019re off to do. She\u2019ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin\u2019ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She\u2019s determined.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man\u2019s sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen, she started.\n\n\u201cRon and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,\u201d she began in a light, casual tone.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, yeah. We are.\u201d\n\nThe mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like one of Mr. Weasley\u2019s vests.\n\n\u201cMay I ask why you are abandoning your education?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cWell, Dumbledore left me . . . stuff to do,\u201d mumbled Harry. \u201cRon and Hermione know about it, and they want to come too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of \u2018stuff\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I\u2019m sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would agree!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had been afraid of the \u201cconcerned parent\u201d attack. He forced himself to look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny\u2019s. This did not help.\n\n\u201cDumbledore didn\u2019t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I\u2019m sorry. Ron and Hermione don\u2019t have to come, it\u2019s their choice \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that you have to go either!\u201d she snapped, dropping all pretense now. \u201cYou\u2019re barely of age, any of you! It\u2019s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t misunderstand,\u201d said Harry flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be me.\u201d\n\nHe handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not mine, I don\u2019t support Puddlemere United.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course not,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone. \u201cI should have realized. Well, Harry, while we\u2019ve still got you here, you won\u2019t mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur\u2019s wedding, will you? There\u2019s still so much to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 I \u2014 of course not,\u201d said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of subject.\n\n\u201cSweet of you,\u201d she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery.\n\nFrom that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron, and Hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey. After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canap\u00e9s, however, Harry started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander.\n\n\u201cI think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she\u2019ll be able to delay you leaving,\u201d Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay.\n\n\u201cAnd then what does she think\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cSomeone else might kill off Voldemort while she\u2019s holding us here making vol-au-vents?\u201d\n\nHe had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny\u2019s face whiten.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 not \u2014 I was joking,\u201d said Harry evasively.\n\nThey stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny\u2019s expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in.\n\nThey were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Place\u2019s location had become a Secret-Keeper in turn.\n\n\u201cAnd as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can\u2019t expect it to hold much longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again. We hope they\u2019ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we can\u2019t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky.\u201d\n\nThe kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken.\n\n\u201cNo news about Mad-Eye?\u201d Harry asked Bill.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Bill.\n\nThey had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the battle.\n\n\u201cThe Daily Prophet hasn\u2019t said a word about him dying or about finding the body,\u201d Bill went on. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean much. It\u2019s keeping a lot quiet these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they still haven\u2019t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death Eaters?\u201d Harry called across the table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head.\n\n\u201cBecause they know I had no choice or because they don\u2019t want me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn\u2019t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban\u2019s seen a mass breakout.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, why tell the public the truth?\u201d said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?\u201d asked Ron angrily.\n\n\u201cOf course, Ron, but people are terrified,\u201d Mr. Weasley replied, \u201cterrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one don\u2019t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn\u2019t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day: I just hope he\u2019s working on a plan.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart.\n\n\u201cWe must decide \u2019ow you will be disguised, \u2019Arry,\u201d said Fleur, once everyone had pudding. \u201cFor ze wedding,\u201d she added, when he looked confused. \u201cOf course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey \u2019ave \u2019ad champagne.\u201d\n\nFrom this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid.\n\n\u201cYes, good point,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table, where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. \u201cNow, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. \u201cWhy does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are holding your brother\u2019s wedding here in a few days\u2019 time, young man \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd are they getting married in my bedroom?\u201d asked Ron furiously. \u201cNo! So why in the name of Merlin\u2019s saggy left \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to your mother like that,\u201d said Mr. Weasley firmly. \u201cAnd do as you\u2019re told.\u201d\n\nRon scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.\n\n\u201cI can help, some of it\u2019s my mess,\u201d Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across him.\n\n\u201cNo, Harry, dear, I\u2019d much rather you helped Arthur muck out the chickens, and Hermione, I\u2019d be ever so grateful if you\u2019d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they\u2019re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nBut as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,\u201d Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, \u201cbut, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius\u2019s bike and, er, I\u2019m hiding \u2014 that\u2019s to say, keeping \u2014 it in here. Fantastic stuff: There\u2019s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it\u2019s called, the most magnificent battery, and it\u2019ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I\u2019m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly\u2019s not \u2014 I mean, when I\u2019ve got time.\u201d\n\nWhen they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron\u2019s attic bedroom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m doing \u2014 ! Oh, it\u2019s you,\u201d said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles.\n\n\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.\n\n\u201cAnd how did you manage to get away?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Ron\u2019s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,\u201d said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other.\n\n\u201cWe were just talking about Mad-Eye,\u201d Ron told Harry. \u201cI reckon he might have survived.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah, but Bill was under attack too,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHow can he be sure what he saw?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,\u201d said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand.\n\n\u201cHe could have used a Shield Charm \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, all right, if you want him to be dead,\u201d said Ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape.\n\n\u201cOf course we don\u2019t want him to be dead!\u201d said Hermione, looking shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s dreadful that he\u2019s dead! But we\u2019re being realistic!\u201d\n\nFor the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye\u2019s body, broken as Dumbledore\u2019s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh.\n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that\u2019s why no one\u2019s found him,\u201d said Ron wisely.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLike Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid\u2019s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman\u2019s Syllabary.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. \u201cHermione, I wasn\u2019t trying to upset \u2014\u201d\n\nBut with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, \u201cTergeo.\u201d\n\nThe wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I\u2019m sorry. . . .\u201d She blew her nose and hiccuped. \u201cIt\u2019s just so awf-ful, isn\u2019t it? R-right after Dumbledore . . . I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so tough!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Ron, giving her a squeeze. \u201cBut you know what he\u2019d say to us if he was here?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018C-constant vigilance,\u2019\u201d said Hermione, mopping her eyes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Ron, nodding. \u201cHe\u2019d tell us to learn from what happened to him. And what I\u2019ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.\u201d\n\nHermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at Ron\u2019s ankle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron\u2019s leg and retied it shut.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing with all those books anyway?\u201d Ron asked, limping back to his bed.\n\n\u201cJust trying to decide which ones to take with us,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking for the Horcruxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. \u201cI forgot we\u2019ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha,\u201d said Hermione, looking down at Spellman\u2019s Syllabary. \u201cI wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It\u2019s possible. . . . I think we\u2019d better take it, to be safe.\u201d\n\nShe dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts: A History.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance.\n\n\u201cI know you said after Dumbledore\u2019s funeral that you wanted to come with me,\u201d Harry began.\n\n\u201cHere he goes,\u201d Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.\n\n\u201cAs we knew he would,\u201d she sighed, turning back to the books. \u201cYou know, I think I will take Hogwarts: A History. Even if we\u2019re not going back there, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel right if I didn\u2019t have it with \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d said Harry again.\n\n\u201cNo, Harry, you listen,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe\u2019re coming with you. That was decided months ago \u2014 years, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Ron advised him.\n\n\u201c\u2014 are you sure you\u2019ve thought this through?\u201d Harry persisted.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. \u201cI\u2019ve been packing for days, so we\u2019re ready to leave at a moment\u2019s notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling Mad-Eye\u2019s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron\u2019s mum\u2019s nose.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve also modified my parents\u2019 memories so that they\u2019re convinced they\u2019re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life\u2019s ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That\u2019s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me \u2014 or you, because unfortunately, I\u2019ve told them quite a bit about you.\n\n\u201cAssuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I\u2019ll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don\u2019t \u2014 well, I think I\u2019ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don\u2019t know that they\u2019ve got a daughter, you see.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 Hermione, I\u2019m sorry \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, he\u2019s just eaten,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cGo on, he needs to know!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all right. Harry, come here.\u201d\n\nFor the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing.\n\n\u201cDescendo,\u201d muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your ghoul, isn\u2019t it?\u201d asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.\n\n\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d said Ron, climbing the ladder. \u201cCome and have a look at him.\u201d\n\nHarry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open.\n\n\u201cBut it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron. \u201cNor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules.\u201d\n\nHarry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry\u2019s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron\u2019s pajamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s me, see?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain it back in my room, the smell\u2019s getting to me,\u201d said Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.\n\n\u201cOnce we\u2019ve left, the ghoul\u2019s going to come and live down here in my room,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI think he\u2019s really looking forward to it \u2014 well, it\u2019s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool \u2014 but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he\u2019s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?\u201d\n\nHarry merely looked his confusion.\n\n\u201cIt is!\u201d said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan. \u201cLook, when we three don\u2019t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone\u2019s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they\u2019ve got information on where you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut hopefully it\u2019ll look like I\u2019ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t hide my whole family, it\u2019ll look too fishy and they can\u2019t all leave their jobs,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to put out the story that I\u2019m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can\u2019t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit\u2019s really contagious, so they\u2019re not going to want to go near him. It won\u2019t matter that he can\u2019t say anything, either, because apparently you can\u2019t once the fungus has spread to your uvula.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your mum and dad are in on this plan?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cDad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum . . . well, you\u2019ve seen what she\u2019s like. She won\u2019t accept we\u2019re going till we\u2019ve gone.\u201d\n\nThere was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other, unable to say anything. The measures they had taken to protect their families made him realize, more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find words important enough.\n\nThrough the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four floors below.\n\n\u201cGinny\u2019s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cFleur\u2019s sister\u2019s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she\u2019s too young to come on her own,\u201d said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee.\n\n\u201cWell, guests aren\u2019t going to help Mum\u2019s stress levels,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat we really need to decide,\u201d said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, \u201cis where we\u2019re going after we leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow first, Harry, and I understand why, but . . . well . . . shouldn\u2019t we make the Horcruxes our priority?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I\u2019d agree with you,\u201d said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to return to Godric\u2019s Hollow. His parents\u2019 graves were only part of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort\u2019s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened, wanting to understand.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think there\u2019s a possibility that Voldemort\u2019s keeping a watch on Godric\u2019s Hollow?\u201d Hermione asked. \u201cHe might expect you to go back and visit your parents\u2019 graves once you\u2019re free to go wherever you like?\u201d\n\nThis had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counterargument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of thought.\n\n\u201cThis R.A.B. person,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the one who stole the real locket?\u201d\n\nHermione nodded.\n\n\u201cHe said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nHarry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.\u2019s note was still folded.\n\n\u201c\u2018I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can,\u2019\u201d Harry read out.\n\n\u201cWell, what if he did finish it off?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOr she,\u201d interposed Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhichever,\u201d said Ron, \u201cit\u2019d be one less for us to do!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but we\u2019re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren\u2019t we?\u201d said Hermione, \u201cto find out whether or not it\u2019s destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cI\u2019ve been researching that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cI didn\u2019t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione, who had turned pink. \u201cDumbledore removed them all, but he \u2014 he didn\u2019t destroy them.\u201d\n\nRon sat up straight, wide-eyed.\n\n\u201cHow in the name of Merlin\u2019s pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt \u2014 it wasn\u2019t stealing!\u201d said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. \u201cThey were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn\u2019t want anyone to get at them, I\u2019m sure he would have made it much harder to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGet to the point!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell . . . it was easy,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice. \u201cI just did a Summoning Charm. You know \u2014 Accio. And \u2014 they zoomed out of Dumbledore\u2019s study window right into the girls\u2019 dormitory.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut when did you do this?\u201d Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity.\n\n\u201cJust after his \u2014 Dumbledore\u2019s \u2014 funeral,\u201d said Hermione in an even smaller voice. \u201cRight after we agreed we\u2019d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it \u2014 it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried . . . and it worked. They flew straight in through the open window and I \u2014 I packed them.\u201d\n\nShe swallowed and then said imploringly, \u201cI can\u2019t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you hear us complaining?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhere are these books anyway?\u201d\n\nHermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead.\n\n\u201cThis is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art \u2014 it\u2019s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library. . . . If he didn\u2019t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he\u2019d already read that?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cHe only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them. I think you\u2019re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he got the information.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the more I\u2019ve read about them,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cthe more horrible they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that\u2019s just by making one Horcrux!\u201d\n\nHarry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond \u201cusual evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there any way of putting yourself back together?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione with a hollow smile, \u201cbut it would be excruciatingly painful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? How do you do it?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cRemorse,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to really feel what you\u2019ve done. There\u2019s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can\u2019t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, before Harry could answer. \u201cSo does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, \u201cbecause it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I\u2019ve read, what Harry did to Riddle\u2019s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cOh well, lucky we\u2019ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI was wondering what we were going to do with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a basilisk fang,\u201d said Hermione patiently. \u201cIt has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can\u2019t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it\u2019s incredibly rare \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 phoenix tears,\u201d said Harry, nodding.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cOur problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they\u2019re all dangerous to carry around with you. That\u2019s a problem we\u2019re going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won\u2019t do the trick. You\u2019ve got to put it beyond magical repair.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut even if we wreck the thing it lives in,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwhy can\u2019t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.\u201d\n\nSeeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, \u201cLook, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn\u2019t damage your soul at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich would be a real comfort to me, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Ron. Harry laughed.\n\n\u201cIt should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut it\u2019s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can\u2019t exist without it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat diary sort of died when I stabbed it,\u201d said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort\u2019s soul as it vanished.\n\n\u201cAnd once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Ron, frowning. \u201cThe bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn\u2019t it? How does that work, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don\u2019t mean holding it for too long, it\u2019s nothing to do with touching it,\u201d she added before Ron could speak. \u201cI mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You\u2019re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I ask him? I never really . . .\u201d\n\nHis voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more . . . to find out everything. . . .\n\nThe silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,\u201d she said, her voice trembling. \u201cI\u2019m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books flying in every direction, \u201cwe will . . . we\u2019re sorry . . .\u201d\n\nWith an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being a house-elf,\u201d complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his head as he and Harry followed. \u201cExcept without the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding\u2019s over, the happier I\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthen we\u2019ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes. . . . It\u2019ll be like a holiday, won\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nRon started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley\u2019s room, stopped quite abruptly.\n\nThe Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o\u2019clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur\u2019s family by this time, and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors.\n\nHarry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes.\n\nHe had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green robes, who could only be Fleur\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cMaman!\u201d cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. \u201cPapa!\u201d\n\nMonsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing toward Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her flustered.\n\n\u201cYou \u2019ave been to much trouble,\u201d he said in a deep voice. \u201cFleur tells us you \u2019ave been working very \u2019ard.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s been nothing, nothing!\u201d trilled Mrs. Weasley. \u201cNo trouble at all!\u201d\n\nRon relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes.\n\n\u201cDear lady!\u201d said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley\u2019s hand between his own two plump ones and beaming. \u201cWe are most honored at the approaching union of our two families! Let me present my wife, Apolline.\u201d\n\nMadame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too.\n\n\u201cEnchant\u00e9e,\u201d she said. \u201cYour \u2019usband \u2019as been telling us such amusing stories!\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, you \u2019ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!\u201d said Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly.\n\n\u201cWell, come in, do!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, with many \u201cNo, please!\u201ds and \u201cAfter you!\u201ds and \u201cNot at all!\u201ds.\n\nThe Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids\u2019 shoes \u201cCharmant!\u201d Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid French.\n\nOn the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour\u2019s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy\u2019s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house.\n\n\u201cBut she still won\u2019t leave us alone!\u201d snarled Ron, as their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.\n\n\u201cOh, good, you\u2019ve fed the chickens,\u201d she called as she approached them. \u201cWe\u2019d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the wedding,\u201d she explained, pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. \u201cMillamant\u2019s Magic Marquees . . . they\u2019re very good, Bill\u2019s escorting them. . . . You\u2019d better stay inside while they\u2019re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these security spells around the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Harry humbly.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be silly, dear!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley at once. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2014 well, your safety\u2019s much more important! Actually, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it\u2019s an important day. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a fuss,\u201d said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain this would put on them all. \u201cReally, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine. . . . It\u2019s the day before the wedding. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, if you\u2019re sure, dear. I\u2019ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut please don\u2019t go to loads of trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all, not at all . . . It\u2019s no trouble. . . .\u201d\n\nShe looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened up, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter7": "THE WILL OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\n\n\n\nHe was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn. Far below, swathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down there, the man he needed so badly he could think of little else, the man who held the answer, the answer to his problem . . . ?\n\n\u201cOi, wake up.\u201d\n\nHarry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron\u2019s dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry\u2019s forehead was prickling.\n\n\u201cYou were muttering in your sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. \u2018Gregorovitch.\u2019 You kept saying \u2018Gregorovitch.\u2019\u201d\n\nHarry was not wearing his glasses; Ron\u2019s face appeared slightly blurred.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Gregorovitch?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.\u201d\n\nHarry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name before, but he could not think where.\n\n\u201cI think Voldemort\u2019s looking for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor bloke,\u201d said Ron fervently.\n\nHarry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s abroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho, Gregorovitch?\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort. I think he\u2019s somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn\u2019t look like anywhere in Britain.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou reckon you were seeing into his mind again?\u201d\n\nRon sounded worried.\n\n\u201cDo me a favor and don\u2019t tell Hermione,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAlthough how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep . . .\u201d\n\nHe gazed up at little Pigwidgeon\u2019s cage, thinking . . . Why was the name \u201cGregorovitch\u201d familiar?\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d he said slowly, \u201che\u2019s got something to do with Quidditch. There\u2019s some connection, but I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t think what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuidditch?\u201d said Ron. \u201cSure you\u2019re not thinking of Gorgovitch?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cDragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try not to either,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWell, happy birthday anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow \u2014 that\u2019s right, I forgot! I\u2019m seventeen!\u201d\n\nHarry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses, and said, \u201cAccio Glasses!\u201d Although they were only around a foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, at least until they poked him in the eye.\n\n\u201cSlick,\u201d snorted Ron.\n\nReveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron\u2019s possessions flying around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron\u2019s Chudley Cannons posters bright blue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d do your fly by hand, though,\u201d Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry immediately checked it. \u201cHere\u2019s your present. Unwrap it up here, it\u2019s not for my mother\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cA book?\u201d said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. \u201cBit of a departure from tradition, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t your average book,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s pure gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I\u2019d had this last year I\u2019d have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would\u2019ve known how to get going with . . . Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I\u2019ve learned a lot. You\u2019d be surprised, it\u2019s not all about wandwork, either.\u201d\n\nWhen they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. Bill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan.\n\n\u201cArthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. \u201cHe had to leave early for work, but he\u2019ll be back for dinner. That\u2019s our present on top.\u201d\n\nHarry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the face instead of hands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that one isn\u2019t new like Ron\u2019s, it was actually my brother Fabian\u2019s and he wasn\u2019t terribly careful with his possessions, it\u2019s a bit dented on the back, but \u2014\u201d\n\nThe rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor.\n\n\u201cHappy birthday, Harry!\u201d said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?\u201d she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her.\n\n\u201cCome on, then, open Hermione\u2019s!\u201d said Ron.\n\nShe had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (\u201cAh yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever \u2019ave,\u201d Monsieur Delacour assured him, \u201cbut you must tell it clearly what you want . . . ozzerwise you might find you \u2019ave a leetle less hair zan you would like. . . .\u201d), chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pack these for you,\u201d Hermione said brightly, taking Harry\u2019s presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. \u201cI\u2019m nearly done, I\u2019m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron \u2014\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing.\n\n\u201cHarry, will you come in here a moment?\u201d\n\nIt was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room.\n\nHe had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny\u2019s window.\n\nGinny looked up into Harry\u2019s face, took a deep breath, and said, \u201cHappy seventeenth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . thanks.\u201d\n\nShe was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it difficult to look back at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.\n\n\u201cNice view,\u201d he said feebly, pointing toward the window.\n\nShe ignored this. He could not blame her.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t think what to get you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to get me anything.\u201d\n\nShe disregarded this too.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn\u2019t be able to take it with you.\u201d\n\nHe chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up.\n\nShe took a step closer to him.\n\n\u201cSo then I thought, I\u2019d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you\u2019re off doing whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the silver lining I\u2019ve been looking for,\u201d she whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion, better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair \u2014\n\nThe door banged open behind them and they jumped apart.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Ron pointedly. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of breath. There was a strained silence, then Ginny said in a flat little voice,\n\n\u201cWell, happy birthday anyway, Harry.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone.\n\nHe looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom.\n\nRon marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared.\n\nOnce he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry.\n\n\u201cYou ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not messing her around,\u201d said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them.\n\n\u201cRon \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Ron held up a hand to silence her.\n\n\u201cShe was really cut up when you ended it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn\u2019t because I wanted to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but you go snogging her now and she\u2019s just going to get her hopes up again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not an idiot, she knows it can\u2019t happen, she\u2019s not expecting us to \u2014 to end up married, or \u2014\u201d\n\nAs he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry\u2019s mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger. In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and unencumbered, whereas his . . . he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead.\n\n\u201cIf you keep groping her every chance you get \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as though the sun had gone in. \u201cOkay?\u201d\n\nRon looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment, then said, \u201cRight then, well, that\u2019s . . . yeah.\u201d\n\nGinny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie\u2019s arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut.\n\nAs Harry\u2019s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow\u2019s kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns, all emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley\u2019s ministrations, George\u2019s wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins\u2019 many jokes about it.\n\nHermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes.\n\n\u201cNice,\u201d said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Ron!\u201d said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny\u2019s eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, out of the way!\u201d sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said,\n\n\u201cThat looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing, dear,\u201d she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one.\n\nBy seven o\u2019clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry\u2019s hand, Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant.\n\n\u201cHappy birthday, Harry,\u201d she said, hugging him tightly.\n\n\u201cSeventeen, eh!\u201d said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred. \u201cSix years ter the day since we met, Harry, d\u2019yeh remember it?\u201d\n\n\u201cVaguely,\u201d said Harry, grinning up at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig\u2019s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?\u201d\n\n\u201cI forge\u2019 the details,\u201d Hagrid chortled. \u201cAll righ\u2019, Ron, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAr, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns, I\u2019ll show yeh when yeh get back \u2014\u201d Harry avoided Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. \u201cHere, Harry \u2014 couldn\u2019 think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.\u201d He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. \u201cMokeskin. Hide anythin\u2019 in there an\u2019 no one but the owner can get it out. They\u2019re rare, them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, thanks!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019S\u2019nothin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. \u201cAn\u2019 there\u2019s Charlie! Always liked him \u2014 hey! Charlie!\u201d\n\nCharlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscley arms.\n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid, how\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\n\u201cBin meanin\u2019 ter write fer ages. How\u2019s Norbert doin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cNorbert?\u201d Charlie laughed. \u201cThe Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Norberta now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWha \u2014 Norbert\u2019s a girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Charlie.\n\n\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a lot more vicious,\u201d said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice. \u201cWish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum\u2019s getting edgy.\u201d\n\nThey all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019d better start without Arthur,\u201d she called to the garden at large after a moment or two. \u201cHe must have been held up at \u2014 oh!\u201d\n\nThey all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cMinister of Magic coming with me.\u201d\n\nThe Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur\u2019s family peering in astonishment at the place where it had vanished.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Lupin at once. \u201cHarry \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 I\u2019ll explain another time \u2014\u201d\n\nHe seized Tonks\u2019s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered.\n\n\u201cThe Minister \u2014 but why \u2014 ? I don\u2019t understand \u2014\u201d\n\nBut there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair.\n\nThe two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light, Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy and grim.\n\n\u201cSorry to intrude,\u201d said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. \u201cEspecially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party.\u201d\n\nHis eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake.\n\n\u201cMany happy returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI require a private word with you,\u201d Scrimgeour went on. \u201cAlso with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.\u201d\n\n\u201cUs?\u201d said Ron, sounding surprised. \u201cWhy us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cIs there such a place?\u201d he demanded of Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. \u201cThe, er, sitting room, why don\u2019t you use that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can lead the way,\u201d Scrimgeour said to Ron. \u201cThere will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.\u201d\n\nHarry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts.\n\nScrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy kitchen and into the Burrow\u2019s sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in here: Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke.\n\n\u201cI have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two\u201d \u2014 he pointed at Harry and Hermione \u2014 \u201ccan wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. \u201cYou can speak to us together, or not at all.\u201d\n\nScrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the Minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early.\n\n\u201cVery well then, together,\u201d he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. \u201cI am here, as I\u2019m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another.\n\n\u201cA surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cA-all of us?\u201d said Ron. \u201cMe and Hermione too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, all of \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Harry interrupted.\n\n\u201cDumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. \u201cThey wanted to examine whatever he\u2019s left us. You had no right to do that!\u201d she said, and her voice trembled slightly.\n\n\u201cI had every right,\u201d said Scrimgeour dismissively. \u201cThe Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cand the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased\u2019s possessions are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?\u201d asked Scrimgeour.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d retorted Hermione. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to do some good in the world!\u201d\n\nRon laughed. Scrimgeour\u2019s eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry spoke.\n\n\u201cSo why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can\u2019t think of a pretext to keep them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019ll be because the thirty-one days are up,\u201d said Hermione at once. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they\u2019re dangerous. Right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?\u201d asked Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled.\n\n\u201cMe? Not \u2014 not really . . . It was always Harry who . . .\u201d\n\nRon looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now! sort of look, but the damage was done: Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron\u2019s answer.\n\n\u201cIf you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions \u2014 his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects \u2014 were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . dunno,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI . . . when I say we weren\u2019t close . . . I mean, I think he liked me. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being modest, Ron,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cDumbledore was very fond of you.\u201d\n\nThis was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore\u2019 . . . Yes, here we are . . . \u2018To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it.\u2019\u201d\n\nScrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before: It looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in his fingers, looking stunned.\n\n\u201cThat is a valuable object,\u201d said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. \u201cIt may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore\u2019s own design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?\u201d\n\nRon shook his head, looking bewildered.\n\n\u201cDumbledore must have taught thousands of students,\u201d Scrimgeour persevered. \u201cYet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?\u201d\n\n\u201cPut out lights, I s\u2019pose,\u201d mumbled Ron. \u201cWhat else could I do with it?\u201d\n\nEvidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore\u2019s will.\n\n\u201c\u2018To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.\u2019\u201d\n\nScrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols.\n\n\u201cWhy do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?\u201d asked Scrimgeour.\n\n\u201cHe . . . he knew I liked books,\u201d said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve.\n\n\u201cBut why that particular book?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. He must have thought I\u2019d enjoy it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. \u201cAnd if the Ministry hasn\u2019t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will.\u201d\n\nShe suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione\u2019s shoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will.\n\n\u201c\u2018To Harry James Potter,\u2019\u201d he read, and Harry\u2019s insides contracted with a sudden excitement, \u201c\u2018I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax.\n\n\u201cWhy did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?\u201d asked Scrimgeour.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Harry. \u201cFor the reasons you just read out, I suppose . . . to remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere and whatever it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking the questions,\u201d said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge.\n\n\u201cI notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,\u201d Scrimgeour said to Harry. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d\n\nHermione laughed derisively.\n\n\u201cOh, it can\u2019t be a reference to the fact Harry\u2019s a great Seeker, that\u2019s way too obvious,\u201d she said. \u201cThere must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything hidden in the icing,\u201d said Scrimgeour, \u201cbut a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I\u2019m sure?\u201d\n\nHarry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge.\n\n\u201cBecause Snitches have flesh memories,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione\u2019s Quidditch knowledge negligible.\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cA Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch\u201d \u2014 he held up the tiny golden ball \u2014 \u201cwill remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister?\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say anything,\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cPerhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione\u2019s mind; he could practically hear her brain whirring beside him.\n\n\u201cTake it,\u201d said Scrimgeour quietly.\n\nHarry met the Minister\u2019s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry\u2019s palm.\n\nNothing happened. As Harry\u2019s fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way.\n\n\u201cThat was dramatic,\u201d said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all, then, is it?\u201d asked Hermione, making to prise herself off the sofa.\n\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d said Scrimgeour, who looked bad-tempered now. \u201cDumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Harry, excitement rekindling.\n\nScrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time.\n\n\u201cThe sword of Godric Gryffindor,\u201d he said.\n\nHermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain it.\n\n\u201cSo where is it?\u201d Harry asked suspiciously.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said Scrimgeour, \u201cthat sword was not Dumbledore\u2019s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt belongs to Harry!\u201d said Hermione hotly. \u201cIt chose him, he was the one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor,\u201d said Scrimgeour. \u201cThat does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.\u201d Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. \u201cWhy do you think \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?\u201d said Harry, struggling to keep his temper. \u201cMaybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a joke, Potter!\u201d growled Scrimgeour. \u201cWas it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting theory,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHas anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So is this what you\u2019ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying \u2014 I was nearly one of them \u2014 Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there\u2019s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go too far!\u201d shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand: It singed a hole in Harry\u2019s T-shirt like a lit cigarette.\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said,\n\n\u201cNo! D\u2019you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemembered you\u2019re not at school, have you?\u201d said Scrimgeour, breathing hard into Harry\u2019s face. \u201cRemembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It\u2019s time you learned some respect!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time you earned it,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in.\n\n\u201cWe \u2014 we thought we heard \u2014\u201d began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose.\n\n\u201c\u2014 raised voices,\u201d panted Mrs. Weasley.\n\nScrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had made in Harry\u2019s T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper.\n\n\u201cIt \u2014 it was nothing,\u201d he growled. \u201cI . . . regret your attitude,\u201d he said, looking Harry full in the face once more. \u201cYou seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you \u2014 what Dumbledore \u2014 desired. We ought to be working together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like your methods, Minister,\u201d said Harry. \u201cRemember?\u201d\n\nFor the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scars that still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies. Scrimgeour\u2019s expression hardened. He turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, \u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them.\n\n\u201cTo give us what Dumbledore left us,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey\u2019ve only just released the contents of his will.\u201d\n\nOutside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, \u201cHarry, dear, everyone\u2019s awfully hungry, we didn\u2019t like to start without you. . . . Shall I serve dinner now?\u201d\n\nThey all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field.\n\n\u201cMeet us upstairs,\u201d Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. \u201cAfter everyone\u2019s gone to bed.\u201d\n\nUp in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid\u2019s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the Marauder\u2019s Map, the shard of Sirius\u2019s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.\u2019s locket. He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside.\n\n\u201cMuffliato,\u201d she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs.\n\n\u201cThought you didn\u2019t approve of that spell?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cTimes change,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNow, show us that Deluminator.\u201d\n\nRon obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.\n\n\u201cThe thing is,\u201d whispered Hermione through the dark, \u201cwe could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.\u201d\n\nThere was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more.\n\n\u201cStill, it\u2019s cool,\u201d said Ron, a little defensively. \u201cAnd from what they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, but surely he wouldn\u2019t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he\u2019d left us?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, but that still doesn\u2019t explain . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . why he couldn\u2019t have given us a hint when he was alive?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, exactly,\u201d said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the Bard. \u201cIf these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you\u2019d think he\u2019d have let us know why . . . unless he thought it was obvious?\u201d\n\n\u201cThought wrong, then, didn\u2019t he?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI always said he was mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch \u2014 what the hell was that about?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWhen Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cThe Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?\u201d said Harry. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d\n\nHermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice.\n\n\u201cThat was the one you nearly swallowed!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch.\n\nIt did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out.\n\n\u201cWriting! There\u2019s writing on it, quick, look!\u201d\n\nHe nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledore\u2019s:\n\nI open at the close.\n\n\n\nHe had barely read them when the words vanished again.\n\n\u201c\u2018I open at the close . . .\u2019 What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\nHermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank.\n\n\u201cI open at the close . . . at the close . . . I open at the close . . .\u201d\n\nBut no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning from them.\n\n\u201cAnd the sword,\u201d said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch\u2019s inscription. \u201cWhy did he want Harry to have the sword?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why couldn\u2019t he just have told me?\u201d Harry said quietly. \u201cIt was there, it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn\u2019t he just give it to me then?\u201d\n\nHe felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand?\n\n\u201cAnd as for this book,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cThe Tales of Beedle the Bard . . . I\u2019ve never even heard of them!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?\u201d said Ron incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d said Hermione in surprise. \u201cDo you know them, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course I do!\u201d\n\nHarry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise.\n\n\u201cOh come on! All the old kids\u2019 stories are supposed to be Beedle\u2019s, aren\u2019t they? \u2018The Fountain of Fair Fortune\u2019 . . . \u2018The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\u2019 . . . \u2018Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d said Hermione, giggling. \u201cWhat was that last one?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome off it!\u201d said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione. \u201cYou must\u2019ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard \u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u2019 and \u2018Cinderella\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, an illness?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cSo these are children\u2019s stories?\u201d asked Hermione, bending again over the runes.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron uncertainly, \u201cI mean, that\u2019s just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they\u2019re like in the original versions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?\u201d\n\nSomething creaked downstairs.\n\n\u201cProbably just Charlie, now Mum\u2019s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair,\u201d said Ron nervously.\n\n\u201cAll the same, we should get to bed,\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t do to oversleep tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d agreed Ron. \u201cA brutal triple murder by the bridegroom\u2019s mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding. I\u2019ll get the lights.\u201d\n\nAnd he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter8": "THE WEDDING\n\n\n\n\nThree o\u2019clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred, and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as \u201cCousin Barny\u201d and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him.\n\nAll four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden-jacketed band, and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree; Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot.\n\nBehind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer\u2019s day.\n\n\u201cWhen I get married,\u201d said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, \u201cI won\u2019t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I\u2019ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it\u2019s all over.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t too bad this morning, considering,\u201d said George. \u201cCried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves \u2014 here they come, look.\u201d\n\nBrightly colored figures were appearing, one by one, out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches\u2019 hats, while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards\u2019 cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent.\n\n\u201cExcellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,\u201d said George, craning his neck for a better look. \u201cThey\u2019ll need help understanding our English customs, I\u2019ll look after them. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so fast, Your Holeyness,\u201d said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the procession, he said, \u201cHere \u2014 permettez-moi to assister vous,\u201d to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley\u2019s old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry\u2019s lot.\n\n\u201cWotcher,\u201d said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. \u201cArthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,\u201d she added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. \u201cThe Ministry\u2019s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I understand,\u201d said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away, Harry saw Lupin\u2019s face fall again into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred\u2019s directions he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks.\n\nWhile Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck.\n\n\u201cXenophilius Lovegood,\u201d he said, extending a hand to Harry, \u201cmy daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?\u201d he added to Ron.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIsn\u2019t she with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes \u2014 or, to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.\u201d\n\n\u201cOurs do know a lot of excellent swear words,\u201d said Ron, \u201cbut I think Fred and George taught them those.\u201d\n\nHe led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up.\n\n\u201cHello, Harry!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 my name\u2019s Barny,\u201d said Harry, flummoxed.\n\n\u201cOh, have you changed that too?\u201d she asked brightly.\n\n\u201cHow did you know \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, just your expression,\u201d she said.\n\nLike her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you got over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears.\n\nXenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Bidding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, \u201cDaddy, look \u2014 one of the gnomes actually bit me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!\u201d said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna\u2019s outstretched finger and examining the bleeding puncture marks. \u201cLuna, my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today \u2014 perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in Mermish \u2014 do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!\u201d\n\nRon, passing them in the opposite direction, let out a loud snort.\n\n\u201cRon can laugh,\u201d said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, \u201cbut my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father\u2019s peculiar views. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to put anything on that bite, though?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine,\u201d said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down. \u201cYou look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.\u201d\n\nAs she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm. Her beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and feathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo.\n\n\u201c. . . and your hair\u2019s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin\u2019s beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?\u201d she barked at Harry.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn\u2019t Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 he couldn\u2019t come \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I\u2019ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,\u201d she shouted at Harry. \u201cGoblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. She\u2019s a good-looking girl, but still \u2014 French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.\u201d\n\nRon gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The marquee was nearly full now, and for the first time there was no queue outside.\n\n\u201cNightmare, Muriel is,\u201d said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. \u201cShe used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she\u2019ll have written them out of her will \u2014 like they care, they\u2019re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they\u2019re going. . . . Wow,\u201d he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. \u201cYou look great!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways the tone of surprise,\u201d said Hermione, though she smiled. She was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. \u201cYour Great-Aunt Muriel doesn\u2019t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said, \u2018Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?\u2019 and then, \u2018Bad posture and skinny ankles.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take it personally, she\u2019s rude to everyone,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cTalking about Muriel?\u201d inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,\u201d conceded George.\n\n\u201cBut before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,\u201d said Fred. \u201cHe used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he sounds a real charmer,\u201d said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter.\n\n\u201cNever married, for some reason,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYou amaze me,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThey were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, \u201cYou look vunderful.\u201d\n\n\u201cViktor!\u201d she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were \u2014 goodness \u2014 it\u2019s lovely to see \u2014 how are you?\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum\u2019s invitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, \u201cHow come you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\n\u201cFleur invited me,\u201d said Krum, eyebrows raised.\n\nHarry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then, feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron\u2019s vicinity, offered to show him his seat.\n\n\u201cYour friend is not pleased to see me,\u201d said Krum as they entered the now packed marquee. \u201cOr is he a relative?\u201d he added with a glance at Harry\u2019s red curly hair.\n\n\u201cCousin,\u201d Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle.\n\n\u201cTime to sit down,\u201d Fred told Harry, \u201cor we\u2019re going to get run over by the bride.\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron\u2019s ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to Harry, \u201cDid you see he\u2019s grown a stupid little beard?\u201d\n\nHarry gave a noncommittal grunt.\n\nA sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst-colored robes with a matching hat.\n\nA moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, with large white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons.\n\n\u201cOoooh!\u201d said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance.\n\nA great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, now standing in front of Bill and Fleur. \u201cWe are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,\u201d said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. \u201cBut I must say, Ginevra\u2019s dress is far too low cut.\u201d\n\nGinny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry\u2019s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person\u2019s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. . . .\n\n\u201cDo you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle . . . ?\u201d\n\nIn the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears.\n\n\u201c. . . then I declare you bonded for life.\u201d\n\nThe tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst: Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen!\u201d called the tufty-haired wizard. \u201cIf you would please stand up!\u201d\n\nThey all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The seats on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back to earth around it, and the golden-jacketed band trooped toward a podium.\n\n\u201cSmooth,\u201d said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches.\n\n\u201cWe should go and congratulate them!\u201d said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have time later,\u201d shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. \u201cHermione, cop hold, let\u2019s grab a table. . . . Not there! Nowhere near Muriel \u2014\u201d\n\nRon led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went: Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.\n\n\u201cAll right if we join you?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said happily. \u201cDaddy\u2019s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, a lifetime\u2019s supply of Gurdyroots?\u201d asked Ron.\n\nHermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments.\n\nThe band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cI like this song,\u201d said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s great, isn\u2019t she?\u201d said Ron admiringly. \u201cAlways good value.\u201d\n\nBut the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna\u2019s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, \u201cWho is that man in the yellow?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Xenophilius Lovegood, he\u2019s the father of a friend of ours,\u201d said Ron. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. \u201cCome and dance,\u201d he added abruptly to Hermione.\n\nShe looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor.\n\n\u201cAh, they are together now?\u201d asked Krum, momentarily distracted.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 sort of,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Krum asked.\n\n\u201cBarny Weasley.\u201d\n\nThey shook hands.\n\n\u201cYou, Barny \u2014 you know this man Lovegood vell?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I only met him today. Why?\u201d\n\nKrum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said Krum, \u201cif he vos not a guest of Fleur\u2019s, I vould duel him, here and now, for vearing that filthy sign upon his chest.\u201d\n\n\u201cSign?\u201d said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cGrindelvald. That is Grindelvald\u2019s sign.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrindelwald . . . the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d\n\nKrum\u2019s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, \u201cGrindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never poverful in this country, they said he feared Dumbledore \u2014 and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this\u201d \u2014 he pointed a finger at Xenophilius \u2014 \u201cthis is his symbol, I recognized it at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ven he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes, thinking to shock, make themselves impressive \u2014 until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.\u201d\n\nKrum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna\u2019s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape.\n\n\u201cAre you \u2014 er \u2014 quite sure it\u2019s Grindelwald\u2019s \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not mistaken,\u201d said Krum coldly. \u201cI valked past that sign for several years, I know it vell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a chance,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat Xenophilius doesn\u2019t actually know what the symbol means. The Lovegoods are quite . . . unusual. He could easily have picked it up somewhere and think it\u2019s a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cross section of a vot?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges.\n\n\u201cVy is she doing that?\u201d asked Krum.\n\n\u201cProbably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,\u201d said Harry, who recognized the symptoms.\n\nKrum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it menacingly on his thigh; sparks flew out of the end.\n\n\u201cGregorovitch!\u201d said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum\u2019s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament.\n\n\u201cVot about him?\u201d asked Krum suspiciously.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a wandmaker!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that,\u201d said Krum.\n\n\u201cHe made your wand! That\u2019s why I thought \u2014 Quidditch \u2014\u201d\n\nKrum was looking more and more suspicious.\n\n\u201cHow do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . I read it somewhere, I think,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIn a \u2014 a fan magazine,\u201d he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified.\n\n\u201cI had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo . . . er . . . where is Gregorovitch these days?\u201d\n\nKrum looked puzzled.\n\n\u201cHe retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand. They are the best \u2014 although I know, of course, that you Britons set much store by Ollivander.\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a reason: It was surely because of what Harry\u2019s wand had done on the night that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, something that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorovitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not?\n\n\u201cThis girl is very nice-looking,\u201d Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. \u201cShe is also a relative of yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, suddenly irritated, \u201cand she\u2019s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn\u2019t want to cross him.\u201d\n\nKrum grunted.\n\n\u201cVot,\u201d he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, \u201cis the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?\u201d\n\nAnd he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but Ron was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George\u2019s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron.\n\nHe had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur\u2019s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing \u201cOdo the Hero\u201d in a corner.\n\nWandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron\u2019s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore\u2019s obituary.\n\nHarry approached him.\n\n\u201cMay I sit down?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice.\n\nHarry leaned in.\n\n\u201cMr. Doge, I\u2019m Harry Potter.\u201d\n\nDoge gasped.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. . . . I am so glad, so honored!\u201d\n\nIn a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne.\n\n\u201cI thought of writing to you,\u201d he whispered, \u201cafter Dumbledore . . . the shock . . . and for you, I am sure . . .\u201d\n\nDoge\u2019s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears.\n\n\u201cI saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs well as anyone,\u201d said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. \u201cCertainly I knew him longest, if you don\u2019t count Aberforth \u2014 and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of the Daily Prophet . . . I don\u2019t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cElphias, I don\u2019t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?\u201d\n\nDoge\u2019s face flooded with angry color.\n\n\u201cOh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her. I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, in that interview,\u201d Harry went on, \u201cRita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe a word of it!\u201d said Doge at once. \u201cNot a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!\u201d\n\nHarry looked into Doge\u2019s earnest, pained face and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn\u2019t Doge understand Harry\u2019s need to be sure, to know everything?\n\nPerhaps Doge suspected Harry\u2019s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, \u201cHarry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful \u2014\u201d\n\nBut he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.\n\n\u201cRita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!\u201d\n\nHarry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hat, a goblet of champagne in her hand. \u201cShe\u2019s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, Muriel,\u201d said Doge. \u201cYes, we were just discussing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou there! Give me your chair, I\u2019m a hundred and seven!\u201d\n\nAnother redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and Harry.\n\n\u201cHello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,\u201d she said to Harry. \u201cNow, what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know she\u2019s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can\u2019t wait to read it, I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!\u201d\n\nDoge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. She took another large gulp of champagne, belched, and then said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!\u201d\n\n\u201cIll-informed sniping,\u201d said Doge, turning radish-colored again.\n\n\u201cYou would say that, Elphias,\u201d cackled Auntie Muriel. \u201cI noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you think so,\u201d said Doge, more coldly still. \u201cI assure you I was writing from the heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you\u2019ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!\u201d\n\n\u201cMuriel!\u201d exclaimed Doge.\n\nA chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked Muriel. \u201cWho said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was ill?\u201d\n\n\u201cThought wrong, then, didn\u2019t you, Barry!\u201d said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect she had produced. \u201cAnyway, how could you expect to know anything about it? It all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t wait to find out what Skeeter\u2019s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!\u201d\n\n\u201cUntrue!\u201d wheezed Doge. \u201cAbsolutely untrue!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never told me his sister was a Squib,\u201d said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside.\n\n\u201cAnd why on earth would he tell you?\u201d screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry.\n\n\u201cThe reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,\u201d began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, \u201cis, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did nobody ever see her, Elphias?\u201d squawked Muriel. \u201cWhy did half of us never even know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his own house!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, locked in the cellar?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\nDoge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry.\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,\u201d whispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him.\n\n\u201c\u2014 proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a Squib \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAriana was not a Squib!\u201d wheezed Doge.\n\n\u201cSo you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!\u201d said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. \u201cIn our day, Squibs were often hushed up, though to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn\u2019t exist \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you, that\u2019s not what happened!\u201d said Doge, but Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still addressing Harry.\n\n\u201cSquibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community . . . much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class; but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAriana was delicate!\u201d said Doge desperately. \u201cHer health was always too poor to permit her \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 to permit her to leave the house?\u201d cackled Muriel. \u201cAnd yet she was never taken to St. Mungo\u2019s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, Muriel, how you can possibly know whether \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo\u2019s at the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!\u201d\n\nDoge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore\u2019s sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts, to prove himself brilliant and talented?\n\n\u201cNow, if Kendra hadn\u2019t died first,\u201d Muriel resumed, \u201cI\u2019d have said that it was she who finished off Ariana \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you, Muriel?\u201d groaned Doge. \u201cA mother kill her own daughter? Think what you are saying!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not?\u201d shrugged Auntie Muriel. \u201cBut as I say, it doesn\u2019t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana \u2014 of what, nobody ever seemed sure \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no doubt Ariana murdered her,\u201d said Doge with a brave attempt at scorn. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,\u201d said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. \u201cShake your head all you like, Elphias! You were at Ariana\u2019s funeral, were you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I was,\u201d said Doge, through trembling lips. \u201cAnd a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHis heart wasn\u2019t the only thing. Didn\u2019t Aberforth break Albus\u2019s nose halfway through the service?\u201d\n\nIf Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin.\n\n\u201cHow do you \u2014 ?\u201d croaked Doge.\n\n\u201cMy mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,\u201d said Auntie Muriel happily. \u201cBathilda described the whole thing to Mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus\u2019s fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that\u2019s odd enough in itself, Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back.\u201d\n\nMuriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of these old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe: He wanted the truth, and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you something else,\u201d Muriel said, hiccuping slightly as she lowered her goblet. \u201cI think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter\u2019s interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores \u2014 goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!\u201d\n\n\u201cBathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!\u201d whispered Doge.\n\n\u201cBathilda Bagshot?\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe author of A History of Magic?\u201d\n\nThe name was printed on the front of one of Harry\u2019s textbooks, though admittedly not one of the ones he had read most attentively.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Doge, clutching at Harry\u2019s question like a drowning man at a life belt. \u201cA most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite gaga these days, I\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Auntie Muriel cheerfully.\n\n\u201cIf that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,\u201d said Doge, \u201cand no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I\u2019m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,\u201d said Auntie Muriel. \u201cBut even if Bathilda\u2019s completely cuckoo, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. . . . Well worth a trip to Godric\u2019s Hollow, I\u2019d have thought.\u201d\n\nHarry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he asked, \u201cBathilda Bagshot lives in Godric\u2019s Hollow?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, she\u2019s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dumbledores lived in Godric\u2019s Hollow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Barry, that\u2019s what I just said,\u201d said Auntie Muriel testily.\n\nHarry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric\u2019s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to Dumbledore\u2019s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily\u2019s and James\u2019s to do so? And he had never once told Harry . . . never bothered to say . . .\n\nAnd why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. He stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him.\n\n\u201cI simply can\u2019t dance anymore,\u201d she panted, slipping off one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. \u201cRon\u2019s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It\u2019s a bit odd, I\u2019ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna\u2019s father, it looked like they\u2019d been arguing \u2014\u201d She dropped her voice, staring at him. \u201cHarry, are you okay?\u201d\n\nHarry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter. At that moment, something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronus\u2019s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.\u201d"}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter9": "A PLACE TO HIDE\n\n\n\n\nEverything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and Hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands. Many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened; heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. Silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed. Then somebody screamed.\n\nHarry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating; the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken.\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d Hermione cried. \u201cRon, where are you?\u201d\n\nAs they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them shout, \u201cProtego!\u201d, a cry that was echoed on all sides \u2014\n\n\u201cRon! Ron!\u201d Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffeted by terrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren\u2019t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know \u2014\n\nAnd then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione\u2019s free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was Hermione\u2019s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself. . . .\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice.\n\nHarry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all: They still seemed to be surrounded by people.\n\n\u201cTottenham Court Road,\u201d panted Hermione. \u201cWalk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for you to change.\u201d\n\nHarry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street thronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still wearing dress robes.\n\n\u201cHermione, we haven\u2019t got anything to change into,\u201d Ron told her, as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?\u201d said Harry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. \u201cAll last year I kept it on me and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ve got the Cloak, I\u2019ve got clothes for both of you,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cJust try and act naturally until \u2014 this will do.\u201d\n\nShe led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway.\n\n\u201cWhen you say you\u2019ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . .\u201d said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging.\n\n\u201cYes, they\u2019re here,\u201d said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron\u2019s utter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.\n\n\u201cHow the ruddy hell \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cUndetectable Extension Charm,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cTricky, but I think I\u2019ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.\u201d She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. \u201cOh, damn, that\u2019ll be the books,\u201d she said, peering into it, \u201cand I had them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . . Harry, you\u2019d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did you do all this?\u201d Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes.\n\n\u201cI told you at the Burrow, I\u2019ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, you are,\u201d said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag. \u201cPlease, Harry, get that Cloak on!\u201d\n\nHarry threw the Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened.\n\n\u201cThe others \u2014 everyone at the wedding \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t worry about that now,\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s you they\u2019re after, Harry, and we\u2019ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even if he could not see his face. \u201cMost of the Order was there, they\u2019ll look after everyone.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, \u201cYeah.\u201d But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.\n\n\u201cCome on, I think we ought to keep moving,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThey moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement.\n\n\u201cJust as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?\u201d Ron asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re safer out in the Muggle world, it\u2019s not where they\u2019ll expect us to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Ron, looking around, \u201cbut don\u2019t you feel a bit \u2014 exposed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere else is there?\u201d asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started wolf-whistling at her. \u201cWe can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try my parents\u2019 house, though I think there\u2019s a chance they might check there. . . . Oh, I wish they\u2019d shut up!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, darling?\u201d the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. \u201cFancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit down somewhere,\u201d Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road. \u201cLook, this will do, in here!\u201d\n\nIt was a small and shabby all-night caf\u00e9. A light layer of grease lay on all the Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again.\n\nAfter a minute or two, Ron said, \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it\u2019s only in Charing Cross \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, we can\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione at once.\n\n\u201cNot to stay there, but to find out what\u2019s going on!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know what\u2019s going on! Voldemort\u2019s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, it was just an idea!\u201d\n\nThey relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the caf\u00e9 and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper.\n\n\u201cI say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once we\u2019re there, we could send a message to the Order.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you do that talking Patronus thing, then?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been practicing and I think so,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, as long as it doesn\u2019t get them into trouble, though they might\u2019ve been arrested already. God, that\u2019s revolting,\u201d Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers\u2019 orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get going, then, I don\u2019t want to drink this muck,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I\u2019ll bet all the change is at the bottom,\u201d sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag.\n\nThe two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. The force of the Death Eaters\u2019 spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron\u2019s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, \u201cStupefy!\u201d\n\nThe great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: He slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot \u2014 the waitress screamed and ran for the door \u2014 Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.\n\n\u201cExpulso!\u201d bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over.\n\n\u201cD-diffindo,\u201d she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, Ron, my hand\u2019s shaking! Diffindo!\u201d\n\nThe severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled across the bench.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,\u201d he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man\u2019s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Dolohov,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one\u2019s Thorfinn Rowle.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind what they\u2019re called!\u201d said Hermione a little hysterically. \u201cHow did they find us? What are we going to do?\u201d\n\nSomehow her panic seemed to clear Harry\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cLock the door,\u201d he told her, \u201cand Ron, turn out the lights.\u201d\n\nHe looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the caf\u00e9 into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with them?\u201d Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even more quietly, \u201cKill them? They\u2019d kill us. They had a good go just now.\u201d\n\nHermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head.\n\n\u201cWe just need to wipe their memories,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s better like that, it\u2019ll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it\u2019d be obvious we were here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the boss,\u201d said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never done a Memory Charm.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor have I,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cbut I know the theory.\u201d\n\nShe took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov\u2019s forehead and said, \u201cObliviate.\u201d\n\nAt once, Dolohov\u2019s eyes became unfocused and dreamy.\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d said Harry, clapping her on the back. \u201cTake care of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.\u201d\n\n\u201cClear up?\u201d said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed caf\u00e9. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think they might wonder what\u2019s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it\u2019s just been bombed?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh right, yeah . . .\u201d\n\nRon struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder I can\u2019t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they\u2019re tight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead.\n\nOnce the caf\u00e9 was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other.\n\n\u201cBut how did they find us?\u201d Hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. \u201cHow did they know where we were?\u201d\n\nShe turned to Harry.\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 you don\u2019t think you\u2019ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t have,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe Trace breaks at seventeen, that\u2019s Wizarding law, you can\u2019t put it on an adult.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as you know,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWhat if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry hasn\u2019t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who\u2019s supposed to have put a Trace back on him?\u201d\n\nHermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was that really how the Death Eaters had found them?\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t use magic, and you can\u2019t use magic near me, without us giving away our position \u2014\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not splitting up!\u201d said Hermione firmly.\n\n\u201cWe need a safe place to hide,\u201d said Ron. \u201cGive us time to think things through.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrimmauld Place,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe other two gaped.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!\u201d\n\n\u201cRon\u2019s dad said they\u2019ve put up jinxes against him \u2014 and even if they haven\u2019t worked,\u201d he pressed on as Hermione began to argue, \u201cso what? I swear, I\u2019d like nothing better than to meet Snape!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, where else is there? It\u2019s the best chance we\u2019ve got. Snape\u2019s only one Death Eater. If I\u2019ve still got the Trace on me, we\u2019ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.\u201d\n\nShe could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she unlocked the caf\u00e9 door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the caf\u00e9\u2019s light. Then, on Harry\u2019s count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more.\n\nSeconds later Harry\u2019s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold.\n\nAs Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius\u2019s mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll\u2019s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over again.\n\n\u201cI think somebody\u2019s been in here,\u201d Hermione whispered, pointing toward it.\n\n\u201cThat could\u2019ve happened as the Order left,\u201d Ron murmured back.\n\n\u201cSo where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re only activated if he shows up?\u201d suggested Ron.\n\nYet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move farther into the house.\n\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t stay here forever,\u201d said Harry, and he took a step forward.\n\n\u201cSeverus Snape?\u201d\n\nMad-Eye Moody\u2019s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in fright. \u201cWe\u2019re not Snape!\u201d croaked Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again.\n\nThe other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered, \u201cThat m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set up for Snape!\u201d\n\nGingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-colored, and terrible: Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. \u201cNo! It wasn\u2019t us! We didn\u2019t kill you \u2014\u201d\n\nOn the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust: Coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s all r-right. . . . It\u2019s g-gone. . . .\u201d\n\nDust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black continued to scream.\n\n\u201cMudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her.\n\n\u201cThat . . . that was . . . .\u201d Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t really him, was it? Just something to scare Snape.\u201d\n\nHad it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board.\n\n\u201cBefore we go any farther, I think we\u2019d better check,\u201d whispered Hermione, and she raised her wand and said, \u201cHomenum revelio.\u201d\n\nNothing happened.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve just had a big shock,\u201d said Ron kindly. \u201cWhat was that supposed to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did what I meant it to do!\u201d said Hermione rather crossly. \u201cThat was a spell to reveal human presence, and there\u2019s nobody here except us!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd old Dusty,\u201d said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had risen.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go up,\u201d said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor.\n\nHermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtain aside an inch.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t see anyone out there,\u201d he reported. \u201cAnd you\u2019d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, they\u2019d have followed us here. I know they can\u2019t get in the house, but \u2014 what\u2019s up, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned again as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock.\n\n\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Ron asked, advancing on Harry. \u201cDid you see him at my place?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I just felt anger \u2014 he\u2019s really angry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that could be at the Burrow,\u201d said Ron loudly. \u201cWhat else? Didn\u2019t you see anything? Was he cursing someone?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I just felt anger \u2014 I couldn\u2019t tell \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, \u201cYour scar, again? But what\u2019s going on? I thought that connection had closed!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did, for a while,\u201d muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard to concentrate. \u201cI \u2014 I think it\u2019s started opening again whenever he loses control, that\u2019s how it used to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then you\u2019ve got to close your mind!\u201d said Hermione shrilly. \u201cHarry, Dumbledore didn\u2019t want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that\u2019s why you were supposed to use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I do remember, thanks,\u201d said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius\u2019s death. He wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick.\n\nHe turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cFamily safe, do not reply, we are being watched.\u201d\n\nThe Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione joined him, gripping his arm.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all right, they\u2019re all right!\u201d she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he said over Hermione\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. \u201cIt\u2019s your family, \u2019course you\u2019re worried. I\u2019d feel the same way.\u201d He thought of Ginny. \u201cI do feel the same way.\u201d\n\nThe pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I\u2019ve brought and camp in here tonight?\u201d\n\nHe heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer: He had to succumb.\n\n\u201cBathroom,\u201d he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running.\n\nHe barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the great blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice.\n\n\u201cMore, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure . . . Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!\u201d\n\nA log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face \u2014 with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes.\n\nHe was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy\u2019s gaunt, petrified face seemed branded on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort.\n\nThere was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione\u2019s voice rang out.\n\n\u201cHarry, do you want your toothbrush? I\u2019ve got it here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, great, thanks,\u201d he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter10": "KREACHER\u2019S TALE\n\n\n\n\nHarry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room floor. A chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains: It was the cool, clear blue of watered ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet except for Ron and Hermione\u2019s slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his. Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron\u2019s. Harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely.\n\nHe looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than twenty-four hours ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen now? He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting, complex mission Dumbledore had left him . . . Dumbledore . . .\n\nThe grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore\u2019s death felt different now. The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things, infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden?\n\nHarry thought of Godric\u2019s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledore\u2019s will, and resentment swelled in the darkness. Why hadn\u2019t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn\u2019t he explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in?\n\nHarry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bag, picked up his wand, and crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, \u201cLumos,\u201d and started to climb the stairs by wandlight.\n\nOn the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after Sirius died? Harry\u2019s gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius\u2019s great-great-grandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmaster\u2019s study at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing, where there were only two doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading SIRIUS. Harry had never entered his godfather\u2019s bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible. The room was spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains, and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle stubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging in frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed\u2019s headboard; a spider\u2019s web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as Harry moved deeper into the room, he heard a scurrying of disturbed mice.\n\nThe teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls\u2019 silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius\u2019s parents had been unable to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall, because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest son\u2019s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have gone out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and gold, just to underline his difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius\u2019s nerve) several posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in contrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls, which was a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera.\n\nWith a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father; his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like Harry\u2019s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius\u2019s right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. On James\u2019s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included . . . or was it simply because Harry knew how it had been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room.\n\nHarry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brighter: A shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius\u2019s bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with their covers, and sundry pages littered the floor.\n\nHarry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them. He recognized one as part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and crumpled. He smoothed it out.\n\nDear Padfoot,\n\nThank you thank you, for Harry\u2019s birthday present! It was his favorite by far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself, I\u2019m enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground, but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course, James thought it was so funny, says he\u2019s going to be a great Quidditch player, but we\u2019ve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don\u2019t take our eyes off him when he gets going.\n\nWe had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn\u2019t come, but the Order\u2019s got to come first, and Harry\u2019s not old enough to know it\u2019s his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell \u2014 also, Dumbledore\u2019s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here last weekend, I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; I cried all evening when I heard.\n\nBathilda drops in most days, she\u2019s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore, I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d be pleased if he knew! I don\u2019t know how much to believe, actually, because it seems incredible that Dumbledore\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still, holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering in equal measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he sat down.\n\nHe read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time, and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She had made her \u201cg\u201ds the same way he did: He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these letters, these words, words about him, Harry, her son.\n\nImpatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice.\n\nThey had had a cat . . . perhaps it had perished, like his parents, at Godric\u2019s Hollow . . . or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it. . . . Sirius had bought him his first broomstick. . . . His parents had known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced them? Dumbledore\u2019s still got his Invisibility Cloak . . . There was something funny there. . . .\n\nHarry paused, pondering his mother\u2019s words. Why had Dumbledore taken James\u2019s Invisibility Cloak? Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before, \u201cI don\u2019t need a cloak to become invisible.\u201d Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed its assistance, and Dumbledore had acted as carrier? Harry passed on. . . .\n\nWormy was here . . . Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed \u201cdown,\u201d had he? Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for the last time?\n\nAnd finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore \u2014\n\nThat Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance, or had taken up goat-charming like Aberforth. . . .\n\nHarry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. He seized papers, treating them, in his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher; he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair.\n\nAt last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph Lily had described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after him. Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily\u2019s letter and continued to look for the second sheet.\n\nAfter another quarter of an hour, however, he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mother\u2019s letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room? Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters. . . . The only potentially useful thing he could see here was possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore \u2014 what?\n\n\u201cHarry? Harry! Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d he called. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d\n\nThere was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside.\n\n\u201cWe woke up and didn\u2019t know where you were!\u201d she said breathlessly. She turned and shouted over her shoulder, \u201cRon! I\u2019ve found him!\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below.\n\n\u201cGood! Tell him from me he\u2019s a git!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, don\u2019t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you come up here anyway?\u201d She gazed around the ransacked room. \u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook what I\u2019ve just found.\u201d\n\nHe held out his mother\u2019s letter. Hermione took it and read it while Harry watched her. When she reached the end of the page she looked up at him.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s this too.\u201d\n\nHe handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for the rest of the letter,\u201d Harry said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not here.\u201d\n\nHermione glanced around.\n\n\u201cDid you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone had searched before me,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What were they after, do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cInformation on the Order, if it was Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019d think he\u2019d already have all he needed, I mean, he was in the Order, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then,\u201d said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, \u201cwhat about information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cBathilda Bagshot, the author of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA History of Magic,\u201d said Hermione, looking interested. \u201cSo your parents knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s still alive,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand she lives in Godric\u2019s Hollow, Ron\u2019s Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore\u2019s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nThere was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him for Harry\u2019s liking. He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so as not to have to look at her and give himself away.\n\n\u201cI understand why you\u2019d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and Dumbledore too,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?\u201d Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, \u201cHarry, I know you really want to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow, but I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be expecting you to visit it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that,\u201d Harry said, still avoiding looking at her. \u201cMuriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth. . . .\u201d\n\nHe told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had finished, Hermione said, \u201cOf course, I can see why that\u2019s upset you, Harry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not upset,\u201d he lied, \u201cI\u2019d just like to know whether or not it\u2019s true or \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, do you really think you\u2019ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I did,\u201d he muttered.\n\n\u201cBut you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?\u201d\n\nHe looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was again: Choose what to believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it?\n\n\u201cShall we go down to the kitchen?\u201d Hermione suggested after a little pause. \u201cFind something for breakfast?\u201d\n\nHe agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past the second door that led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not noticed in the dark. He paused at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a pompous little sign, neatly lettered by hand, the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door:\n\nDo Not Enter\n\nWithout the Express Permission of Regulus Arcturus Black\n\n\n\nExcitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why. He read the sign again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him.\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. \u201cCome back up here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cR.A.B. I think I\u2019ve found him.\u201d\n\nThere was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs.\n\n\u201cIn your mum\u2019s letter? But I didn\u2019t see \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head, pointing at Regulus\u2019s sign. She read it, then clutched Harry\u2019s arm so tightly that he winced.\n\n\u201cSirius\u2019s brother?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cHe was a Death Eater,\u201d said Harry, \u201cSirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave \u2014 so they killed him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat fits!\u201d gasped Hermione. \u201cIf he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!\u201d\n\nShe released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, \u201cRon! RON! Get up here, quick!\u201d\n\nRon appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his hand.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up? If it\u2019s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I \u2014\u201d\n\nHe frowned at the sign on Regulus\u2019s door, to which Hermione was silently pointing.\n\n\u201cWhat? That was Sirius\u2019s brother, wasn\u2019t it? Regulus Arcturus . . . Regulus . . . R.A.B.! The locket \u2014 you don\u2019t reckon \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d said Harry. He pushed the door: It was locked. Hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said, \u201cAlohomora.\u201d There was a click, and the door swung open.\n\nThey moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus\u2019s bedroom was slightly smaller than Sirius\u2019s, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise his difference from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its motto, TOUJOURS PUR. Beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged collage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all about Voldemort,\u201d she said. \u201cRegulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters. . . .\u201d\n\nA little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photograph; a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row: He had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been.\n\n\u201cHe played Seeker,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort\u2019s press clippings.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sitting in the middle of the front row, that\u2019s where the Seeker . . . Never mind,\u201d said Harry, realizing that nobody was listening: Ron was on his hands and knees, searching under the wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched before them. The drawers\u2019 contents had been turned over recently, the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills, out-of-date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an easier way,\u201d said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans. She raised her wand and said, \u201cAccio Locket!\u201d\n\nNothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, looked disappointed.\n\n\u201cIs that it, then? It\u2019s not here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cCharms to prevent it being summoned magically, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,\u201d said Harry, remembering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket.\n\n\u201cHow are we supposed to find it then?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cWe search manually,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his examination of the curtains.\n\nThey combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, finally, to conclude that the locket was not there.\n\nThe sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows.\n\n\u201cIt could be somewhere else in the house, though,\u201d said Hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs: As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have become more determined. \u201cWhether he\u2019d managed to destroy it or not, he\u2019d want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn\u2019t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket\u2019s hiding place, even though we didn\u2019t realize it at . . . at . . .\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair, with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been Obliviated; her eyes had even drifted out of focus.\n\n\u201c. . . at the time,\u201d she finished in a whisper.\n\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cThere was a locket.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry and Ron together.\n\n\u201cIn the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we . . . we . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach. He remembered: He had even handled the thing as they passed it around, each trying in turn to prise it open. It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy. . . .\n\n\u201cKreacher nicked loads of things back from us,\u201d said Harry. It was the only chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go. \u201cHe had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nHe ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in his wake. They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius\u2019s mother as they passed through the hall.\n\n\u201cFilth! Mudbloods! Scum!\u201d she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them.\n\nHarry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at the door of Kreacher\u2019s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the house-elf had once slept, but they were no longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature\u2019s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; Hermione closed her eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, \u201cKreacher!\u201d\n\nThere was a loud crack and the house-elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, his pale skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears. He was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon Harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit.\n\n\u201cMaster,\u201d croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog\u2019s voice, and he bowed low, muttering to his knees, \u201cback in my Mistress\u2019s old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI forbid you to call anyone \u2018blood traitor\u2019 or \u2018Mudblood,\u2019\u201d growled Harry. He would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctly unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a question for you,\u201d said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf, \u201cand I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Master,\u201d said Kreacher, bowing low again: Harry saw his lips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago,\u201d said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs, \u201cthere was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?\u201d\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the face. Then he said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is it now?\u201d asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful.\n\nKreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word.\n\n\u201cGone.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone?\u201d echoed Harry, elation flooding out of him. \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s gone?\u201d\n\nThe elf shivered. He swayed.\n\n\u201cKreacher,\u201d said Harry fiercely, \u201cI order you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMundungus Fletcher,\u201d croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. \u201cMundungus Fletcher stole it all: Miss Bella\u2019s and Miss Cissy\u2019s pictures, my Mistress\u2019s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the goblets with the family crest, and \u2014 and \u2014\u201d\n\nKreacher was gulping for air: His hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream.\n\n\u201c \u2014 and the locket, Master Regulus\u2019s locket, Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!\u201d\n\nHarry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, he launched himself upon the elf, flattening him. Hermione\u2019s scream mingled with Kreacher\u2019s, but Harry bellowed louder than both of them: \u201cKreacher, I order you to stay still!\u201d\n\nHe felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes.\n\n\u201cHarry, let him up!\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\n\u201cSo he can beat himself up with the poker?\u201d snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Right, Kreacher, I want the truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher saw him!\u201d gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth. \u201cKreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher\u2019s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher\u2019s treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r-ran. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou called the locket \u2018Master Regulus\u2019s,\u2019\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy? Where did it come from? What did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!\u201d\n\nThe elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began to rock backward and forward. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, echoing kitchen.\n\n\u201cMaster Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and broke my Mistress\u2019s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper pride; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns . . . and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so happy to serve . . .\n\n\u201cAnd one day, a year after he had joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said . . . he said . . .\n\nThe old elf rocked faster than ever.\n\n\u201c. . . he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort needed an elf?\u201d Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d moaned Kreacher. \u201cAnd Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do . . . and then to c-come home.\u201d\n\nKreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs.\n\n\u201cSo Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in the cavern was a great black lake . . .\u201d\n\nThe hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck stood up. Kreacher\u2019s croaking voice seemed to come to him from across that dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present.\n\n\u201c. . . There was a boat . . .\u201d\n\nOf course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux: by borrowing a disposable creature, a house-elf . . .\n\n\u201cThere was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it. . . .\u201d\n\nThe elf quaked from head to foot.\n\n\u201cKreacher drank, and as he drank, he saw terrible things . . . . Kreacher\u2019s insides burned . . . Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only laughed . . . He made Kreacher drink all the potion . . . He dropped a locket into the empty basin. . . . He filled it with more potion.\n\n\u201cAnd then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort\u2019s white, snakelike face vanishing into darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning potion caused its victim. . . . But here, Harry\u2019s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped.\n\n\u201cKreacher needed water, he crawled to the island\u2019s edge and he drank from the black lake . . . and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get away?\u201d Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering.\n\nKreacher raised his ugly head and looked at Harry with his great, bloodshot eyes.\n\n\u201cMaster Regulus told Kreacher to come back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know \u2014 but how did you escape the Inferi?\u201d\n\nKreacher did not seem to understand.\n\n\u201cMaster Regulus told Kreacher to come back,\u201d he repeated.\n\n\u201cI know, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it, Harry?\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe Disapparated!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut . . . you couldn\u2019t Apparate in and out of that cave,\u201d said Harry, \u201cotherwise Dumbledore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cElf magic isn\u2019t like wizard\u2019s magic, is it?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI mean, they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThere was silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy.\n\n\u201cOf course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice, just like all the purebloods who treat them like animals . . . It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe house-elf\u2019s highest law is his Master\u2019s bidding,\u201d intoned Kreacher. \u201cKreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, you did what you were told, didn\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione kindly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t disobey orders at all!\u201d\n\nKreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever.\n\n\u201cSo what happened when you got back?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cWhat did Regulus say when you told him what had happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster Regulus was very worried, very worried,\u201d croaked Kreacher. \u201cMaster Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then . . . it was a little while later . . . Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Master Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell . . . and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius. . . . Kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat; this time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison. . . .\n\n\u201cAnd he made you drink the potion?\u201d said Harry, disgusted.\n\nBut Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione\u2019s hands leapt to her mouth: She seemed to have understood something.\n\n\u201cM-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had,\u201d said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. \u201cAnd he told Kreacher to take it and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets. . . .\u201d\n\nKreacher\u2019s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to understand him.\n\n\u201cAnd he ordered \u2014 Kreacher to leave \u2014 without him. And he told Kreacher \u2014 to go home \u2014 and never to tell my Mistress \u2014 what he had done \u2014 but to destroy \u2014 the first locket. And he drank \u2014 all the potion \u2014 and Kreacher swapped the lockets \u2014 and watched . . . as Master Regulus . . . was dragged beneath the water . . . and . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Kreacher!\u201d wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed.\n\n\u201cThe Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his Mistress say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you not to call her \u2018Mudblood\u2019!\u201d snarled Harry, but the elf was already punishing himself: He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor.\n\n\u201cStop him \u2014 stop him!\u201d Hermione cried. \u201cOh, don\u2019t you see now how sick it is, the way they\u2019ve got to obey?\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher \u2014 stop, stop!\u201d shouted Harry.\n\nThe elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his snout, a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so pitiful.\n\n\u201cSo you brought the locket home,\u201d he said relentlessly, for he was determined to know the full story. \u201cAnd you tried to destroy it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,\u201d moaned the elf. \u201cKreacher tried everything, everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work. . . . So many powerful spells upon the casing, Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open. . . . Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his Mistress was mad with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared, and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave. . . .\u201d\n\nKreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears flowed down Hermione\u2019s cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who was no fan of Kreacher\u2019s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head, trying to clear it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand you, Kreacher,\u201d he said finally. \u201cVoldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, Kreacher doesn\u2019t think like that,\u201d said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand. \u201cHe\u2019s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher wasn\u2019t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher? He\u2019s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you\u2019re going to say,\u201d she went on as Harry began to protest, \u201cthat Regulus changed his mind . . . but he doesn\u2019t seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus\u2019s family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to protect them all.\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it\u2019s no good looking like that, you know it\u2019s true. Kreacher had been alone for a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a bit of affection. I\u2019m sure \u2018Miss Cissy\u2019 and \u2018Miss Bella\u2019 were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know. I\u2019ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort did . . . and so did Sirius.\u201d\n\nHarry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he remembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius\u2019s death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human\u2019s. . . .\n\n\u201cKreacher,\u201d said Harry after a while, \u201cwhen you feel up to it, er . . . please sit up.\u201d\n\nIt was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into silence. Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child.\n\n\u201cKreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,\u201d said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval: She smiled encouragingly.\n\n\u201cKreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to find out where the locket \u2014 where Master Regulus\u2019s locket is. It\u2019s really important. We want to finish the work Master Regulus started, we want to \u2014 er \u2014 ensure that he didn\u2019t die in vain.\u201d\n\nKreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry.\n\n\u201cFind Mundungus Fletcher?\u201d he croaked.\n\n\u201cAnd bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDo you think you could do that for us?\u201d\n\nAs Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid\u2019s purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to Voldemort.\n\n\u201cKreacher, I\u2019d, er, like you to have this,\u201d he said, pressing the locket into the elf\u2019s hand. \u201cThis belonged to Regulus and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOverkill, mate,\u201d said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto the ground.\n\nIt took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione\u2019s direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter11": "THE BRIBE\n\n\n\n\nIf Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most, and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help.\n\nKreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see.\n\n\u201cDeath Eaters, for sure,\u201d said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room windows. \u201cReckon they know we\u2019re in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Hermione, though she looked frightened, \u201cor they\u2019d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you reckon he\u2019s been in here and had his tongue tied by Moody\u2019s curse?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cotherwise he\u2019d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn\u2019t he? But they\u2019re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do they \u2014 ?\u201d began Harry.\n\n\u201cWizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They\u2019ll know Sirius left you the place.\u201d\n\nThe presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley\u2019s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket: This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off.\n\n\u201cWill you stop it!\u201d she cried on the third evening of Kreacher\u2019s absence, as all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again.\n\n\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. \u201cI don\u2019t know I\u2019m doing it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, can\u2019t you find something useful to occupy yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, like reading kids\u2019 stories?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore left me this book, Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I\u2019m supposed to use it!\u201d\n\nUnable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.\n\nEvery nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody\u2019s voice asked, \u201cSeverus Snape?\u201d Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand.\n\n\u201cIt was not I who killed you, Albus,\u201d said a quiet voice.\n\nThe jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind.\n\nHarry pointed his wand into the middle of it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d\n\nHe had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream, \u201cMudbloods and filth dishonoring my house \u2014\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below.\n\n\u201cHold your fire, it\u2019s me, Remus!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, thank goodness,\u201d said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did not.\n\n\u201cShow yourself!\u201d he called back.\n\nLupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender.\n\n\u201cI am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder\u2019s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all right,\u201d said Harry, lowering his wand, \u201cbut I had to check, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn\u2019t be quite so quick to lower your defenses.\u201d\n\nThey ran down the stairs toward him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them.\n\n\u201cNo sign of Severus, then?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is everyone okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cbut we\u2019re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can\u2019t know you\u2019re in here or I\u2019m sure they\u2019d have more people out there; they\u2019re staking out everywhere that\u2019s got any connection with you, Harry. Let\u2019s go downstairs, there\u2019s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.\u201d\n\nThey descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cSo, you came straight here after the wedding?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201conly after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a caf\u00e9 on Tottenham Court Road.\u201d\n\nLupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nThey explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast.\n\n\u201cBut how did they find you so quickly? It\u2019s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWe wondered,\u201d said Hermione tentatively, \u201cwhether Harry could still have the Trace on him?\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. \u201cApart from anything else, they\u2019d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn\u2019t they? But I can\u2019t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that\u2019s worrying, really worrying.\u201d\n\nHe looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait.\n\n\u201cTell us what happened after we left, we haven\u2019t heard a thing since Ron\u2019s dad told us the family were safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Kingsley saved us,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere they Death Eaters or Ministry people?\u201d interjected Hermione.\n\n\u201cA mixture; but to all intents and purposes they\u2019re the same thing now,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThere were about a dozen of them, but they didn\u2019t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it\u2019s true, he didn\u2019t give you away.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man\u2019s final act had been to try to protect Harry.\n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,\u201d Lupin went on. \u201cThey found the ghoul, but didn\u2019t want to get too close \u2014 and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.\n\n\u201cAt the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,\u201d he added quickly, forestalling the question, \u201cbut they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle\u2019s house, but as you know he wasn\u2019t there, and they used the Cruciatus Curse on Tonks\u2019s family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. They\u2019re all right \u2014 shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?\u201d Harry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks\u2019s parents\u2019 garden.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we\u2019d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they\u2019d come.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry\u2019s whereabouts out of people?\u201d asked Hermione, an edge to her voice.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, \u201cyou\u2019ll know sooner or later anyway. That\u2019s their pretext for going after you.\u201d\n\nHarry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read the headline over it:\n\nWANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\n\n\nRon and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any more: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry,\u201d Lupin said.\n\n\u201cSo Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?\u201d asked Hermione furiously.\n\nLupin nodded.\n\n\u201cBut surely people realize what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe coup has been smooth and virtually silent,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThe official version of Scrimgeour\u2019s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?\u201d asked Ron.\n\nLupin laughed.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to, Ron. Effectively he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry.\n\n\u201cNaturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren\u2019t confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this dramatic change in Ministry policy,\u201d said Harry, \u201cinvolves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly part of it,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cand it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you \u2014 the Boy Who Lived \u2014 were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero\u2019s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.\u201d\n\nLupin pointed at the Daily Prophet.\n\n\u201cLook at page two.\u201d\n\nHermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had worn when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art.\n\n\u201c\u2018Muggle-born Register,\u2019\u201d she read aloud. \u201c\u2018The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called \u201cMuggle-borns,\u201d the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets.\n\n\u201c\u2018Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople won\u2019t let this happen,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cIt is happening, Ron,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cMuggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how are they supposed to have \u2018stolen\u2019 magic?\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn\u2019t be any Squibs, would there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cNevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.\u201d\n\nRon glanced at Hermione, then said, \u201cWhat if purebloods and half-bloods swear a Muggle-born\u2019s part of their family? I\u2019ll tell everyone Hermione\u2019s my cousin \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione covered Ron\u2019s hand with hers and squeezed it.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ron, but I couldn\u2019t let you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have a choice,\u201d said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it.\u201d\n\nHermione gave a shaky laugh.\n\n\u201cRon, as we\u2019re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don\u2019t think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What\u2019s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?\u201d she asked Lupin.\n\n\u201cAttendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat was announced yesterday. It\u2019s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it\u2019s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status \u2014 meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent \u2014 before they are allowed to attend.\u201d\n\nHarry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spellbooks, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s . . .\u201d he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly,\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nLupin hesitated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll understand if you can\u2019t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did,\u201d Harry replied, \u201cand Ron and Hermione are in on it and they\u2019re coming with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you confide in me what the mission is?\u201d\n\nHarry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Remus, I\u2019m sorry. If Dumbledore didn\u2019t tell you I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that,\u201d said Lupin, looking disappointed. \u201cBut I might still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine.\n\nHermione, however, looked puzzled.\n\n\u201cBut what about Tonks?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione, frowning, \u201cyou\u2019re married! How does she feel about you going away with us?\u201d\n\n\u201cTonks will be perfectly safe,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cShe\u2019ll be at her parents\u2019 house.\u201d\n\nThere was something strange in Lupin\u2019s tone; it was almost cold. There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents\u2019 house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action.\n\n\u201cRemus,\u201d said Hermione tentatively, \u201cis everything all right . . . you know . . . between you and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is fine, thank you,\u201d said Lupin pointedly.\n\nHermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, \u201cTonks is going to have a baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, how wonderful!\u201d squealed Hermione.\n\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d said Ron enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d said Harry.\n\nLupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, \u201cSo . . . do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione both looked at Harry.\n\n\u201cJust \u2014 just to be clear,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to leave Tonks at her parents\u2019 house and come away with us?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be perfectly safe there, they\u2019ll look after her,\u201d said Lupin. He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference. \u201cHarry, I\u2019m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry slowly, \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you aren\u2019t sticking with your own kid, actually.\u201d\n\nLupin\u2019s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione\u2019s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Lupin at last.\n\n\u201cExplain, then,\u201d said Harry.\n\nLupin swallowed.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and I have regretted it very much ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Harry, \u201cso you\u2019re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?\u201d\n\nLupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the wolf upon his human face.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you understand what I\u2019ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have married her, I\u2019ve made her an outcast!\u201d\n\nLupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned.\n\n\u201cYou have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore\u2019s protection at Hogwarts! You don\u2019t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don\u2019t you see what I\u2019ve done? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child \u2014 the child \u2014\u201d\n\nLupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged.\n\n\u201cMy kind don\u2019t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it \u2014 how can I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of whom it must always be ashamed!\u201d\n\n\u201cRemus!\u201d whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t say that \u2014 how could any child be ashamed of you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, Hermione,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty ashamed of him.\u201d\n\nHarry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him.\n\n\u201cIf the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,\u201d Harry said, \u201cwhat will they do to a half-werewolf whose father\u2019s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he\u2019d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow \u2014 how dare you?\u201d said Lupin. \u201cThis is not about a desire for \u2014 for danger or personal glory \u2014 how dare you suggest such a \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re feeling a bit of a daredevil,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou fancy stepping into Sirius\u2019s shoes \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, no!\u201d Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin\u2019s livid face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never have believed this,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe man who taught me to fight dementors \u2014 a coward.\u201d\n\nLupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin\u2019s cloak disappearing around the door.\n\n\u201cRemus, Remus, come back!\u201d Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d wailed Hermione. \u201cHow could you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was easy,\u201d said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d he snapped at Hermione.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you start on her!\u201d snarled Ron.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no \u2014 we mustn\u2019t fight!\u201d said Hermione, launching herself between them.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have said that stuff to Lupin,\u201d Ron told Harry.\n\n\u201cHe had it coming to him,\u201d said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his mother\u2019s voice, begging for mercy . . .\n\n\u201cParents,\u201d said Harry, \u201cshouldn\u2019t leave their kids unless \u2014 unless they\u2019ve got to.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014\u201d said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin\u2019s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently.\n\nHe turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from each other.\n\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have called him a coward.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Ron at once.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s acting like one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the same . . .\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut if it makes him go back to Tonks, it\u2019ll be worth it, won\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHe could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend?\n\nThe silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione\u2019s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry\u2019s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore\u2019s name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth.\n\nHis attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore\u2019s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet-black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he\u2019d seen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus\u2019s nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses.\n\nThe family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby Ariana\u2019s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the headline:\n\nEXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM THE UPCOMING BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\nby Rita Skeeter\n\n\n\nThinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read:\n\nProud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival\u2019s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric\u2019s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter\u2019s strange escape from You-Know-Who.\n\nLike Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric\u2019s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband\u2019s crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone.\n\n\u201cSlammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,\u201d says Bathilda Bagshot. \u201cThe first year they were there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn\u2019t have known there was a daughter if I hadn\u2019t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn\u2019t know what to make of it.\u201d\n\nIt seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric\u2019s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter\u2019s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana\u2019s existence could be counted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them: \u201cMy sister is too frail for school.\u201d\n\nNext week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts \u2014 the Prizes and the Pretense.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him; he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen.\n\nFor the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, \u201cKreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.\u201d\n\nMundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him.\n\n\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d\n\nMundungus\u2019s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron\u2019s grip. \u201cWha\u2019ve I done? Setting a bleedin\u2019 \u2019ouse-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha\u2019ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, or \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in much of a position to make threats,\u201d said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus\u2019s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke: His hair was matted and his robes stained.\n\n\u201cKreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,\u201d croaked the elf. \u201cFletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done really well, Kreacher,\u201d said Harry, and the elf bowed low.\n\n\u201cRight, we\u2019ve got a few questions for you,\u201d Harry told Mundungus, who shouted at once,\n\n\u201cI panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an\u2019 that was bleedin\u2019 You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there, I said all along I didn\u2019t wanna do it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re a bunch of bleedin\u2019 \u2019eroes then, aren\u2019t you, but I never pretended I was up for killing meself \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,\u201d said Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus\u2019s baggy, bloodshot eyes. \u201cWe already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, why the \u2019ell am I being \u2019unted down by \u2019ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets again? I ain\u2019t got none of \u2019em left, or you could \u2019ave \u2019em \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the goblets either, although you\u2019re getting warmer,\u201d said Harry. \u201cShut up and listen.\u201d\n\nIt felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth. Harry\u2019s wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundungus\u2019s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view.\n\n\u201cWhen you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,\u201d Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again.\n\n\u201cSirius never cared about any of the junk \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was the sound of pattering feet, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, and a shriek of agony: Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan.\n\n\u201cCall \u2019im off, call \u2019im off, \u2019e should be locked up!\u201d screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again.\n\n\u201cKreacher, no!\u201d shouted Harry.\n\nKreacher\u2019s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft.\n\n\u201cPerhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?\u201d\n\nRon laughed.\n\n\u201cWe need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading you can do the honors,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThank you very much, Master,\u201d said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing.\n\n\u201cWhen you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,\u201d Harry began again, \u201cyou took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.\u201d Harry\u2019s mouth was suddenly dry: He could sense Ron and Hermione\u2019s tension and excitement too. \u201cWhat did you do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Mundungus. \u201cIs it valuable?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve still got it!\u201d cried Hermione.\n\n\u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Ron shrewdly. \u201cHe\u2019s wondering whether he should have asked more money for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore?\u201d said Mundungus. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have been effing difficult . . . bleedin\u2019 gave it away, di\u2019n\u2019 I? No choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I\u2019ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin\u2019 snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an\u2019 told me she\u2019d take it and let me off that time, and to fink meself lucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was this woman?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cI dunno, some Ministry hag.\u201d\n\nMundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled.\n\n\u201cLittle woman. Bow on top of \u2019er head.\u201d\n\nHe frowned and then added, \u201cLooked like a toad.\u201d\n\nHarry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, which ignited.\n\n\u201cAguamenti!\u201d screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus.\n\nHarry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter12": "MAGIC IS MIGHT\n\n\n\n\nAs August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anybody in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself. The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.\n\nAnd yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear such long cloaks in this heat.\n\nThe watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed.\n\nOn the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed.\n\nMeanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand.\n\nThe usual low whisper of \u201cSeverus Snape?\u201d greeted him, the chill wind swept him, and his tongue rolled up for a moment.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t kill you,\u201d he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, \u201cI\u2019ve got news, and you won\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nThe kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone: Copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf who now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus\u2019s locket bouncing on his thin chest.\n\n\u201cShoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,\u201d croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment.\n\nA large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read:\n\nSEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER\n\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Ron and Hermione loudly.\n\nHermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud.\n\n\u201c\u2018Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.\n\n\u201c\u2018I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values \u2014\u2019 Like committing murder and cutting off people\u2019s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore\u2019s study \u2014 Merlin\u2019s pants!\u201d she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Merlin\u2019s pants\u2019?\u201d repeated Ron, looking amused. \u201cShe must be upset.\u201d He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape.\n\n\u201cThe other teachers won\u2019t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won\u2019t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath Eaters,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it\u2019s all friends together. And,\u201d Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, \u201cI can\u2019t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it\u2019ll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban \u2014 and that\u2019s if they\u2019re lucky. I reckon they\u2019ll stay to try and protect the students.\u201d\n\nKreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so.\n\n\u201cThanks, Kreacher,\u201d said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape\u2019s face. \u201cWell, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.\u201d\n\nHe began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher\u2019s cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus\u2019s locket: Today\u2019s French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted.\n\n\u201cThere are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,\u201d he told Ron as he ate, \u201cmore than usual. It\u2019s like they\u2019re hoping we\u2019ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.\u201d\n\nRon glanced at his watch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIn his mind\u2019s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape\u2019s new regime.\n\n\u201cThey nearly saw me coming back in just now,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do that every time. Oh, here she is,\u201d Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. \u201cAnd what in the name of Merlin\u2019s most baggy Y Fronts was that about?\u201d\n\n\u201cI remembered this,\u201d Hermione panted.\n\nShe was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside, and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much else, into the bag\u2019s capacious depths.\n\n\u201cPhineas Nigellus,\u201d Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster\u2019s office at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore\u2019s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cSnape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,\u201d Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. \u201cBut let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood thinking!\u201d said Ron, looking impressed.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. \u201cSo, Harry, what else happened today?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWatched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw your dad, though, Ron. He looks fine.\u201d\n\nRon nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious.\n\n\u201cDad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,\u201d Ron said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen Umbridge, she\u2019d never walk, she\u2019d think she\u2019s too important.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?\u201d Hermione asked.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cHow do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?\u201d Hermione asked, her soupspoon suspended in midair.\n\n\u201cDad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you never told us that!\u201d\n\nHermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!\u201d she said, flipping feverishly through the pages.\n\n\u201cWell, does it really matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, it all matters! If we\u2019re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they\u2019re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We\u2019ve been over and over this, I mean, what\u2019s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren\u2019t even bothering to tell us \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do realize, don\u2019t you, that there\u2019s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should do it tomorrow,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup.\n\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d repeated Hermione. \u201cYou aren\u2019t serious, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There\u2019s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn\u2019t open.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless,\u201d said Ron, \u201cshe\u2019s found a way of opening it and she\u2019s now possessed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,\u201d Harry shrugged.\n\nHermione was biting her lip, deep in thought.\n\n\u201cWe know everything important,\u201d Harry went on, addressing Hermione. \u201cWe know they\u2019ve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge\u2019s office is, because of what you heard that bearded bloke saying to his mate \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,\u2019\u201d Hermione recited immediately.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t got any!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the plan works, we will have,\u201d Harry continued calmly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Harry, I don\u2019t know. . . . There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s time to act.\u201d\n\nHe could tell from Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s faces that they were scared; he was not particularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.\n\nThey had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebody\u2019s briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Ron slowly, \u201clet\u2019s say we go for it tomorrow. . . . I think it should just be me and Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t start that again!\u201d sighed Hermione. \u201cI thought we\u2019d settled this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different, Hermione.\u201d Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. \u201cYou\u2019re on the list of Muggle-borns who didn\u2019t present themselves for interrogation!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone shouldn\u2019t go, it\u2019s Harry, he\u2019s got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll stay here,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLet me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAs Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead. His hand jumped to it: He saw Hermione\u2019s eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes.\n\n\u201cWell, if all three of us go we\u2019ll have to Disapparate separately,\u201d Ron was saying. \u201cWe can\u2019t all fit under the Cloak anymore.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried forward.\n\n\u201cMaster has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Kreacher, but I\u2019ll be back in a minute \u2014 er \u2014 bathroom.\u201d\n\nAware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes. . . .\n\nHe was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread houses.\n\nHe approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mounting excitement. . . .\n\nThe door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry\u2019s face: humor gone, terror replacing it. . . .\n\n\u201cGregorovitch?\u201d said a high, cold voice.\n\nShe shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented her shutting him out. . . .\n\n\u201cI want Gregorovitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr wohnt hier nicht mehr!\u201d she cried, shaking her head. \u201cHe no live here! He no live here! I know him not!\u201d\n\nAbandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand.\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cDas wei\u00df ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!\u201d\n\nHe raised the wand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light \u2014\n\n\u201cHarry! HARRY!\u201d\n\nHe opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door again.\n\n\u201cHarry, open up!\u201d\n\nHe had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d asked Hermione sternly.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think I was doing?\u201d asked Harry with feeble bravado.\n\n\u201cYou were yelling your head off!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOh yeah . . . I must\u2019ve dozed off or \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, please don\u2019t insult our intelligence,\u201d said Hermione, taking deep breaths. \u201cWe know your scar hurt downstairs, and you\u2019re white as a sheet.\u201d\n\nHarry sat down on the edge of the bath.\n\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he\u2019s probably killed her whole family. And he didn\u2019t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you aren\u2019t supposed to let this happen anymore!\u201d Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. \u201cDumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! He thought the connection was dangerous \u2014 Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it means I know what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not even going to try to shut him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, I can\u2019t. You know I\u2019m lousy at Occlumency, I never got the hang of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never really tried!\u201d she said hotly. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, Harry \u2014 do you like having this special connection or relationship or what \u2014 whatever \u2014\u201d\n\nShe faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up.\n\n\u201cLike it?\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWould you like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 no \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, Harry, I didn\u2019t mean \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he\u2019s most dangerous. But I\u2019m going to use it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cForget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else\u2019s. I want to know why he\u2019s after Gregorovitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a foreign wandmaker,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe made Krum\u2019s wand and Krum reckons he\u2019s brilliant.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut according to you,\u201d said Ron, \u201cVoldemort\u2019s got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he\u2019s already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better . . . or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back.\n\n\u201cHarry, you keep talking about what your wand did,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cbut you made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I know it wasn\u2019t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!\u201d\n\nThey glared at each other: Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemort\u2019s mind. To his relief, Ron intervened.\n\n\u201cDrop it,\u201d he advised her. \u201cIt\u2019s up to him. And if we\u2019re going to the Ministry tomorrow, don\u2019t you reckon we should go over the plan?\u201d\n\nReluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart.\n\nThey did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius\u2019s room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly.\n\nDawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.\n\n\u201cYou look terrible,\u201d was Ron\u2019s greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry.\n\n\u201cNot for long,\u201d said Harry, yawning.\n\nThey found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review.\n\n\u201cRobes,\u201d she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, \u201cPolyjuice Potion . . . Invisibility Cloak . . . Decoy Detonators . . . You should each take a couple just in case. . . . Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable Ears . . .\u201d\n\nThey gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned.\n\n\u201cBless him,\u201d said Ron fondly, \u201cand when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.\u201d\n\nThey made their way onto the front step with immense caution: They could see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square.\n\nHermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry.\n\nAfter the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight o\u2019clock.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d said Hermione, checking her watch. \u201cShe ought to be here in about five minutes. When I\u2019ve Stunned her \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, we know,\u201d said Ron sternly. \u201cAnd I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?\u201d\n\nHermione squealed.\n\n\u201cI nearly forgot! Stand back \u2014\u201d\n\nShe pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it look as though it was still closed.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d she said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway, \u201cwe put on the Cloak again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and we wait,\u201d Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione\u2019s head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry.\n\nLittle more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness; the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione\u2019s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.\n\n\u201cNicely done, Hermione,\u201d said Ron, emerging from behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch\u2019s head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch\u2019s handbag.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s Mafalda Hopkirk,\u201d he said, reading a small card that identified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. \u201cYou\u2019d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.\u201d\n\nHe passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., which he had taken from the witch\u2019s purse.\n\nHermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda\u2019s spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.\u201d\n\nThey hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, and a small, ferrety-looking wizard appeared before them.\n\n\u201cOh, hello, Mafalda.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d said Hermione in a quavery voice. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so good, actually,\u201d replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast.\n\nAs Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re under the weather,\u201d said Hermione, talking firmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street. \u201cHere, have a sweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh? Oh, no thanks \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI insist!\u201d said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one.\n\nThe effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head.\n\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d better take the day off!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no!\u201d He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight. \u201cI must \u2014 today \u2014 must go \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just silly!\u201d said Hermione, alarmed. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to work in this state \u2014 I think you ought to go to St. Mungo\u2019s and get them to sort you out!\u201d\n\nThe wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the main street.\n\n\u201cYou simply can\u2019t go to work like this!\u201d cried Hermione.\n\nAt last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a repulsed Hermione to claw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit.\n\n\u201cUrgh,\u201d said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid the puddles of sick. \u201cIt would have made much less mess to Stun him too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard\u2019s bag, \u201cbut I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn\u2019t he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.\u201d\n\nWithin two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag.\n\n\u201cWeird he wasn\u2019t wearing them today, wasn\u2019t it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, I\u2019m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow wait here,\u201d Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, \u201cand we\u2019ll be back with some hairs for you.\u201d\n\nHe had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, \u201cbut he\u2019s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he\u2019s pretty tall, you\u2019ll need bigger robes. . . .\u201d\n\nShe pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change.\n\nOnce the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two.\n\n\u201cBlimey, that\u2019s scary,\u201d said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him.\n\n\u201cTake one of Mafalda\u2019s tokens,\u201d Hermione told Harry, \u201cand let\u2019s go, it\u2019s nearly nine.\u201d\n\nThey stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of steps, one labeled GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES.\n\n\u201cSee you in a moment, then,\u201d said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.\n\n\u201cMorning, Reg!\u201d called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. \u201cBlooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?\u201d\n\nThe wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cstupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nAnd he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.\n\nTo Harry\u2019s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.\n\n\u201cWe have to flush ourselves in?\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cLooks like it,\u201d Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly.\n\nThey both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet.\n\nHe knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic.\n\nHe got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT.\n\nHarry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, can\u2019t y \u2014 oh, sorry, Runcorn!\u201d\n\nClearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man whom Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating.\n\n\u201cPsst!\u201d said a voice, and he looked around to see a wispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them.\n\n\u201cYou got in all right, then?\u201d Hermione whispered to Harry.\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s still stuck in the bog,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOh, very funny . . . It\u2019s horrible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. \u201cHave you seen what they\u2019re sitting on?\u201d\n\nHarry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards.\n\n\u201cMuggles,\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cIn their rightful place. Come on, let\u2019s get going.\u201d\n\nThey joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, \u201cCattermole!\u201d\n\nThey looked around: Harry\u2019s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore\u2019s death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The man\u2019s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, \u201cMorning, Yaxley!\u201d Yaxley ignored them.\n\n\u201cI requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, Cattermole. It\u2019s still raining in there.\u201d\n\nRon looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke.\n\n\u201cRaining . . . in your office? That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s not good, is it?\u201d\n\nRon gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley\u2019s eyes widened.\n\n\u201cYou think it\u2019s funny, Cattermole, do you?\u201d\n\nA pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, \u201cno, of course \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I\u2019m quite surprised you\u2019re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.\u201d\n\nHermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She coughed feebly and turned away.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I \u2014\u201d stammered Ron.\n\n\u201cBut if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,\u201d said Yaxley, \u201c\u2014 not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth \u2014 and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do that job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d whispered Ron.\n\n\u201cThen attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an hour, your wife\u2019s Blood Status will be in even graver doubt than it is now.\u201d\n\nThe golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward.\n\n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. \u201cIf I don\u2019t turn up, my wife \u2014 I mean, Cattermole\u2019s wife \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll come with you, we should stick together \u2014\u201d began Harry, but Ron shook his head feverishly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s mental, we haven\u2019t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I\u2019ll go and sort out Yaxley\u2019s office \u2014 but how do I stop it raining?\u201d\n\n\u201cTry Finite Incantatem,\u201d said Hermione at once, \u201cthat should stop the rain if it\u2019s a hex or curse; if it doesn\u2019t, something\u2019s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSay it again, slowly \u2014\u201d said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, \u201cLevel four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,\u201d and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.\n\n\u201cMorning, Albert,\u201d said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttered, \u201cDirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I\u2019m pretty confident I\u2019ll get his job now!\u201d\n\nHe winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more.\n\n\u201cLevel two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services,\u201d said the disembodied witch\u2019s voice.\n\nHarry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione said, very fast, \u201cActually, Harry, I think I\u2019d better go after him, I don\u2019t think he knows what he\u2019s doing and if he gets caught the whole thing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLevel one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.\u201d\n\nThe golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood before them, two of them deep in conversation: a long-haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and a squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her chest."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter13": "THE MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION\n\n\n\n\nAh, Mafalda!\u201d said Umbridge, looking at Hermione. \u201cTravers sent you, did he?\u201d\n\n\u201cY-yes,\u201d squeaked Hermione.\n\n\u201cGood, you\u2019ll do perfectly well.\u201d Umbridge spoke to the wizard in black and gold. \u201cThat\u2019s that problem solved, Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for record-keeping we shall be able to start straightaway.\u201d She consulted her clipboard. \u201cTen people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut . . . even here, in the heart of the Ministry!\u201d She stepped into the lift beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been listening to Umbridge\u2019s conversation with the Minister. \u201cWe\u2019ll go straight down, Mafalda, you\u2019ll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren\u2019t you getting out?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Harry in Runcorn\u2019s deep voice.\n\nHarry stepped out of the lift. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. Glancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione\u2019s anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of her, Umbridge\u2019s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder.\n\n\u201cWhat brings you up here, Runcorn?\u201d asked the new Minister of Magic. His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock.\n\n\u201cNeeded a quick word with,\u201d Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, \u201cArthur Weasley. Someone said he was up on level one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Pius Thicknesse. \u201cHas he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, his throat dry. \u201cNo, nothing like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, well. It\u2019s only a matter of time,\u201d said Thicknesse. \u201cIf you ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood day, Minister.\u201d\n\nHarry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden.\n\nPanic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner\u2019s name and occupation upon it, the might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being detected: They had not given a moment\u2019s thought to what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman\u2019s liberty possibly depending on the outcome; and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift.\n\nHe stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The silence pressed upon him: There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here; the purple-carpeted corridors were as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the place.\n\nHer office must be up here, Harry thought.\n\nIt seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment.\n\nNow paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed the same pattern; and after a few more seconds he realized that what he was watching was the creation of pamphlets \u2014 that the paper squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard.\n\nHarry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was emblazoned with a golden title:\n\nMUDBLOODS\n\nand the Dangers They Pose to\n\na Peaceful Pure-Blood Society\n\n\n\nBeneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals, being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author\u2019s name upon the pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her wand, \u201cWill the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful,\u201d said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor.\n\n\u201cWhat, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?\u201d\n\nThe witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and rage reared in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had been set into the wood \u2014 an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody.\n\nFor a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving: It gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read:\n\nDOLORES UMBRIDGE\n\nSENIOR UNDERSECRETARY TO THE MINISTER\n\n\n\nBelow that, a slightly shinier new plaque read:\n\nHEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN\n\nREGISTRATION COMMISSION\n\n\n\nHarry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground.\n\nIt scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him. A few moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner. The young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge\u2019s office, and closed the door behind him.\n\nHe felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge\u2019s office at Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies, and dried flowers covered every available surface. The walls bore the same ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy, flowered cloth. Behind Mad-Eye\u2019s eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. Then he turned to face the room again, raised his wand, and murmured, \u201cAccio Locket.\u201d\n\nNothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all about protective charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open the drawers. He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign of a locket.\n\nThere was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to searching it. Like Filch\u2019s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his search: Mr. Weasley\u2019s file.\n\nHe pulled it out and opened it.\n\nARTHUR WEASLEY\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nBLOOD STATUS: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings. Known member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n\nFAMILY: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have confirmed.\n\nSECURITY STATUS: TRACKED. All movements are being monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will contact (has stayed with Weasley family previously)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cUndesirable Number One,\u201d Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr. Weasley\u2019s folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places, he saw a poster of himself on the wall, with the words UNDESIRABLE NO. 1 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and saw that Umbridge had written, \u201cTo be punished.\u201d\n\nAngrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the office one last sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk.\n\nHarry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book. Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat \u2014 The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore \u2014 nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest: \u201cby Rita Skeeter, bestselling author of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?\u201d\n\nHarry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum\u2019s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a young Doge, but before he could check the caption, the door of the office opened.\n\nIf Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he remained quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that all he had seen was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced it upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond.\n\nThe pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, \u201cI bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they\u2019re so careless, remember that poisonous duck?\u201d\n\nSpeeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to find Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom.\n\nThe lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as it started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-eyed Ron got in.\n\n\u201cM-morning,\u201d he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again.\n\n\u201cRon, it\u2019s me, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like \u2014 why isn\u2019t Hermione with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn\u2019t refuse, and \u2014\u201d\n\nBut before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again: The doors opened and Mr. Weasley walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an anthill.\n\n\u201c. . . I quite understand what you\u2019re saying, Wakanda, but I\u2019m afraid I cannot be party to \u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more.\n\n\u201cOh, hello, Reg,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Ron\u2019s robes. \u201cIsn\u2019t your wife in for questioning today? Er \u2014 what\u2019s happened to you? Why are you so wet?\u201d\n\n\u201cYaxley\u2019s office is raining,\u201d said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley\u2019s shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other\u2019s eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop it, so they\u2019ve sent me to get Bernie \u2014 Pillsworth, I think they said \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cDid you try Meteolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeteolojinx Recanto?\u201d whispered Ron. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Thanks, D \u2014 I mean, thanks, Arthur.\u201d\n\nThe lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his nose buried in some papers he was reading.\n\nNot until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. Weasley\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cOne moment, Runcorn.\u201d\n\nThe lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley said, \u201cI hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.\u201d\n\nHarry had the impression that Mr. Weasley\u2019s anger was no less because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend, Runcorn,\u201d said Mr. Weasley fiercely. \u201cYou tracked down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 so what if I did?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cSo Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,\u201d said Mr. Weasley quietly, as the lift sank ever lower. \u201cAnd if he survives Azkaban, you\u2019ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his sons, and his friends \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur,\u201d Harry interrupted, \u201cyou know you\u2019re being tracked, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a threat, Runcorn?\u201d said Mr. Weasley loudly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cit\u2019s a fact! They\u2019re watching your every move \u2014\u201d\n\nThe lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody other than Runcorn. . . . The lift doors clanged shut.\n\nHarry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining office. When the doors opened, he stepped out into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood-paneled and carpeted corridors above. As the lift rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries.\n\nHe set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. His mind grappled with possibilities as he crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed it, Hermione\u2019s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they were clear of the Ministry. . . .\n\nLost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took: a cold that reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs. And then he felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him. . . .\n\nDementors, he thought.\n\nAnd as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black-hooded figures, their faces completely hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors\u2019 greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding up and down in front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse. . . .\n\nFight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here without revealing himself instantly. So he moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him.\n\nMoving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence that still had some hope, some resilience. . . .\n\nAnd then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it.\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m half-blood, I\u2019m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he\u2019s a well-known broomstick designer, look him up, I tell you \u2014 get your hands off me, get your hands off \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is your final warning,\u201d said Umbridge\u2019s soft voice, magically magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man\u2019s desperate screams. \u201cIf you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor\u2019s Kiss.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor.\n\n\u201cTake him away,\u201d said Umbridge.\n\nTwo dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting, scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. They glided away down the corridor with him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight.\n\n\u201cNext \u2014 Mary Cattermole,\u201d called Umbridge.\n\nA small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long, plain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed the dementors, Harry saw her shudder.\n\nHe did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her.\n\nIt was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic. This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well.\n\nThere were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high, raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite as white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect the prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice.\n\nMrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there.\n\n\u201cYou are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?\u201d asked Umbridge.\n\nMrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod.\n\n\u201cMarried to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?\u201d\n\nMrs. Cattermole burst into tears.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!\u201d\n\nUmbridge ignored her.\n\n\u201cMother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?\u201d\n\nMrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re frightened, they think I might not come home \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSpare us,\u201d spat Yaxley. \u201cThe brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.\u201d\n\nMrs. Cattermole\u2019s sobs masked Harry\u2019s footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat patrolled, he felt the change in temperature: It was warm and comfortable here. The Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridge\u2019s, and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in her element, upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making Hermione jump. He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m behind you,\u201d he whispered into Hermione\u2019s ear.\n\nAs he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed.\n\n\u201cA wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,\u201d Umbridge was saying. \u201cEight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that description?\u201d\n\nMrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve.\n\n\u201cCould you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?\u201d\n\n\u201cT-took?\u201d sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. \u201cI didn\u2019t t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it when I was eleven years old. It \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 chose me.\u201d\n\nShe cried harder than ever.\n\nUmbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold swung forward too, and dangled over the void: the locket.\n\nHermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything else.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Umbridge, \u201cno, I don\u2019t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here \u2014 Mafalda, pass them to me.\u201d\n\nUmbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione\u2019s hands were shaking with shock. She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s name on it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s pretty, Dolores,\u201d she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge\u2019s blouse.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d snapped Umbridge, glancing down. \u201cOh yes \u2014 an old family heirloom,\u201d she said, patting the locket lying on her large bosom. \u201cThe S stands for Selwyn. . . . I am related to the Selwyns. . . . Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related. . . . A pity,\u201d she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s questionnaire, \u201cthat the same cannot be said for you. \u2018Parents\u2019 professions: greengrocers.\u2019\u201d\n\nYaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners.\n\nIt was Umbridge\u2019s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry\u2019s brain and obliterated his sense of caution \u2014 that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bolster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, \u201cStupefy!\u201d\n\nThere was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, confused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry\u2019s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his own wand, but too late: \u201cStupefy!\u201d\n\nYaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, Mrs. Cattermole!\u201d\n\nHarry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the dementors had moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back.\n\n\u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d\n\nThe silver stag soared from the tip of Harry\u2019s wand and leaped toward the dementors, which fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag\u2019s light, more powerful and more warming than the cat\u2019s protection, filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around and around the room.\n\n\u201cGet the Horcrux,\u201d Harry told Hermione.\n\nHe ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak back into his bag, and approached Mrs. Cattermole.\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d she whispered, gazing into his face. \u201cBut \u2014 but Reg said you were the one who submitted my name for questioning!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I?\u201d muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve had a change of heart. Diffindo!\u201d Nothing happened. \u201cHermione, how do I get rid of these chains?\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, I\u2019m trying something up here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, we\u2019re surrounded by dementors!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket\u2019s gone \u2014 I need to duplicate it \u2014 Geminio! There . . . That should fool her. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione came running downstairs.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see. . . . Relashio!\u201d\n\nThe chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to leave here with us,\u201d said Harry, pulling her to her feet. \u201cGo home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the country if you\u2019ve got to. Disguise yourselves and run. You\u2019ve seen how it is, you won\u2019t get anything like a fair hearing here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside the door?\u201d\n\n\u201cPatronuses,\u201d said Harry, pointing his wand at his own: The stag slowed and walked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door. \u201cAs many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cExpec \u2014 Expecto patronum,\u201d said Hermione. Nothing happened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only spell she ever has trouble with,\u201d Harry told a completely bemused Mrs. Cattermole. \u201cBit unfortunate, really . . . Come on, Hermione. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cExpecto patronum!\u201d\n\nA silver otter burst from the end of Hermione\u2019s wand and swam gracefully through the air to join the stag.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door.\n\nWhen the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back on both sides of them, melding into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families,\u201d Harry told the waiting Muggle-borns, who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering slightly. \u201cGo abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That\u2019s the \u2014 er \u2014 new official position. Now, if you\u2019ll just follow the Patronuses, you\u2019ll be able to leave from the Atrium.\u201d\n\nThey managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted, but as they approached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them.\n\n\u201cReg!\u201d screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron\u2019s arms. \u201cRuncorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he\u2019s told all of us to leave the country, I think we\u2019d better do it, Reg, I really do, let\u2019s hurry home and fetch the children and \u2014 why are you so wet?\u201d\n\n\u201cWater,\u201d muttered Ron, disengaging himself. \u201cHarry, they know there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge\u2019s office door, I reckon we\u2019ve got five minutes if that \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror-struck face to Harry.\n\n\u201cHarry, if we\u2019re trapped here \u2014 !\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be if we move fast,\u201d said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind them, who were all gawping at him.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s got wands?\u201d\n\nAbout half of them raised their hands.\n\n\u201cOkay, all of you who haven\u2019t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has. We\u2019ll need to be fast before they stop us. Come on.\u201d\n\nThey managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry\u2019s Patronus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise.\n\n\u201cLevel eight,\u201d said the witch\u2019s cool voice, \u201cAtrium.\u201d\n\nHarry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d squeaked Hermione. \u201cWhat are we going to \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the Atrium: The wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. \u201cFollow me,\u201d he whispered to the group of terrified Muggle-borns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Albert?\u201d said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out of the fireplace earlier. He looked nervous.\n\n\u201cThis lot need to leave before you seal the exits,\u201d said Harry with all the authority he could muster.\n\nThe group of wizards in front of him looked at one another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you contradicting me?\u201d Harry blustered. \u201cWould you like me to have your family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d gasped the balding wizard, backing away. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean nothing, Albert, but I thought . . . I thought they were in for questioning and . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir blood is pure,\u201d said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall. \u201cPurer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go,\u201d he boomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and resentful. Then:\n\n\u201cMary!\u201d\n\nMrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting but pale and wan, had just come running out of a lift.\n\n\u201cR-Reg?\u201d\n\nShe looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.\n\nThe balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other.\n\n\u201cHey \u2014 what\u2019s going on? What is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeal the exit! SEAL IT!\u201d\n\nYaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces, into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending him flying through the air.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!\u201d Harry shouted.\n\nThe balding wizard\u2019s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, \u201cMy wife! Who was that with my wife? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nHarry saw Yaxley\u2019s head turn, saw an inkling of the truth dawn in that brutish face.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley\u2019s curse sailed over Harry\u2019s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door; Ron was standing there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole.\n\n\u201cReg, I don\u2019t understand \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLet go, I\u2019m not your husband, you\u2019ve got to go home!\u201d\n\nThere was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around; Yaxley had just appeared.\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S GO!\u201d Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot.\n\nDarkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing bands, but something was wrong. . . . Hermione\u2019s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. . . .\n\nHe wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were Ron\u2019s arm and Hermione\u2019s fingers, which were slowly slipping away. . . .\n\nAnd then he saw the door of number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple light; Hermione\u2019s hand was suddenly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter14": "THE THIEF\n\n\n\n\nHarry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green; he had no idea what had happened, he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce creature, but saw that the object was Ron\u2019s foot. Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest floor, apparently alone.\n\nHarry\u2019s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid\u2019s hut. However, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer.\n\nHe met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron\u2019s head. The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry\u2019s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron\u2019s left side and his face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cSplinched,\u201d said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron\u2019s sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest.\n\nHarry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron\u2019s shirt. He had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this . . . His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron\u2019s upper arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife.\n\n\u201cHarry, quickly, in my bag, there\u2019s a small bottle labeled \u2018Essence of Dittany\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBag \u2014 right \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his touch: He felt the leather spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes \u2014\n\n\u201cQuickly!\u201d\n\nHe grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag.\n\n\u201cAccio Dittany!\u201d\n\nA small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fainted,\u201d said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places. \u201cUnstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.\u201d\n\nHarry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all I feel safe doing,\u201d said Hermione shakily. \u201cThere are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren\u2019t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage. . . . He\u2019s lost so much blood already. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he get hurt? I mean\u201d \u2014 Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken place \u2014 \u201cwhy are we here? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place?\u201d\n\nHermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears.\n\n\u201cHarry, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to go back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn\u2019t get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then \u2014 well, I think he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then, where\u2019s he? Hang on. . . . You don\u2019t mean he\u2019s at Grimmauld Place? He can\u2019t get in there?\u201d\n\nHer eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded.\n\n\u201cHarry, I think he can. I \u2014 I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I\u2019d already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm\u2019s protection. Since Dumbledore died, we\u2019re Secret-Keepers, so I\u2019ve given him the secret, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nThere was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak-and-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat.\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, it wasn\u2019t your fault! If anything, it was mine. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye\u2019s eye. Hermione recoiled, looking horrified.\n\n\u201cUmbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn\u2019t leave it there . . . but that\u2019s how they knew there were intruders.\u201d\n\nBefore Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He was still gray and his face glistened with sweat.\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you feel?\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\n\u201cLousy,\u201d croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 the first place you thought of,\u201d Harry finished for her, glancing around at the apparently deserted glade. He could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of \u2014 how Death Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had taken them?\n\n\u201cD\u2019you reckon we should move on?\u201d Ron asked Harry, and Harry could tell by the look on Ron\u2019s face that he was thinking the same.\n\n\u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\nRon still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stay here for now,\u201d Harry said.\n\nLooking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,\u201d she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing.\n\n\u201cSalvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTent?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the bag!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the . . . of course,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, rope, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup.\n\n\u201cI thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?\u201d he asked, starting to disentangle the tent pegs.\n\n\u201cApparently he didn\u2019t want it back, his lumbago\u2019s so bad,\u201d said Hermione, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand, \u201cso Ron\u2019s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto!\u201d she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one fluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before Harry, out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope.\n\n\u201cCave Inimicum,\u201d Hermione finished with a skyward flourish. \u201cThat\u2019s as much as I can do. At the very least, we should know they\u2019re coming, I can\u2019t guarantee it will keep out Vol \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say the name!\u201d Ron cut across her, his voice harsh.\n\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, \u201cbut it feels like a \u2014 a jinx or something. Can\u2019t we call him You-Know-Who \u2014 please?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore said fear of a name \u2014\u201d began Harry.\n\n\u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn\u2019t do Dumbledore much good in the end,\u201d Ron snapped back. \u201cJust \u2014 just show You-Know-Who some respect, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cRespect?\u201d Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition.\n\nHarry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent. The interior was exactly as Harry remembered it: a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make some tea,\u201d said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen.\n\nHarry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After a minute or two, Ron broke the silence.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith any luck, they\u2019ll have got away,\u201d said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort. \u201cAs long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he\u2019ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and they\u2019ll be fleeing the country right now with their children. That\u2019s what Harry told her to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, I hope they escaped,\u201d said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color had returned. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in Azkaban because of us . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask \u2014 about whether Mrs. Cattermole\u2019s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband \u2014 died in his throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him.\n\n\u201cSo, have you got it?\u201d Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there.\n\n\u201cGot \u2014 got what?\u201d she said with a little start.\n\n\u201cWhat did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where\u2019s the locket?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got it?\u201d shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. \u201cNo one tells me anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren\u2019t we?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHere.\u201d\n\nAnd she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron.\n\nIt was as large as a chicken\u2019s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent\u2019s canvas roof.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any chance someone\u2019s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?\u201d asked Ron hopefully. \u201cI mean, are we sure it\u2019s still a Horcrux?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. \u201cThere\u2019d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.\u201d\n\nShe passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, pristine. He remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it.\n\n\u201cI reckon Kreacher\u2019s right,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.\u201d\n\nSudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus\u2019s bedroom door. Neither worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been.\n\n\u201cCan you feel it, though?\u201d Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his clenched fist.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\nRon passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart?\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d Hermione asked.\n\n\u201cKeep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,\u201d Harry replied, and, little though he wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him.\n\n\u201cI think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,\u201d he added to Hermione, standing up and stretching. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll need to think about some food as well. You stay there,\u201d he added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green.\n\nWith the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at ten o\u2019clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing.\n\nHe felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed any food in her magical bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt Hermione\u2019s feelings.\n\nThe surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease.\n\nHe had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of road.\n\nThere were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own.\n\nNameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark: He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at him relentlessly. Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to: He could not. And it seemed to Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left. . . . Stupid idea, he told himself, don\u2019t think that. . . .\n\nHis scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making it happen by having these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry\u2019s head and he tried to push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and Hermione had already decided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione\u2019s sleeve.\n\nHarry\u2019s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not know: Lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn\u2019t Dumbledore explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live for years, for centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong. . . . Snape had seen to that. . . . Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower . . .\n\nAnd Dumbledore had fallen . . . fallen . . .\n\n\u201cGive it to me, Gregorovitch.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a long-fingered white hand. The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his limbs wrapped about him, his terrified face, on a level with Harry\u2019s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. He had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard: a trussed-up Father Christmas.\n\n\u201cI have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows. . . . He always knows.\u201d\n\nThe hanging man\u2019s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole \u2014\n\nAnd now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch\u2019s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair. In the split second that the lantern\u2019s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter.\n\nAnd Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and Gregorovitch\u2019s face was stricken with terror.\n\n\u201cWho was the thief, Gregorovitch?\u201d said the high cold voice.\n\n\u201cI do not know, I never knew, a young man \u2014 no \u2014 please \u2014 PLEASE!\u201d\n\nA scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light \u2014\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nHe opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had passed out against the side of the tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. He looked up at Hermione, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above them.\n\n\u201cDream,\u201d he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermione\u2019s glower with a look of innocence. \u201cMust\u2019ve dozed off, sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking into Vol \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say his name!\u201d came Ron\u2019s angry voice from the depths of the tent.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d retorted Hermione. \u201cYou-Know-Who\u2019s mind, then!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it to happen!\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt was a dream! Can you control what you dream about, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you just learned to apply Occlumency \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what he had just seen.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he\u2019s killed him, but before he killed him he read Gregorovitch\u2019s mind and I saw \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d better take over the watch if you\u2019re so tired you\u2019re falling asleep,\u201d said Hermione coldly.\n\n\u201cI can finish the watch!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.\u201d\n\nShe dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside.\n\nRon\u2019s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the one above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several moments, Ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s You-Know-Who doing?\u201d\n\nHarry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the darkness.\n\n\u201cHe found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he\u2019s tied up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno. . . . It\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHarry closed his eyes, thinking of all he had seen and heard. The more he recalled, the less sense it made . . . Voldemort had said nothing about Harry\u2019s wand, nothing about the twin cores, nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat Harry\u2019s. . . .\n\n\u201cHe wanted something from Gregorovitch,\u201d Harry said, eyes still closed tight. \u201cHe asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him . . . and then . . . then . . .\u201d\n\nHe remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through Gregorovitch\u2019s eyes, into his memories . . . .\n\n\u201cHe read Gregorovitch\u2019s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever You-Know-Who\u2019s after. And I . . . I think I\u2019ve seen him somewhere. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy\u2019s face. The theft had happened many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look familiar?\n\nThe noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could hear was Ron\u2019s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you see what the thief was holding?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo . . . it must\u2019ve been something small.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\nThe wooden slats of Ron\u2019s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed.\n\n\u201cHarry, you don\u2019t reckon You-Know-Who\u2019s after something else to turn into a Horcrux?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cMaybe. But wouldn\u2019t it be dangerous for him to make another one? Didn\u2019t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but maybe he doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . maybe,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and yet he had killed him, apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore.\n\nWhat was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the Wizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, and which had been stolen by the unknown thief?\n\nHarry could still see the blond-haired youth\u2019s face; it was merry, wild; there was a Fred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from the windowsill like a bird, and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . .\n\nWith Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and it was on him that Harry\u2019s thoughts dwelled, as Ron\u2019s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter15": "THE GOBLIN\u2019S REVENGE\n\n\n\n\nEarly next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye Moody\u2019s eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge\u2019s door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next.\n\nHarry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town.\n\nOnce they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments, Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood.\n\n\u201cBut you can make a brilliant Patronus!\u201d protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t . . . make one,\u201d he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. \u201cWouldn\u2019t . . . come.\u201d\n\nTheir expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry\u2019s willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went.\n\n\u201cSo we still haven\u2019t got any food.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, Ron,\u201d snapped Hermione. \u201cHarry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn\u2019t make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHe sat low in one of Perkins\u2019s old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago: Today he might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express.\n\nRon kicked a chair leg.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he snarled at Hermione. \u201cI\u2019m starving! All I\u2019ve had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go and fight your way through the dementors, then,\u201d said Harry, stung.\n\n\u201cI would, but my arm\u2019s in a sling, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s convenient.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that supposed to \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence. \u201cHarry, give me the locket! Come on,\u201d she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react, \u201cthe Horcrux, Harry, you\u2019re still wearing it!\u201d\n\nShe held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted contact with Harry\u2019s skin he felt free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cYeah, loads better!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, \u201cyou don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been possessed, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d he said defensively. \u201cI remember everything we\u2019ve done while I\u2019ve been wearing it. I wouldn\u2019t know what I\u2019d done if I\u2019d been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn\u2019t remember anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket. \u201cWell, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the tent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,\u201d Harry stated firmly. \u201cIf we lose it, if it gets stolen \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all right, all right,\u201d said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. \u201cBut we\u2019ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Ron irritably, \u201cand now we\u2019ve sorted that out, can we please get some food?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, but we\u2019ll go somewhere else to find it,\u201d said Hermione with half a glance at Harry. \u201cThere\u2019s no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around.\u201d\n\nIn the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not stealing, is it?\u201d asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. \u201cNot if I left some money under the chicken coop?\u201d\n\nRon rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, \u201c\u2019Er-my-nee, \u2019oo worry \u2019oo much. \u2019Elax!\u201d\n\nAnd, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed: The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches.\n\nThis was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys\u2019. Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron\u2019s turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant.\n\n\u201cSo where next?\u201d was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they had already got, their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no new information.\n\nAs Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and Burkes, where he had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis of their speculations.\n\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go to Albania. Shouldn\u2019t take more than an afternoon to search an entire country,\u201d said Ron sarcastically.\n\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be anything there. He\u2019d already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe know the snake\u2019s not in Albania, it\u2019s usually with Vol \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I ask you to stop saying that?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who \u2014 happy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot particularly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,\u201d said Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. \u201cBorgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would\u2019ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway.\u201d\n\nRon yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry plowed on, \u201cI still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nHermione sighed.\n\n\u201cBut Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!\u201d\n\nHarry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory.\n\n\u201cDumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwarts\u2019s secrets. I\u2019m telling you, if there was one place Vol \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d\n\n\u201cYOU-KNOW-WHO, then!\u201d Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. \u201cIf there was one place that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d scoffed Ron. \u201cHis school?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is You-Know-Who we\u2019re talking about, right? Not you?\u201d inquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around his neck: Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.\n\n\u201cYou told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAnd Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably another founder\u2019s object, to make into another Horcrux?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut he didn\u2019t get the job, did he?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cSo he never got the chance to find a founder\u2019s object there and hide it in the school!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, then,\u201d said Harry, defeated. \u201cForget Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nWithout any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. They visited its site and found a tower block of offices.\n\n\u201cWe could try digging in the foundations?\u201d Hermione suggested halfheartedly.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have hidden a Horcrux here,\u201d Harry said. He had known it all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with its golden doors and marble floors.\n\nEven without any new ideas, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety.\n\nHarry\u2019s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was wearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain.\n\n\u201cWhat? What did you see?\u201d demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince.\n\n\u201cA face,\u201d muttered Harry, every time. \u201cThe same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.\u201d\n\nAnd Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry\u2019s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes.\n\nAs the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.\n\nHarry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it.\n\nAutumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it: They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack of other people\u2019s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort.\n\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, \u201ccan make good food appear out of thin air.\u201d\n\nHe prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron\u2019s neck and saw, as he had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket.\n\n\u201cYour mother can\u2019t produce food out of thin air,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNo one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp\u2019s Law of Elemental Transfigur \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, speak English, can\u2019t you?\u201d Ron said, prising a fish bone out from between his teeth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you\u2019ve already got some \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t bother increasing this, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I\u2019m always the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I\u2019m a girl, I suppose!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s because you\u2019re supposed to be the best at magic!\u201d shot back Ron.\n\nHermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor.\n\n\u201cYou can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and I\u2019ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. \u201cShut up now!\u201d\n\nHermione looked outraged.\n\n\u201cHow can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!\u201d\n\nHe was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was not moving.\n\n\u201cYou cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?\u201d he whispered to Hermione.\n\n\u201cI did everything,\u201d she whispered back, \u201cMuffliato, Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn\u2019t be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.\u201d\n\nHeavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told them that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time.\n\nThe voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance.\n\nWithin seconds Harry heard a weary male voice.\n\n\u201cThere ought to be a few salmon in here, or d\u2019you reckon it\u2019s too early in the season? Accio Salmon!\u201d\n\nThere were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other.\n\nA fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large shadows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.\n\n\u201cHere, Griphook, Gornuk.\u201d\n\nGoblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said the goblins together in English.\n\n\u201cSo, you three have been on the run how long?\u201d asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man.\n\n\u201cSix weeks . . . seven . . . I forget,\u201d said the tired man. \u201cMet up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.\u201d There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. \u201cWhat made you leave, Ted?\u201d continued the man.\n\n\u201cKnew they were coming for me,\u201d replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks\u2019s father. \u201cHeard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I\u2019d better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I\u2019d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she\u2019s pure-blood. And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cMuggle-born, eh?\u201d asked the first man.\n\n\u201cNot sure,\u201d said Dean. \u201cMy dad left my mum when I was a kid. I\u2019ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.\u201d\n\nThere was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then Ted spoke again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to say, Dirk, I\u2019m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was you\u2019d been caught.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d said Dirk. \u201cI was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it, Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier than you\u2019d think; I don\u2019t reckon he\u2019s quite right at the moment. Might be Confunded. If so, I\u2019d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.\u201d\n\nThere was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. Then Ted said, \u201cAnd where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou had a false impression,\u201d said the higher-voiced of the goblins. \u201cWe take no sides. This is a wizards\u2019 war.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re in hiding, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI deemed it prudent,\u201d said the deeper-voiced goblin. \u201cHaving refused what I considered an impertinent request, I could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did they ask you to do?\u201d asked Ted.\n\n\u201cDuties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,\u201d replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less human as he said it. \u201cI am not a house-elf.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Griphook?\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilar reasons,\u201d said the higher-voiced goblin. \u201cGringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.\u201d\n\nHe added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the joke?\u201d asked Dean.\n\n\u201cHe said,\u201d replied Dirk, \u201cthat there are things wizards don\u2019t recognize, either.\u201d\n\nThere was a short pause.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d said Dean.\n\n\u201cI had my small revenge before I left,\u201d said Griphook in English.\n\n\u201cGood man \u2014 goblin, I should say,\u201d amended Ted hastily. \u201cDidn\u2019t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,\u201d replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle.\n\n\u201cDean and I are still missing something here,\u201d said Ted.\n\n\u201cSo is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,\u201d said Griphook, and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry\u2019s breathing was shallow with excitement: He and Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear about that, Ted?\u201d asked Dirk. \u201cAbout the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor\u2019s sword out of Snape\u2019s office at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\nAn electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot.\n\n\u201cNever heard a word,\u201d said Ted. \u201cNot in the Prophet, was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHardly,\u201d chortled Dirk. \u201cGriphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill\u2019s younger sister.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines.\n\n\u201cShe and a couple of friends got into Snape\u2019s office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, God bless \u2019em,\u201d said Ted. \u201cWhat did they think, that they\u2019d be able to use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn\u2019t safe where it was,\u201d said Dirk. \u201cCouple of days later, once he\u2019d got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.\u201d\n\nThe goblins started to laugh again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still not seeing the joke,\u201d said Ted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fake,\u201d rasped Griphook.\n\n\u201cThe sword of Gryffindor!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes. It is a copy \u2014 an excellent copy, it is true \u2014 but it was Wizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Ted. \u201cAnd I take it you didn\u2019t bother telling the Death Eaters this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw no reason to trouble them with the information,\u201d said Griphook smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk\u2019s laughter.\n\nInside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged; he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-boyfriend of Ginny\u2019s too.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried to steal it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they were punished, and cruelly,\u201d said Griphook indifferently.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re okay, though?\u201d asked Ted quickly. \u201cI mean, the Weasleys don\u2019t need any more of their kids injured, do they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,\u201d said Griphook.\n\n\u201cLucky for them,\u201d said Ted. \u201cWith Snape\u2019s track record I suppose we should just be glad they\u2019re still alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe that story, then, do you, Ted?\u201d asked Dirk. \u201cYou believe Snape killed Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course I do,\u201d said Ted. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHard to know what to believe these days,\u201d muttered Dirk.\n\n\u201cI know Harry Potter,\u201d said Dean. \u201cAnd I reckon he\u2019s the real thing \u2014 the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a lot would like to believe he\u2019s that, son,\u201d said Dirk, \u201cme included. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You\u2019d think, if he knew anything we don\u2019t, or had anything special going for him, he\u2019d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Prophet?\u201d scoffed Ted. \u201cYou deserve to be lied to if you\u2019re still reading that muck, Dirk. You want the facts, try the Quibbler.\u201d\n\nThere was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he spluttered, \u201cThe Quibbler? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so lunatic these days,\u201d said Ted. \u201cYou want to give it a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet\u2019s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. How long they\u2019ll let him get away with it, mind, I don\u2019t know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who\u2019s against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-one priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cHard to help a boy who\u2019s vanished off the face of the earth,\u201d said Dirk.\n\n\u201cListen, the fact that they haven\u2019t caught him yet\u2019s one hell of an achievement,\u201d said Ted. \u201cI\u2019d take tips from him gladly; it\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do, stay free, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019ve got a point there,\u201d said Dirk heavily. \u201cWith the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him I\u2019d have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who\u2019s to say they haven\u2019t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, don\u2019t say that, Dirk,\u201d murmured Ted.\n\nThere was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more than, \u201cGinny \u2014 the sword \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d said Hermione.\n\nShe lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit.\n\n\u201cHere . . . we . . . are . . .\u201d she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermione\u2019s bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment.\n\n\u201cIf somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore\u2019s office,\u201d she panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, \u201cPhineas Nigellus would have seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless he was asleep,\u201d said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said:\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?\u201d\n\nNothing happened.\n\n\u201cPhineas Nigellus?\u201d said Hermione again. \u201cProfessor Black? Please could we talk to you? Please?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Please\u2019 always helps,\u201d said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried:\n\n\u201cObscuro!\u201d\n\nA black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus\u2019s clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain.\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 how dare \u2014 what are you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, Professor Black,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cbut it\u2019s a necessary precaution!\u201d\n\n\u201cRemove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind where we are,\u201d said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold.\n\n\u201cCan that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus\u2019s interest. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of questions to ask you \u2014 about the sword of Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of Harry, \u201cyes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up about my sister,\u201d said Ron roughly. Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows.\n\n\u201cWho else is here?\u201d he asked, turning his head from side to side. \u201cYour tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t thieving,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat sword isn\u2019t Snape\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt belongs to Professor Snape\u2019s school,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus. \u201cExactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. \u201cWhere have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?\u201d asked Harry urgently.\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s not an oaf!\u201d said Hermione shrilly.\n\n\u201cAnd Snape might\u2019ve thought that was a punishment,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they\u2019ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!\u201d\n\nHe felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the very least.\n\n\u201cWhat we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it\u2019s been taken away for cleaning or \u2014 or something?\u201d\n\nPhineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered.\n\n\u201cMuggle-borns,\u201d he said. \u201cGoblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple girl. Goblins\u2019 silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call Hermione simple,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI grow weary of contradiction,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus. \u201cPerhaps it is time for me to return to the headmaster\u2019s office?\u201d\n\nStill blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration.\n\n\u201cDumbledore! Can\u2019t you bring us Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d asked Phineas Nigellus.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore\u2019s portrait \u2014 couldn\u2019t you bring him along, here, into yours?\u201d\n\nPhineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cEvidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves hanging elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure you that I shall not be making a return visit!\u201d\n\nSlightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame.\n\n\u201cProfessor Black,\u201d said Hermione, \u201ccouldn\u2019t you just tell us, please, when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?\u201d\n\nPhineas snorted impatiently.\n\n\u201cI believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.\u201d\n\nHermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the exit.\n\n\u201cWell, good night to you,\u201d he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout.\n\n\u201cWait! Have you told Snape you saw this?\u201d\n\nPhineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture.\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!\u201d\n\nAnd with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione cried.\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus\u2019s portrait back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry.\n\n\u201cThe sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthen them \u2014 Harry, that sword\u2019s impregnated with basilisk venom!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Dumbledore didn\u2019t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and he must have realized they wouldn\u2019t let you have it if he put it in his will \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 so he made a copy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and put a fake in the glass case \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and he left the real one \u2014 where?\u201d\n\nThey gazed at each other; Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn\u2019t Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not realized it at the time?\n\n\u201cThink!\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cThink! Where would he have left it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry, resuming his pacing.\n\n\u201cSomewhere in Hogsmeade?\u201d suggested Hermione.\n\n\u201cThe Shrieking Shack?\u201d said Harry. \u201cNobody ever goes in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Snape knows how to get in, wouldn\u2019t that be a bit risky?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore trusted Snape,\u201d Harry reminded her.\n\n\u201cNot enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right!\u201d said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however faint, about Snape\u2019s trustworthiness. \u201cSo, would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d\u2019you reckon, Ron? Ron?\u201d\n\nHarry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony.\n\n\u201cOh, remembered me, have you?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk.\n\n\u201cYou two carry on. Don\u2019t let me spoil your fun.\u201d\n\nPerplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cProblem? There\u2019s no problem,\u201d said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. \u201cNot according to you, anyway.\u201d\n\nThere were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve obviously got a problem,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSpit it out, will you?\u201d\n\nRon swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike himself.\n\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll spit it out. Don\u2019t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there\u2019s some other damn thing we\u2019ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d repeated Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\nPlunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry\u2019s jubilation: Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m not having the time of my life here,\u201d said Ron, \u201cyou know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we\u2019d been running round a few weeks, we\u2019d have achieved something.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon,\u201d Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now beating on the tent.\n\n\u201cI thought you knew what you\u2019d signed up for,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah, I thought I did too.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what part of it isn\u2019t living up to your expectations?\u201d asked Harry. Anger was coming to his defense now. \u201cDid you think we\u2019d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you\u2019d be back to Mummy by Christmas?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought you knew what you were doing!\u201d shouted Ron, standing up, and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. \u201cWe thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her.\n\n\u201cWell, sorry to let you down,\u201d said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, inadequate. \u201cI\u2019ve been straight with you from the start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in case you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019ve found one Horcrux \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and we\u2019re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them \u2014 nowhere effing near, in other words!\u201d\n\n\u201cTake off the locket, Ron,\u201d Hermione said, her voice unusually high. \u201cPlease take it off. You wouldn\u2019t be talking like this if you hadn\u2019t been wearing it all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he would,\u201d said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. \u201cD\u2019you think I haven\u2019t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D\u2019you think I didn\u2019t guess you were thinking this stuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, we weren\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie!\u201d Ron hurled at her. \u201cYou said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said you\u2019d thought he had a bit more to go on than \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say it like that \u2014 Harry, I didn\u2019t!\u201d she cried.\n\nThe rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione\u2019s face, and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew not where, and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead.\n\n\u201cSo why are you still here?\u201d Harry asked Ron.\n\n\u201cSearch me,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cGo home then,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah, maybe I will!\u201d shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s fart, do you, it\u2019s only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I\u2019ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn\u2019t care what happens to her in here \u2014 well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI was only saying \u2014 she was with the others, they were with Hagrid \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I get it, you don\u2019t care! And what about the rest of my family, \u2018the Weasleys don\u2019t need another kid injured,\u2019 did you hear that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bothered what it meant, though?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione, forcing her way between them. \u201cI don\u2019t think it means anything new has happened, anything we don\u2019t know about; think, Ron, Bill\u2019s already scarred, plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you\u2019re supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s all he meant \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won\u2019t bother myself about them. It\u2019s all right for you two, isn\u2019t it, with your parents safely out of the way \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents are dead!\u201d Harry bellowed.\n\n\u201cAnd mine could be going the same way!\u201d yelled Ron.\n\n\u201cThen GO!\u201d roared Harry. \u201cGo back to them, pretend you\u2019ve got over your spattergroit and Mummy\u2019ll be able to feed you up and \u2014\u201d\n\nRon made a sudden movement: Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner\u2019s pocket, Hermione had raised her own.\n\n\u201cProtego!\u201d she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: Something had broken between them.\n\n\u201cLeave the Horcrux,\u201d Harry said.\n\nRon wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you staying, or what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . .\u201d She looked anguished. \u201cYes \u2014 yes, I\u2019m staying. Ron, we said we\u2019d go with Harry, we said we\u2019d help \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI get it. You choose him.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, no \u2014 please \u2014 come back, come back!\u201d\n\nShe was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron\u2019s name amongst the trees.\n\nAfter a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s g-g-gone! Disapparated!\u201d\n\nShe threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry.\n\nHarry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron\u2019s bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter16": "GODRIC\u2019S HOLLOW\n\n\n\n\nWhen Harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened. Then he hoped, childishly, that it had been a dream, that Ron was still there and had never left. Yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see Ron\u2019s deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in the way it seemed to draw his eyes. Harry jumped down from his own bed, keeping his eyes averted from Ron\u2019s. Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned her face away quickly as he went by.\n\nHe\u2019s gone, Harry told himself. He\u2019s gone. He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull the shock of it. He\u2019s gone and he\u2019s not coming back. And that was the simple truth of it, Harry knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them again.\n\nHe and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione\u2019s eyes were puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, \u201cWe thought you knew what you were doing!\u201d, and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach.\n\nThe muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank. They had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite. Finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay: She and Harry grasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept heather-covered hillside.\n\nThe instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry\u2019s hand and walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the spot. Everything inside him felt cold and tight: Again he saw the contemptuous expression on Ron\u2019s face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually performed to ensure their protection.\n\nThey did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder\u2019s Map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron\u2019s labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny\u2019s name in the girls\u2019 dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right.\n\nBy day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of Gryffindor\u2019s sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what you were doing. . . . We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do. . . . We thought you had a real plan!\n\nHe could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it: The others were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends\u2019 offers to accompany him on this meandering, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indication that Hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough, that she was leaving.\n\nThey were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus\u2019s portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by Ron\u2019s departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to, and consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind. They relished any news about what was happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave his painting.\n\nHowever, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had reinstated Umbridge\u2019s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies.\n\nFrom all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore\u2019s Army. This scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Nigellus talked about Snape\u2019s crackdown, Harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of Snape\u2019s regime: Being fed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in charge, seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment. But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head, and that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about Harry and Hermione\u2019s whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious good-byes.\n\nThe weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any one area too long, so rather than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they continued to meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of a Scottish loch, where snow half buried the tent in the night.\n\nThey had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry resolved to suggest, again, what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours\u2019 break from wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him.\n\n\u201cHermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of Beedle the Bard. He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very long; but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, because Spellman\u2019s Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair.\n\nHarry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.\n\n\u201cHermione, I\u2019ve been thinking, and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, could you help me with something?\u201d\n\nApparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and held out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.\n\n\u201cLook at that symbol,\u201d she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.\n\n\u201cI never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that, but it isn\u2019t a rune and it\u2019s not in the syllabary, either. All along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don\u2019t think it is! It\u2019s been inked in, look, somebody\u2019s drawn it there, it isn\u2019t really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo . . . No, wait a moment.\u201d Harry looked closer. \u201cIsn\u2019t it the same symbol Luna\u2019s dad was wearing round his neck?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I thought too!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s Grindelwald\u2019s mark.\u201d\n\nShe stared at him, openmouthed.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cKrum told me . . .\u201d\n\nHe recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding. Hermione looked astonished.\n\n\u201cGrindelwald\u2019s mark?\u201d\n\nShe looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that Grindelwald had a mark. There\u2019s no mention of it in anything I\u2019ve ever read about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang, and Grindelwald put it there.\u201d\n\nShe fell back into the old armchair, frowning.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very odd. If it\u2019s a symbol of Dark Magic, what\u2019s it doing in a book of children\u2019s stories?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it is weird,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd you\u2019d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories have little pictures over the titles.\u201d\n\nShe did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. Harry tried again.\n\n\u201cHermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking. I \u2014 I want to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow.\u201d\n\nShe looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been wondering that too. I really think we\u2019ll have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hear me right?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOf course I did. You want to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow. I agree, I think we should. I mean, I can\u2019t think of anywhere else it could be either. It\u2019ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 what\u2019s there?\u201d asked Harry.\n\nAt that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt.\n\n\u201cWell, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you\u2019d want to go back there, and I mean, Godric\u2019s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor\u2019s birthplace \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Gryffindor came from Godric\u2019s Hollow?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm,\u201d he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months: The muscles in his face felt oddly stiff. \u201cI might\u2019ve opened it, you know, when I bought it . . . just the once. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, as the village is named after him I\u2019d have thought you might have made the connection,\u201d said Hermione. She sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late; Harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait . . .\u201d\n\nShe opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally extracting her copy of their old school textbook, A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted.\n\n\u201c\u2018Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a community. Many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical families, who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworth in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric\u2019s Hollow, the West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou and your parents aren\u2019t mentioned,\u201d Hermione said, closing the book, \u201cbecause Professor Bagshot doesn\u2019t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric\u2019s Hollow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor\u2019s sword; don\u2019t you think Dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric\u2019s Hollow. For him, the lure of the village lay in his parents\u2019 graves, the house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot.\n\n\u201cRemember what Muriel said?\u201d he asked eventually.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron\u2019s name. \u201cGinny\u2019s great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that she had sensed Ron\u2019s name in the offing. He rushed on:\n\n\u201cShe said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric\u2019s Hollow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBathilda Bagshot,\u201d murmured Hermione, running her index finger over Bathilda\u2019s embossed name on the front cover of A History of Magic. \u201cWell, I suppose \u2014\u201d\n\nShe gasped so dramatically that Harry\u2019s insides turned over; he drew his wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there was nothing there.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, half angry, half relieved. \u201cWhat did you do that for? I thought you\u2019d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, what if Bathilda\u2019s got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her?\u201d\n\nHarry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was \u201cgaga.\u201d Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on Hermione\u2019s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with Harry\u2019s dearest wish.\n\n\u201cYeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric\u2019s Hollow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but we\u2019ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.\u201d She was sitting up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we\u2019ll need to collect hair from somebody. I actually think we\u2019d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but his mind had left the conversation. For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he felt excited.\n\nHe was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. It was in Godric\u2019s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday. He could have invited friends to his house . . . He might even have had brothers and sisters . . . It would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him. After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from Hermione\u2019s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now.\n\nHarry would gladly have set out for Godric\u2019s Hollow the following day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents\u2019 deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later \u2014 once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practiced Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together \u2014 that Hermione agreed to make the journey.\n\nThey were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside pocket of Hermione\u2019s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again.\n\nHeart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in which the night\u2019s first stars were already glimmering feebly. Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village.\n\n\u201cAll this snow!\u201d Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we\u2019ll leave prints! We\u2019ll just have to get rid of them \u2014 you go in front, I\u2019ll do it \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take off the Cloak,\u201d said Harry, and when she looked frightened, \u201cOh, come on, we don\u2019t look like us and there\u2019s no one around.\u201d\n\nHe stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages: Any one of them might have been the one in which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front porches, wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever. He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, was revealed to them.\n\nStrung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-bright across the square.\n\nThe snow here had become impacted: It was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps. They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little church.\n\n\u201cHarry, I think it\u2019s Christmas Eve!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d\n\nHe had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it is,\u201d said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. \u201cThey . . . they\u2019ll be in there, won\u2019t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.\u201d\n\nHarry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling him forward. Halfway across the square, however, she stopped dead.\n\n\u201cHarry, look!\u201d\n\nShe was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had transformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother\u2019s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps.\n\nHarry drew closer, gazing up into his parents\u2019 faces. He had never imagined that there would be a statue. . . . How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on his forehead. . . .\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again toward the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war memorial.\n\nThe singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry\u2019s throat constrict, it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor, of the Great Hall\u2019s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater. . . .\n\nThere was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it. On either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows.\n\nBehind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket, Harry moved toward the nearest grave.\n\n\u201cLook at this, it\u2019s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hannah\u2019s!\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d Hermione begged him.\n\nThey waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.\n\n\u201cHarry, here!\u201d\n\nHermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his heart positively banging in his chest.\n\n\u201cIs it \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but look!\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words KENDRA DUMBLEDORE and, a short way below her dates of birth and death, AND HER DAUGHTER ARIANA. There was also a quotation:\n\nWhere your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n\n\n\nSo Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dumbledore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had died here.\n\nSeeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do.\n\nHermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died.\n\n\u201cAre you sure he never mentioned \u2014 ?\u201d Hermione began.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry curtly, then, \u201clet\u2019s keep looking,\u201d and he turned away, wishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment.\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. \u201cOh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.\u201d\n\nShe was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on her face.\n\n\u201cHarry, come back a moment.\u201d\n\nHe did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this!\u201d\n\nThe grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it.\n\n\u201cHarry, that\u2019s the mark in the book!\u201d\n\nHe peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . it could be. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone.\n\n\u201cIt says Ig \u2014 Ignotus, I think. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?\u201d Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave.\n\nEvery now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the graveyard: Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the current members had moved away from Godric\u2019s Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.\n\nThe darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. Harry looked around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had finished, that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square. Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights.\n\nThen Hermione\u2019s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few yards away.\n\n\u201cHarry, they\u2019re here . . . right here.\u201d\n\nAnd he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time: He moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs.\n\nThe headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana\u2019s. It was made of white marble, just like Dumbledore\u2019s tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it.\n\nJAMES POTTER\n\nLILY POTTER\n\n\n\nBORN 27 MARCH 1960\n\nDIED 31 OCTOBER 1981\n\nBORN 30 JANUARY 1960\n\nDIED 31 OCTOBER 1981\n\n\n\nThe last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud.\n\n\u201c\u2018The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death\u2019 . . .\u201d A horrible thought came to him, and with it a kind of panic. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, her voice gentle. \u201cIt means . . . you know . . . living beyond death. Living after death.\u201d\n\nBut they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents\u2019 moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under the snow with them.\n\nHermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could not look at her, but returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying to regain control. He should have brought something to give them, and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents\u2019 grave.\n\nAs soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not think he could stand another moment there. He put his arm around Hermione\u2019s shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore\u2019s mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter17": "BATHILDA\u2019S SECRET\n\n\n\n\nHarry, stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\nThey had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone there. Someone watching us. I can tell. There, over by the bushes.\u201d\n\nThey stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black boundary of the graveyard. Harry could not see anything.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw something move, I could have sworn I did. . . .\u201d\n\nShe broke from him to free her wand arm.\n\n\u201cWe look like Muggles,\u201d Harry pointed out.\n\n\u201cMuggles who\u2019ve just been laying flowers on your parents\u2019 grave! Harry, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone over there!\u201d\n\nHarry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted: what if \u2014 ? But then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cat,\u201d said Harry, after a second or two, \u201cor a bird. If it was a Death Eater we\u2019d be dead by now. But let\u2019s get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on.\u201d\n\nThey glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves. The pub was fuller than before: Many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the church. For a moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione murmured, \u201cLet\u2019s go this way,\u201d and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked as quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the outlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains.\n\n\u201cHow are we going to find Bathilda\u2019s house?\u201d asked Hermione, who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder. \u201cHarry? What do you think? Harry?\u201d\n\nShe tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione along with him; she slipped a little on the ice.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook. . . . Look at it, Hermione. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t . . . oh!\u201d\n\nHe could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it.\n\n\u201cI wonder why nobody\u2019s ever rebuilt it?\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cMaybe you can\u2019t rebuild it?\u201d Harry replied. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s like the injuries from Dark Magic and you can\u2019t repair the damage?\u201d\n\nHe slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of the house.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might \u2014 oh, Harry, look!\u201d\n\nHis touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front of them, up through the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in golden letters upon the wood it said:\n\nOn this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981, Lily and James Potter lost their lives. Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse. This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family.\n\n\n\nAnd all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. Some had merely signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into the wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years\u2019 worth of magical graffiti, all said similar things.\n\nGood luck, Harry, wherever you are. If you read this, Harry, we\u2019re all behind you!\n\nLong live Harry Potter.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have written on the sign!\u201d said Hermione, indignant.\n\nBut Harry beamed at her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. I\u2019m glad they did. I . . .\u201d\n\nHe broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was a woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew instinctively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them.\n\nHe did not need Hermione\u2019s pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this woman was a Muggle: She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned.\n\nHermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his.\n\n\u201cHow does she know?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street.\n\nWas it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power that he had never encountered before.\n\nFinally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump.\n\n\u201cAre you Bathilda?\u201d\n\nThe muffled figure nodded and beckoned again.\n\nBeneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod.\n\nThey stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let them pass.\n\nShe smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry\u2019s face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see.\n\nThe odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly.\n\n\u201cBathilda?\u201d Harry repeated.\n\nShe nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near?\n\nBathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room.\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m not sure about this,\u201d breathed Hermione.\n\n\u201cLook at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had to,\u201d said Harry. \u201cListen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn\u2019t all there. Muriel called her \u2018gaga.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cCome!\u201d called Bathilda from the next room.\n\nHermione jumped and clutched Harry\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room.\n\nBathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still very dark, not to mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry\u2019s nose detected, underneath the dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone bad. He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda\u2019s house to check whether she was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for she lit the candles clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire.\n\n\u201cLet me do that,\u201d offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups.\n\nThe last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-fronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered \u201cTergeo\u201d: The dust vanished from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up.\n\nIt was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on Gregorovitch\u2019s windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where he had seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were: in Rita\u2019s book.\n\n\u201cMrs. \u2014 Miss \u2014 Bagshot?\u201d he said, and his voice shook slightly. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\nBathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her.\n\n\u201cMiss Bagshot?\u201d Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest.\n\n\u201cWho is this person?\u201d Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward.\n\nShe peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry.\n\n\u201cDo you know who this is?\u201d he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. \u201cThis man? Do you know him? What\u2019s he called?\u201d\n\nBathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda\u2019s memories?\n\n\u201cWho is this man?\u201d he repeated loudly.\n\n\u201cHarry, what are you doing?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cThis picture, Hermione, it\u2019s the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!\u201d he said to Bathilda. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\nBut she only stared at him.\n\n\u201cWhy did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. \u2014 Miss \u2014 Bagshot?\u201d asked Hermione, raising her own voice. \u201cWas there something you wanted to tell us?\u201d\n\nGiving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to Harry. With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall.\n\n\u201cYou want us to leave?\u201d he asked.\n\nShe repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at herself, then at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cOh, right . . . Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Hermione, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nBut when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more pointing first at Harry, then to herself.\n\n\u201cShe wants me to go with her, alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise.\n\n\u201cMaybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really think she knows who you are?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own, \u201cI think she does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, okay then, but be quick, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cLead the way,\u201d Harry told Bathilda.\n\nShe seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him toward the door. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase. As Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the silver-framed photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket.\n\nThe stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda\u2019s backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately right, and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom.\n\nIt was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness.\n\n\u201cLumos,\u201d said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start: Bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach.\n\n\u201cYou are Potter?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\nShe nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than his own heart: It was an unpleasant, agitating sensation.\n\n\u201cHave you got anything for me?\u201d Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-tip.\n\n\u201cHave you got anything for me?\u201d he repeated.\n\nThen she closed her eyes and several things happened at once: Harry\u2019s scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice: Hold him!\n\nHarry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around him again; he did not know what had just happened.\n\n\u201cHave you got anything for me?\u201d he asked for a third time, much louder.\n\n\u201cOver here,\u201d she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window.\n\nThis time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade bed, his wand raised. He did not want to look away from her.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d she said, pointing at the shapeless mass.\n\nAnd in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been.\n\nThe snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished: Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing \u2014\n\nHe rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake\u2019s tail, which thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier: Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor. From below he heard Hermione call, \u201cHarry?\u201d\n\nHe could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular \u2014\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he gasped, pinned to the floor.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d whispered the voice. \u201cYesss . . . hold you . . . hold you . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAccio . . . Accio Wand . . .\u201d\n\nBut nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his brain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, distant footsteps, everything going. . . .\n\nA metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph in his heart, without need of broomstick or thestral. . . .\n\nHe was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light: It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Frozen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something \u2014 his wand \u2014\n\nHe bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking Harry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming! Hermione, he\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\nAs he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos: It smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be Hermione \u2014\n\nShe shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The snake reared again, but Harry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to split open with the pain from his scar \u2014\n\nThe snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, Hermione screamed, \u201cConfringo!\u201d and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair. . . .\n\nAnd then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled with the girl\u2019s, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in Christmas Day. . . .\n\nAnd his scream was Harry\u2019s scream, his pain was Harry\u2019s pain . . . that it could happen here, where it had happened before . . . here, within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing what it was to die . . . to die. . . . The pain was so terrible . . . ripped from his body. . . . But if he had no body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how could he feel so unbearably, didn\u2019t pain cease with death, didn\u2019t it go . . .\n\nThe night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square, and the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe . . . And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions. . . . Not anger . . . that was for weaker souls than he . . . but triumph, yes. . . . He had waited for this, he had hoped for it. . . .\n\n\u201cNice costume, mister!\u201d\n\nHe saw the small boy\u2019s smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face: Then the child turned and ran away . . . Beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand . . . One simple movement and the child would never reach his mother . . . but unnecessary, quite unnecessary. . . .\n\nAnd along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, the Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet. . . . And he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and stared over it. . . .\n\nThey had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist. . . .\n\nA door opened and the mother entered, saying words he could not hear, her long dark-red hair falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother. He threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning. . . .\n\nThe gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear. His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open.\n\nHe was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand. . . .\n\n\u201cLily, take Harry and go! It\u2019s him! Go! Run! I\u2019ll hold him off!\u201d\n\nHold him off, without a wand in his hand! . . . He laughed before casting the curse. . . .\n\n\u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d\n\nThe green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against the wall, it made the banisters glare like lightning rods, and James Potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut. . . .\n\nHe could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear . . . He climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in. . . . She had no wand upon her either. . . . How stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments. . . .\n\nHe forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand . . . and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead. . . .\n\n\u201cNot Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cStand aside, you silly girl . . . stand aside, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my last warning \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Harry! Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . . Not Harry! Not Harry! Please \u2014 I\u2019ll do anything \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStand aside. Stand aside, girl!\u201d\n\nHe could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them all. . . .\n\nThe green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. The child had not cried all this time: He could stand, clutching the bars of his crib, and he looked up into the intruder\u2019s face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop up any moment, laughing \u2014\n\nHe pointed the wand very carefully into the boy\u2019s face: He wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The child began to cry: It had seen that he was not James. He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage \u2014\n\n\u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d\n\nAnd then he broke: He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped and screaming, but far away . . . far away. . . .\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he moaned.\n\nThe snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy. . . .\n\n\u201cNo . . .\u201d\n\nAnd now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda\u2019s house, immersed in memories of his greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass . . . He looked down and saw something . . . something incredible. . . .\n\n\u201cNo . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, it\u2019s all right, you\u2019re all right!\u201d\n\nHe stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was, the unknown thief, the thief he was seeking. . . .\n\n\u201cNo . . . I dropped it. . . . I dropped it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, it\u2019s okay, wake up, wake up!\u201d\n\nHe was Harry. . . . Harry, not Voldemort . . . and the thing that was rustling was not a snake. . . . He opened his eyes.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cDo you feel all \u2014 all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he lied.\n\nHe was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. He could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and the quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets.\n\n\u201cWe got away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk, I couldn\u2019t lift you. You\u2019ve been . . . Well, you haven\u2019t been quite . . .\u201d\n\nThere were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand: She had been wiping his face.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been ill,\u201d she finished. \u201cQuite ill.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ago did we leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cHours ago. It\u2019s nearly morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve been . . . what, unconscious?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said Hermione uncomfortably. \u201cYou\u2019ve been shouting and moaning and . . . things,\u201d she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed curses like Voldemort, cried like the baby in the crib?\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get the Horcrux off you,\u201d Hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change the subject. \u201cIt was stuck, stuck to your chest. You\u2019ve got a mark; I\u2019m sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away. The snake bit you too, but I\u2019ve cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it. . . .\u201d\n\nHe pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. He could also see the half-healed puncture marks to his forearm.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you put the Horcrux?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.\u201d\n\nHe lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have gone to Godric\u2019s Hollow. It\u2019s my fault, it\u2019s all my fault, Hermione, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword there for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well . . . we got that wrong, didn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attack you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . . all along.\u201d\n\n\u201cW-what?\u201d\n\nHe closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda\u2019s house on him: It made the whole thing horribly vivid.\n\n\u201cBathilda must\u2019ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her. You-Know-Who put it there in Godric\u2019s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I\u2019d go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe snake was inside her?\u201d\n\nHe opened his eyes again: Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.\n\n\u201cLupin said there would be magic we\u2019d never imagined,\u201d Harry said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn\u2019t realize, but of course I could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . . and then . . .\u201d\n\nHe remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda\u2019s neck: Hermione did not need to know the details.\n\n\u201c. . . she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked.\u201d\n\nHe looked down at the puncture marks.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who came.\u201d\n\nIf he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been worth it, all of it . . . Sick at heart, he sat up and threw back the covers.\n\n\u201cHarry, no, I\u2019m sure you ought to rest!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll keep watch for a while. Where\u2019s my wand?\u201d\n\nShe did not answer, she merely looked at him.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my wand, Hermione?\u201d\n\nShe was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes.\n\n\u201cHarry . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my wand?\u201d\n\nShe reached down beside the bed and held it out to him.\n\nThe holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury. He could not think properly: Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he held out the wand to Hermione.\n\n\u201cMend it. Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, I don\u2019t think, when it\u2019s broken like this \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Hermione, try!\u201d\n\n\u201cR-Reparo.\u201d\n\nThe dangling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry held it up.\n\n\u201cLumos!\u201d\n\nThe wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at Hermione.\n\n\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble attempt at magic was too much for Harry\u2019s wand, which split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what he was seeing . . . the wand that had survived so much . . .\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have \u2014 must have hit \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an accident,\u201d said Harry mechanically. He felt empty, stunned. \u201cWe\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll find a way to repair it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to,\u201d said Hermione, the tears trickling down her face. \u201cRemember . . . remember Ron? When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It was never the same again, he had to get a new one.\u201d\n\nHarry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a new wand?\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, \u201cwell, I\u2019ll just borrow yours for now, then. While I keep watch.\u201d\n\nHer face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he left her sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter18": "THE LIFE AND LIES OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n\n\n\n\nThe sun was coming up: The pure, colorless vastness of the sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and his suffering. Harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep breath of clean air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he could not appreciate it: His senses had been spiked by the calamity of losing his wand. He looked out over a valley blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence.\n\nWithout realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he had lost all the bones in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from him. He knew exactly what Hermione would say if he expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of the twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting upon it.\n\nHe pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at them, tucked them away in Hagrid\u2019s pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and useless objects to take any more. Harry\u2019s hand brushed the old Snitch through the mokeskin and for a moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful, useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind \u2014\n\nAnd his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him inside, wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that Godric\u2019s Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore; but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he was. . . . Voldemort had all the information now. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\nHermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face streaked with tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky under her arm.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, taking one of the cups.\n\n\u201cDo you mind if I talk to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings.\n\n\u201cHarry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well . . . I\u2019ve got the book.\u201d\n\nTimidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWhere \u2014 how \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was in Bathilda\u2019s sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note was sticking out of the top of it.\u201d\n\nHermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here\u2019s a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don\u2019t remember it. Rita.\u2019 I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasn\u2019t in any fit state to read it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she probably wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHarry looked down upon Dumbledore\u2019s face and experienced a surge of savage pleasure: Now he would know all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him, whether Dumbledore wanted him to or not.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still really angry at me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNo, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible. I\u2019d be dead if you hadn\u2019t been there to help me.\u201d\n\nHe tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine was stiff; it had clearly never been opened before. He riffled through the pages, looking for photographs. He came across the one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter at some long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother\u2019s death, with his friend Gellert Grindelwald.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend Grindelwald. He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still contemplating the name as though she could not believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry.\n\n\u201cGrindelwald?\u201d\n\nIgnoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages around them for a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and read greedily, but became lost: It was necessary to go further back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of a chapter entitled \u201cThe Greater Good.\u201d Together, he and Hermione started to read:\n\nNow approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze of glory \u2014 Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal-Winner for Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias \u201cDogbreath\u201d Doge, the dim-witted but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school.\n\nThe two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, preparing to depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore\u2019s mother\u2019s death. \u201cDogbreath\u201d Doge, who refused to be interviewed for this book, has given the public his own sentimental version of what happened next. He represents Kendra\u2019s death as a tragic blow, and Dumbledore\u2019s decision to give up his expedition as an act of noble self-sacrifice.\n\nCertainly Dumbledore returned to Godric\u2019s Hollow at once, supposedly to \u201ccare\u201d for his younger brother and sister. But how much care did he actually give them?\n\n\u201cHe were a head case, that Aberforth,\u201d says Enid Smeek, whose family lived on the outskirts of Godric\u2019s Hollow at that time. \u201cRan wild. \u2019Course, with his mum and dad gone you\u2019d have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don\u2019t think Albus was fussed about him, I never saw them together, anyway.\u201d\n\nSo what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For, though her first jailer had died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her very existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders who, like \u201cDogbreath\u201d Doge, could be counted upon to believe in the story of her \u201cill health.\u201d\n\nAnother such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated magical historian who has lived in Godric\u2019s Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village. Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to Albus at Hogwarts, having been favorably impressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in Transfiguration Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family. At the time of Kendra\u2019s death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric\u2019s Hollow who was on speaking terms with Dumbledore\u2019s mother.\n\nUnfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now dimmed. \u201cThe fire\u2019s lit, but the cauldron\u2019s empty,\u201d as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek\u2019s slightly earthier phrase, \u201cShe\u2019s nutty as squirrel poo.\u201d Nevertheless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story.\n\nLike the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra\u2019s premature death down to a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her \u201cfrail\u201d and \u201cdelicate.\u201d On one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into procuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone, knows the full story of the best-kept secret of Albus Dumbledore\u2019s life. Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the oppression of Muggles, even his devotion to his own family.\n\nThe very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric\u2019s Hollow, now an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald.\n\nThe name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here.\n\nEducated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled.\n\nHitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald\u2019s next movements is that he \u201ctraveled abroad for some months.\u201d It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt in Godric\u2019s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cHe seemed a charming boy to me,\u201d babbles Bathilda, \u201cwhatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own age. The boys took to each other at once.\u201d\n\nThey certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her, that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night.\n\n\u201cYes, even after they\u2019d spent all day in discussion \u2014 both such brilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on fire \u2014 I\u2019d sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert\u2019s bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him, and he had to let Gellert know immediately!\u201d\n\nAnd what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore\u2019s fans will find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.)\n\nGellert \u2014\n\nYour point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES\u2019 OWN GOOD \u2014 this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.)\n\nAlbus\n\n\n\n\n\nAstonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this letter constitutes proof that Albus Dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the Statute of Secrecy and establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those who have always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-borns\u2019 greatest champion! How hollow those speeches promoting Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister!\n\nNo doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems altogether more shocking.\n\nBarely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore and Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again until they met for their legendary duel (for more, see chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses? Had he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans? Alas, no.\n\n\u201cIt was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,\u201d says Bathilda. \u201cIt came as an awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he came back to my house all of a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I saw of him.\n\n\u201cAlbus was beside himself at Ariana\u2019s death. It was so dreadful for those two brothers. They had lost everybody except each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dreadful circumstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus\u2019s nose at the funeral was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that, across her daughter\u2019s body. A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral. . . . He would have been a comfort to Albus, at least. . . .\u201d\n\nThis dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few who attended Ariana Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus for his sister\u2019s death? Was it, as \u201cBatty\u201d pretends, a mere effusion of grief? Or could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang for near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country hours after the girl\u2019s death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until forced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world.\n\nNeither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald. Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met?\n\nAnd how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done, as the two young men sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is it possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the first person to die \u201cfor the greater good\u201d?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom of the page before him. She tugged the book out of Harry\u2019s hands, looking a little alarmed by his expression, and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something indecent.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014\u201d\n\nBut he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside him; it was exactly as he had felt after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore, believed him the embodiment of goodness and wisdom. All was ashes: How much more could he lose? Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand . . .\n\n\u201cHarry.\u201d She seemed to have heard his thoughts. \u201cListen to me. It \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make very nice reading \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you could say that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 but don\u2019t forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I \u2014 I did.\u201d She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. \u201cI think that\u2019s the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but \u2018For the Greater Good\u2019 became Grindelwald\u2019s slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say \u2018For the Greater Good\u2019 was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Nurmengard?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s an awful thought that Dumbledore\u2019s ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can\u2019t pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that,\u201d said Harry. He did not want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady. \u201cI thought you\u2019d say \u2018They were young.\u2019 They were the same age as we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles.\u201d\n\nHis temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood up and walked around, trying to work some of it off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAll that \u2018right to rule\u2019 rubbish, it\u2019s \u2018Magic Is Might\u2019 all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck alone in the house \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAlone? He wasn\u2019t alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his Squib sister he was keeping locked up \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Hermione. She stood up too. \u201cWhatever was wrong with that girl, I don\u2019t think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have allowed \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dumbledore we thought we knew didn\u2019t want to conquer Muggles by force!\u201d Harry shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky.\n\n\u201cHe changed, Harry, he changed! It\u2019s as simple as that! Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for Muggle protection and Muggle-born rights, who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who died trying to bring him down!\u201d\n\nRita\u2019s book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both.\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m sorry, but I think the real reason you\u2019re so angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I am!\u201d Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head, hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. \u201cLook what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don\u2019t expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I\u2019m doing, trust me even though I don\u2019t trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!\u201d\n\nHis voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and the emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky.\n\n\u201cHe loved you,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cI know he loved you.\u201d\n\nHarry dropped his arms.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn\u2019t love, the mess he\u2019s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me.\u201d\n\nHarry picked up Hermione\u2019s wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the entrance of the tent.\n\n\u201cThanks for the tea. I\u2019ll finish the watch. You get back in the warm.\u201d\n\nShe hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and then walked back past him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter19": "THE SILVER DOE\n\n\n\n\nIt was snowing by the time Hermione took over the watch at midnight. Harry\u2019s dreams were confused and disturbing: Nagini wove in and out of them, first through a gigantic, cracked ring, then through a wreath of Christmas roses. He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to him in the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices.\n\nFinally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go somewhere more sheltered,\u201d she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. \u201cI kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even thought I saw somebody once or twice.\u201d\n\nHarry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I imagined it,\u201d said Hermione, looking nervous. \u201cThe snow in the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes. . . . But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?\u201d\n\nHalf an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry\u2019s feet parted company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered with leaves.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked, peering around at a fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out tent poles.\n\n\u201cThe Forest of Dean,\u201d she said. \u201cI came camping here once with my mum and dad.\u201d\n\nHere too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was so adept at producing, and which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, an impression reinforced by Hermione\u2019s solicitousness. That afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow.\n\nAfter two nights of little sleep, Harry\u2019s senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from Godric\u2019s Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more threatening. As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione\u2019s offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed.\n\nHarry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder\u2019s Map, so as to watch Ginny\u2019s dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow.\n\nEvery tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other, sinister movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should they break now? And yet he could not throw off the feeling that something was different tonight.\n\nSeveral times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and Apparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened.\n\nA bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward him.\n\nHe jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione\u2019s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still the thing came closer. . . .\n\nAnd then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver-white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high.\n\nHarry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come for him, and him alone.\n\nThey gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. \u201cCome back!\u201d\n\nShe continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her brightness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit.\n\nSnow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know.\n\nAt last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him once more, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished.\n\nThough the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear came: Her presence had meant safety.\n\n\u201cLumos!\u201d he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited.\n\nThe imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him?\n\nHe held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot?\n\nSomething gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked black surface glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it.\n\nHe moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great silver cross . . .\n\nHis heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the pool\u2019s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red . . . It was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. . . . The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.\n\nBarely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were here? In which case, where was the person who had wanted to pass it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool.\n\nHe pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, \u201cAccio Sword.\u201d\n\nIt did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy, the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help.\n\n\u201cHelp,\u201d he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless.\n\nWhat was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry\u2019s head answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart.\n\nHarry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.\n\nHe glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting.\n\nWith fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where \u201cchivalry\u201d entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.\n\nAn owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his mother\u2019s letter, the shard of Sirius\u2019s mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione\u2019s wand at the ice.\n\n\u201cDiffindo.\u201d\n\nIt cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence: The surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely.\n\nContemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. He stepped to the pool\u2019s edge and placed Hermione\u2019s wand on the ground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he jumped.\n\nEvery pore of his body screamed in protest: The very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly breathe; trembling so violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once.\n\nHarry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and shaking, until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, and dived.\n\nThe cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers closed around the hilt; he pulled it upward.\n\nThen something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised his empty hand to free himself. It was not weed: The chain of the Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe.\n\nHarry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around his chest were surely Death\u2019s. . . .\n\nChoking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere close by, another person was panting and coughing and staggering around. Hermione had come again, as she had come when the snake attacked. . . . Yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, not judging by the weight of the footsteps. . . .\n\nHarry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior\u2019s identity. All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was gone: Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head.\n\n\u201cAre \u2014 you \u2014 mental?\u201d\n\nNothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the strength to get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other.\n\n\u201cWhy the hell,\u201d panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, \u201cdidn\u2019t you take this thing off before you dived?\u201d\n\nHarry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with Ron\u2019s reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the water\u2019s edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to be real: He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cIt was y-you?\u201d Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his near-strangulation.\n\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d said Ron, looking slightly confused.\n\n\u201cY-you cast that doe?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Patronus is a stag.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.\u201d\n\nHarry put Hagrid\u2019s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione\u2019s wand, and faced Ron again.\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\nApparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve \u2014 you know \u2014 I\u2019ve come back. If \u2014\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cYou know. You still want me.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, in which the subject of Ron\u2019s departure seemed to rise like a wall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry\u2019s life.\n\nRon looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I got it out,\u201d he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for Harry\u2019s inspection. \u201cThat\u2019s why you jumped in, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. How did you get here? How did you find us?\u201d\n\n\u201cLong story,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you for hours, it\u2019s a big forest, isn\u2019t it? And I was just thinking I\u2019d have to kip under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you following.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see anyone else?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI \u2014\u201d\n\nBut he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away.\n\n\u201cI did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because you\u2019d gone in and you hadn\u2019t come up, so I wasn\u2019t going to make a detour to \u2014 hey!\u201d\n\nHarry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated. The two oaks grew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux.\n\n\u201cAnything there?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cSo how did the sword get in that pool?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.\u201d\n\nThey both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from Hermione\u2019s wand.\n\n\u201cYou reckon this is the real one?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cOne way to find out, isn\u2019t there?\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe Horcrux was still swinging from Ron\u2019s hand. The locket was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy the locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione\u2019s wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock\u2019s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head.\n\n\u201cNo, you should do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d said Ron, looking shocked. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you got the sword out of the pool. I think it\u2019s supposed to be you.\u201d\n\nHe was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to open it,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand you stab it. Straightaway, okay? Because whatever\u2019s in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the diary tried to kill me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you going to open it?\u201d asked Ron. He looked terrified.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,\u201d said Harry. The answer came so readily to his lips that he thought that he had always known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid with glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize it as a minuscule snake, curled upon the cold rock.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Ron. \u201cNo, don\u2019t open it! I\u2019m serious!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of the damn thing, it\u2019s been months \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, Harry, I\u2019m serious \u2014 you do it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause that thing\u2019s bad for me!\u201d said Ron, backing away from the locket on the rock. \u201cI can\u2019t handle it! I\u2019m not making excuses, Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affected you and Hermione, it made me think stuff \u2014 stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse, I can\u2019t explain it, and then I\u2019d take it off and I\u2019d get my head on straight again, and then I\u2019d have to put the effing thing back on \u2014 I can\u2019t do it, Harry!\u201d\n\nHe had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cYou can do it,\u201d said Harry, \u201cyou can! You\u2019ve just got the sword, I know it\u2019s supposed to be you who uses it. Please, just get rid of it, Ron.\u201d\n\nThe sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then, still breathing hard through his long nose, moved back toward the rock.\n\n\u201cTell me when,\u201d he croaked.\n\n\u201cOn three,\u201d said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry\u2019s neck still burned.\n\n\u201cOne . . . two . . . three . . . open.\u201d\n\nThe last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide with a little click.\n\nBehind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom Riddle\u2019s eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled.\n\n\u201cStab,\u201d said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock.\n\nRon raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows.\n\nThen a voice hissed from out of the Horcrux.\n\n\u201cI have seen your heart, and it is mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to it!\u201d Harry said harshly. \u201cStab it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cStab!\u201d shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cLeast loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend . . . Second best, always, eternally overshadowed . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, stab it now!\u201d Harry bellowed: He could feel the locket quivering in his grip and was scared of what was coming. Ron raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle\u2019s eyes gleamed scarlet.\n\nOut of the locket\u2019s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed, like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted.\n\nRon yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot.\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with Voldemort\u2019s voice and Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into its face.\n\n\u201cWhy return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence. . . . We laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPresumption!\u201d echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione: She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified yet transfixed, the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. \u201cWho could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, stab it, STAB IT!\u201d Harry yelled, but Ron did not move: His eyes were wide, and the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in them, their hair swirling like flames, their eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet.\n\n\u201cYour mother confessed,\u201d sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione jeered, \u201cthat she would have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,\u201d crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met.\n\nOn the ground in front of them, Ron\u2019s face filled with anguish. He raised the sword high, his arms shaking.\n\n\u201cDo it, Ron!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\nRon looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes.\n\n\u201cRon \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nThe sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way, there was a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend himself: but there was nothing to fight.\n\nThe monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone: There was only Ron, standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock.\n\nSlowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing heavily: His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue; they were also wet.\n\nHarry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle\u2019s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act.\n\nThe sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.\n\n\u201cAfter you left,\u201d he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron\u2019s face was hidden, \u201cshe cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn\u2019t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone . . .\u201d\n\nHe could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s like my sister,\u201d he went on. \u201cI love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It\u2019s always been like that. I thought you knew.\u201d\n\nRon did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron\u2019s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said in a thick voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I left. I know I was a \u2014 a \u2014\u201d\n\nHe looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him and claim him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve sort of made up for it tonight,\u201d said Harry. \u201cGetting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. Saving my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,\u201d Ron mumbled.\n\n\u201cStuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you that for years.\u201d\n\nSimultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron\u2019s jacket.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Harry as they broke apart, \u201call we\u2019ve got to do is find the tent again.\u201d\n\nBut it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with Ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him.\n\nIt was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and did not move until Harry had said her name several times.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d\n\nShe stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Harry? Are you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, everything\u2019s fine. More than fine. I\u2019m great. There\u2019s someone here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Who \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nShe saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron\u2019s rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas.\n\nHermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak, hopeful smile and half raised his arms.\n\nHermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could reach.\n\n\u201cOuch \u2014 ow \u2014 gerroff! What the \u2014 ? Hermione \u2014 OW!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 complete \u2014 arse \u2014 Ronald \u2014 Weasley!\u201d\n\nShe punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shielding his head as Hermione advanced.\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 crawl \u2014 back \u2014 here \u2014 after \u2014 weeks \u2014 and \u2014 weeks \u2014 oh, where\u2019s my wand?\u201d\n\nShe looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry\u2019s hands and he reacted instinctively.\n\n\u201cProtego!\u201d\n\nThe invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione: The force of it knocked her backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she leapt up again.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d said Harry. \u201cCalm \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not calm down!\u201d she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. \u201cGive me back my wand! Give it back to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, will you please \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!\u201d she screeched. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare! Give it back now! And YOU!\u201d\n\nShe was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a malediction, and Harry could not blame Ron for retreating several steps.\n\n\u201cI came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ron said, \u201cHermione, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re sorry!\u201d\n\nShe laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but Harry merely grimaced his helplessness.\n\n\u201cYou come back after weeks \u2014 weeks \u2014 and you think it\u2019s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what else can I say?\u201d Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know!\u201d yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. \u201cRack your brains, Ron, that should only take a couple of seconds \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, \u201che just saved my \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d she screamed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what he\u2019s done! Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for all he knew \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew you weren\u2019t dead!\u201d bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. \u201cHarry\u2019s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they\u2019re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental stories, I knew I\u2019d hear straight off if you were dead, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s been like \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat it\u2019s been like for you?\u201d\n\nHer voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his opportunity.\n\n\u201cI wanted to come back the minute I\u2019d Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn\u2019t go anywhere!\u201d\n\n\u201cA gang of what?\u201d asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for several years.\n\n\u201cSnatchers,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere \u2014 gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up Muggle-borns and blood traitors, there\u2019s a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured. I was on my own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, thought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cTold them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they believed that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t the brightest. One of them was definitely part troll, the smell off him. . . .\u201d\n\nRon glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of humor, but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs.\n\n\u201cAnyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only one of me and they\u2019d taken my wand. Then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. I didn\u2019t do it so well, Splinched myself again\u201d \u2014 Ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails; Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly \u2014 \u201cand I came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we\u2019d been . . . you\u2019d gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cGosh, what a gripping story,\u201d Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound. \u201cYou must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric\u2019s Hollow and, let\u2019s think, what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who\u2019s snake turned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and missed us by about a second.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him.\n\n\u201cImagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d said Harry quietly, \u201cRon just saved my life.\u201d\n\nShe appeared not to have heard him.\n\n\u201cOne thing I would like to know, though,\u201d she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron\u2019s head. \u201cHow exactly did you find us tonight? That\u2019s important. Once we know, we\u2019ll be able to make sure we\u2019re not visited by anyone else we don\u2019t want to see.\u201d\n\nRon glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket.\n\n\u201cThis.\u201d\n\nShe had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.\n\n\u201cThe Deluminator?\u201d she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t just turn the lights on and off,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time, because I\u2019ve been wanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard . . . I heard you.\u201d\n\nHe was looking at Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou heard me on the radio?\u201d she asked incredulously.\n\n\u201cNo, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,\u201d he held up the Deluminator again, \u201ccame out of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what exactly did I say?\u201d asked Hermione, her tone somewhere between skepticism and curiosity.\n\n\u201cMy name. \u2018Ron.\u2019 And you said . . . something about a wand. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered: It had been the first time Ron\u2019s name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left; Hermione had mentioned it when talking about repairing Harry\u2019s wand.\n\n\u201cSo I took it out,\u201d Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, \u201cand it didn\u2019t seem different or anything, but I was sure I\u2019d heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside the window.\u201d\n\nRon raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see.\n\n\u201cIt was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry and Hermione together automatically.\n\n\u201cI knew this was it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden.\n\n\u201cThe little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it . . . well, it went inside me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly.\n\n\u201cIt sort of floated toward me,\u201d said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, \u201cright to my chest, and then \u2014 it just went straight through. It was here,\u201d he touched a point close to his heart, \u201cI could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me I knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill. There was snow everywhere. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were there,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, that would\u2019ve been me,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYour protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn\u2019t see you and I couldn\u2019t hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you\u2019d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, actually,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe\u2019ve been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early, because, as Harry says, we\u2019d heard somebody blundering around.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I stayed on that hill all day,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI kept hoping you\u2019d appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn\u2019t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end \u2014 and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw the what?\u201d said Hermione sharply.\n\nThey explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together.\n\n\u201cBut it must have been a Patronus!\u201d she said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you see who was casting it? Didn\u2019t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can\u2019t believe this! Then what happened?\u201d\n\nRon explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool and had waited for him to resurface; how he had realized that something was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, then returned for the sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and Harry cut in.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and Ron stabbed it with the sword.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd . . . and it went? Just like that?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cWell, it \u2014 it screamed,\u201d said Harry with half a glance at Ron. \u201cHere.\u201d\n\nHe threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows.\n\nDeciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione\u2019s wand and turned to Ron.\n\n\u201cDid you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. \u201cOh \u2014 oh yeah.\u201d\n\nHe tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short, dark wand out of its pocket. \u201cHere. I figured it\u2019s always handy to have a backup.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were right,\u201d said Harry, holding out his hand. \u201cMine\u2019s broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked apprehensive again.\n\nHermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another word.\n\nRon passed Harry the new wand.\n\n\u201cAbout the best you could hope for, I think,\u201d murmured Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCould\u2019ve been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI still haven\u2019t ruled it out,\u201d came Hermione\u2019s muffled voice from beneath her blankets, but Harry saw Ron smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out of his rucksack."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter20": "XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD\n\n\n\n\nHarry had not expected Hermione\u2019s anger to abate overnight, and was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty looks and pointed silences the next morning. Ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse. In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became shamelessly cheery.\n\n\u201cSomeone helped us,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cSomeone sent that doe. Someone\u2019s on our side. One Horcrux down, mate!\u201d\n\nBolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione\u2019s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor\u2019s sword, and above all, Ron\u2019s return, made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.\n\nLate in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione\u2019s baleful presence again, and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione\u2019s various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric\u2019s Hollow; Ron was now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during his weeks away.\n\n\u201c. . . and how did you find out about the Taboo?\u201d he asked Harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry.\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who\u2019s name!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. Well, it\u2019s just a bad habit we\u2019ve slipped into,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t got a problem calling him V \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. \u201cSorry,\u201d said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, \u201cbut the name\u2019s been jinxed, Harry, that\u2019s how they track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance \u2014 it\u2019s how they found us in Tottenham Court Road!\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we used his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly! You\u2019ve got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who ever dared use it. Now they\u2019ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable \u2014 quick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got Kingsley \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his way out. He\u2019s on the run now, just like us.\u201d Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. \u201cYou don\u2019t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah . . .\u201d\n\nThey moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione.\n\n\u201cHarry . . . you don\u2019t reckon it could\u2019ve been Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore what?\u201d\n\nRon looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, \u201cDumbledore . . . the doe? I mean,\u201d Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, \u201che had the real sword last, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nHarry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, would have been inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head.\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw it happen, I saw the body. He\u2019s definitely gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatronuses can change, though, can\u2019t they?\u201d said Ron. \u201cTonks\u2019s changed, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn\u2019t he show himself? Why wouldn\u2019t he just hand us the sword?\u201d\n\n\u201cSearch me,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSame reason he didn\u2019t give it to you while he was alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids\u2019 stories?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is what?\u201d asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face, desperate for the answer.\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ve thought, when I\u2019ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or \u2014 or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don\u2019t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn\u2019t he? He \u2014 well,\u201d Ron\u2019s ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe, \u201che must\u2019ve known I\u2019d run out on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry corrected him. \u201cHe must\u2019ve known you\u2019d always want to come back.\u201d\n\nRon looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry said, \u201cSpeaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Ron at once, \u201cpeople are talking about it quite a lot. \u2019Course, if things were different, it\u2019d be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it\u2019s just something to laugh about for people who didn\u2019t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s such a big deal, though. He was really young when they \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOur age,\u201d said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject.\n\nA large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of blackthorn.\n\n\u201cEngorgio.\u201d\n\nThe spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger.\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d said Ron sharply. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay?\u201d\n\nHarry had forgotten Ron\u2019s hatred of spiders.\n\n\u201cSorry \u2014 Reducio.\u201d\n\nThe spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else\u2019s hand sewn to the end of his arm.\n\n\u201cYou just need to practice,\u201d said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. \u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of confidence, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more.\n\nAll three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this one program,\u201d he told Harry in a low voice, \u201cthat tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who\u2019s side and are following the Ministry line, but this one . . . you wait till you hear it, it\u2019s great. Only they can\u2019t do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they\u2019re raided, and you need a password to tune in. . . . Trouble is, I missed the last one. . . .\u201d\n\nHe drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand, muttering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand.\n\nFinally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s annoying you, I\u2019ll stop!\u201d he told Hermione nervously.\n\nHermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she said.\n\nHe looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita\u2019s version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione\u2019s answer, however, was completely unexpected.\n\n\u201cI want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cXenophilius Lovegood. Luna\u2019s father. I want to go and talk to him!\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 why?\u201d\n\nShe took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s that mark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!\u201d\n\nShe thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry\u2019s unwilling eyes and he saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore\u2019s familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Rita\u2019s invention.\n\n\u201cThe signature,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cLook at the signature, Harry!\u201d\n\nHe obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 what are you \u2014 ?\u201d said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry.\n\n\u201cIt keeps cropping up, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cI know Viktor said it was Grindelwald\u2019s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric\u2019s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can\u2019t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means \u2014 I don\u2019t even know whether Grindelwald\u2019s still alive \u2014 but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I\u2019m sure this is important, Harry!\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, \u201cHermione, we don\u2019t need another Godric\u2019s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you know we\u2019re not supposed to find out about the sign?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we go again!\u201d Harry felt slightly exasperated. \u201cWe keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,\u201d piped up Ron. \u201cI think Hermione\u2019s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.\u201d\n\nHarry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron\u2019s support of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be like Godric\u2019s Hollow,\u201d Ron added, \u201cLovegood\u2019s on your side, Harry, The Quibbler\u2019s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they\u2019ve got to help you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure this is important!\u201d said Hermione earnestly.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe . . . maybe it\u2019s something you need to find out for yourself,\u201d said Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron sycophantically, \u201cthat makes sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d snapped Hermione, \u201cbut I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric\u2019s Hollow? Harry, I\u2019m sure we ought to know about this!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we should vote on it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThose in favor of going to see Lovegood \u2014\u201d\n\nHis hand flew into the air before Hermione\u2019s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own.\n\n\u201cOutvoted, Harry, sorry,\u201d said Ron, clapping him on the back.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Harry, half amused, half irritated. \u201cOnly, once we\u2019ve seen Lovegood, let\u2019s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegoods live, anyway? Do either of you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re not far from my place,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn\u2019t be hard to find.\u201d\n\nWhen Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice.\n\n\u201cYou only agreed to try and get back in her good books.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll\u2019s fair in love and war,\u201d said Ron brightly, \u201cand this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it\u2019s the Christmas holidays, Luna\u2019ll be home!\u201d\n\nThey had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchpole from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,\u201d said Hermione coldly.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t at the Burrow!\u201d said Ron with an incredulous laugh. \u201cDo you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I\u2019d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would\u2019ve been great about it. And Ginny, she\u2019d have been really understanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where have you been, then?\u201d asked Hermione, surprised.\n\n\u201cBill and Fleur\u2019s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill\u2019s always been decent to me. He \u2014 he wasn\u2019t impressed when he heard what I\u2019d done, but he didn\u2019t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry. None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren\u2019t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after they were married. I don\u2019t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.\u201d\n\nRon turned his back on the Burrow.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try up here,\u201d he said, leading the way over the top of the hill.\n\nThey walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione\u2019s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which seemed deserted.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s theirs, and they\u2019ve gone away for Christmas?\u201d said Hermione, peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. Ron snorted.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019ve got a feeling you\u2019d be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the Lovegoods\u2019 window. Let\u2019s try the next lot of hills.\u201d\n\nSo they Disapparated a few miles farther north.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be Luna\u2019s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like a bird,\u201d said Hermione, frowning at the tower.\n\n\u201cI was talking about a chess rook,\u201d said Ron. \u201cA castle to you.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s theirs,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\nThree hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down gate. The first read,\n\nTHE QUIBBLER. EDITOR: X. LOVEGOOD\n\n\n\nthe second,\n\nPICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE\n\n\n\nthe third,\n\nKEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS\n\n\n\nThe gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in the orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened, hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us.\u201d\n\nHe did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She then rapped three times on the thick black door, which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle.\n\nBarely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur\u2019s wedding by comparison.\n\n\u201cWhat? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?\u201d he cried in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical O.\n\n\u201cHello, Mr. Lovegood,\u201d said Harry, holding out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Harry, Harry Potter.\u201d\n\nXenophilius did not take Harry\u2019s hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cWould it be okay if we came in?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cThere\u2019s something we\u2019d like to ask you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s advisable,\u201d whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. \u201cRather a shock . . . My word . . . I . . . I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t really think I ought to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t take long,\u201d said Harry, slightly disappointed by this less-than-warm welcome.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!\u201d\n\nThey were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them. They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that it felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls \u2014 the stove, the sink, and the cupboards \u2014 and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he recognized Luna\u2019s style: The effect, in such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming.\n\nIn the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better come up,\u201d said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the way.\n\nThe room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling.\n\nLuna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves, but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the fact that it was churning out Quibblers.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized a grubby tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.\n\n\u201cWhy have you come here?\u201d\n\nBefore Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of shock.\n\n\u201cMr. Lovegood \u2014 what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nShe was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room.\n\n\u201cIt is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,\u201d said Xenophilius.\n\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d muttered Harry, embarrassed, \u201cnow\u2019s not the moment \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry, it\u2019s an Erumpent horn! It\u2019s a Class B Tradeable Material and it\u2019s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know it\u2019s an Erumpent horn?\u201d asked Ron, edging away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don\u2019t you know it can explode at the slightest touch?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Crumple-Horned Snorkack,\u201d said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, \u201cis a shy and highly magical creature, and its horn \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that\u2019s an Erumpent horn and it\u2019s incredibly dangerous \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you got it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI bought it,\u201d said Xenophilius dogmatically, \u201ctwo weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,\u201d he said, turning to Harry, \u201cwhy exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need some help,\u201d said Harry, before Hermione could start again.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Xenophilius. \u201cHelp. Hmm.\u201d\n\nHis good eye moved again to Harry\u2019s scar. He seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized.\n\n\u201cYes. The thing is . . . helping Harry Potter . . . rather dangerous . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who keeps telling everyone it\u2019s their first duty to help Harry?\u201d said Ron. \u201cIn that magazine of yours?\u201d\n\nXenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes, I have expressed that view. However \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for everyone else to do, not you personally?\u201d said Ron.\n\nXenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Luna?\u201d asked Hermione. \u201cLet\u2019s see what she thinks.\u201d\n\nXenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, \u201cLuna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She . . . she will like to see you. I\u2019ll go and call her and then \u2014 yes, very well. I shall try to help you.\u201d\n\nHe disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door open and close. They looked at each other.\n\n\u201cCowardly old wart,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLuna\u2019s got ten times his guts.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably worried about what\u2019ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I agree with Ron,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAwful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven\u2019s sake keep away from that horn.\u201d\n\nHarry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they had been since Bill and Fleur\u2019s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius\u2019s attitude proved that.\n\nHe turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead.\n\n\u201cLook at this,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFetching,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSurprised he didn\u2019t wear that to the wedding.\u201d\n\nThey heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot.\n\n\u201cAh, you have spotted my pet invention,\u201d he said, shoving the tray into Hermione\u2019s arms and joining Harry at the statue\u2019s side. \u201cModeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw. \u2018Wit beyond measure is man\u2019s greatest treasure!\u2019\u201d\n\nHe indicated the objects like ear trumpets.\n\n\u201cThese are the Wrackspurt siphons \u2014 to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker\u2019s immediate area. Here,\u201d he pointed out the tiny wings, \u201ca billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally,\u201d he pointed to the orange radish, \u201cthe Dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.\u201d\n\nXenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables.\n\n\u201cMay I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?\u201d said Xenophilius. \u201cWe make it ourselves.\u201d As he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice, he added, \u201cLuna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not to be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plimpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, \u201chow may I help you, Mr. Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly, \u201cit\u2019s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur\u2019s wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.\u201d\n\nXenophilius raised his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cAre you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?\u201d"}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter21": "THE TALE OF THE THREE BROTHERS\n\n\n\n\nHarry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither of them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius had said either.\n\n\u201cThe Deathly Hallows?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Xenophilius. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard of them? I\u2019m not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckleheaded young man at your brother\u2019s wedding,\u201d he nodded at Ron, \u201cwho attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows \u2014 at least, not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.\u201d\n\nHe stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI still don\u2019t really understand.\u201d\n\nTo be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged: The stuff was quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans.\n\n\u201cWell, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,\u201d said Xenophilius, smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion.\n\n\u201cBut what are the Deathly Hallows?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\nXenophilius set aside his empty teacup.\n\n\u201cI assume that you are all familiar with \u2018The Tale of the Three Brothers\u2019?\u201d\n\nHarry said, \u201cNo,\u201d but Ron and Hermione both said, \u201cYes.\u201d Xenophilius nodded gravely.\n\n\u201cWell, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with \u2018The Tale of the Three Brothers\u2019 . . . I have a copy somewhere. . . .\u201d\n\nHe glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I\u2019ve got it right here.\u201d\n\nAnd she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag.\n\n\u201cThe original?\u201d inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, \u201cWell then, why don\u2019t you read it aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . all right,\u201d said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read.\n\n\u201c\u2018There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMidnight, our mum always told us,\u201d said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance.\n\n\u201cSorry, I just think it\u2019s a bit spookier if it\u2019s midnight!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,\u201d said Harry before he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the sky. \u201cGo on, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.\n\n\u201c\u2018And Death spoke to them \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d interjected Harry, \u201cbut Death spoke to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairy tale, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, sorry. Go on.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.\n\n\u201c\u2018So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother.\n\n\u201c\u2018Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.\n\n\u201c\u2018And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath\u2019s got an Invisibility Cloak?\u201d Harry interrupted again.\n\n\u201cSo he can sneak up on people,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Death\u2019s gifts.\n\n\u201c\u2018In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.\n\n\u201c\u2018The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.\n\n\u201c\u2018That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother\u2019s throat.\n\n\u201c\u2018And so Death took the first brother for his own.\n\n\u201c\u2018Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.\n\n\u201c\u2018Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her.\n\n\u201c\u2018And so Death took the second brother for his own.\n\n\u201c\u2018But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.\u2019\u201d\n\nHermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, \u201cWell, there you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d said Hermione, sounding confused.\n\n\u201cThose are the Deathly Hallows,\u201d said Xenophilius.\n\nHe picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books.\n\n\u201cThe Elder Wand,\u201d he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. \u201cThe Resurrection Stone,\u201d he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. \u201cThe Cloak of Invisibility,\u201d he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. \u201cTogether,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Deathly Hallows.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no mention of the words \u2018Deathly Hallows\u2019 in the story,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, of course not,\u201d said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. \u201cThat is a children\u2019s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.\u201d\n\nThere was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low in the sky.\n\n\u201cLuna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,\u201d he said quietly.\n\n\u201cWhen you say \u2018master of Death\u2019 \u2014\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cMaster,\u201d said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. \u201cConqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then . . . do you mean . . .\u201d said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, \u201cthat you believe these objects \u2014 these Hallows \u2014 actually exist?\u201d\n\nXenophilius raised his eyebrows again.\n\n\u201cWell, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, \u201cMr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cLuna has told me all about you, young lady,\u201d said Xenophilius. \u201cYou are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,\u201d said Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing.\n\n\u201cMr. Lovegood,\u201d Hermione began again. \u201cWe all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?\u201d\n\nHermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. \u201cNone of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?\u201d\n\nHe glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Hermione, disconcerted. \u201cSay the Cloak existed . . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, how can that be real?\u201d\n\n\u201cProve that it is not,\u201d said Xenophilius.\n\nHermione looked outraged.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn\u2019t exist? Do you expect me to get hold of \u2014 of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you could claim that anything\u2019s real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody\u2019s proved it doesn\u2019t exist!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you could,\u201d said Xenophilius. \u201cI am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the Elder Wand,\u201d said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, \u201cyou think that exists too?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,\u201d said Xenophilius. \u201cThe Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is what?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cWhich is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly master of it,\u201d said Xenophilius. \u201cSurely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him.\n\n\u201cSo where do you think the Elder Wand is now?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cAlas, who knows?\u201d said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. \u201cWho knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, \u201cMr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?\u201d\n\nXenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry\u2019s memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell . . . he had heard that name before. . . .\n\n\u201cBut you have been misleading me, young woman!\u201d said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. \u201cI thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything \u2014 everything! \u2014 to do with the Hallows!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are the Peverells?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cThat was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric\u2019s Hollow,\u201d said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. \u201cIgnotus Peverell.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. \u201cThe sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus\u2019s grave is conclusive proof!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cWhy, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!\u201d\n\nWith another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase.\n\n\u201cYou will stay for dinner?\u201d he called, as he vanished downstairs again. \u201cEverybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo\u2019s,\u201d said Ron under his breath.\n\nHarry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry,\u201d she said wearily, \u201cit\u2019s a pile of utter rubbish. This can\u2019t be what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it either?\u201d Harry asked him.\n\n\u201cNah, that story\u2019s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn\u2019t it? \u2018Don\u2019t go looking for trouble, don\u2019t pick fights, don\u2019t go messing around with stuff that\u2019s best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you\u2019ll be okay.\u2019 Come to think of it,\u201d Ron added, \u201cmaybe that story\u2019s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of those superstitions, isn\u2019t it? \u2018May-born witches will marry Muggles.\u2019 \u2018Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.\u2019 \u2018Wand of elder, never prosper.\u2019 You must\u2019ve heard them. My mum\u2019s full of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry and I were raised by Muggles,\u201d Hermione reminded him. \u201cWe were taught different superstitions.\u201d She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. \u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a morality tale, it\u2019s obvious which gift is best, which one you\u2019d choose \u2014\u201d\n\nThe three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, \u201cthe Cloak,\u201d Ron said, \u201cthe wand,\u201d and Harry said, \u201cthe stone.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say the Cloak,\u201d Ron told Hermione, \u201cbut you wouldn\u2019t need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWhereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if you shouted about it,\u201d argued Ron. \u201cOnly if you were prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and singing, \u2018I\u2019ve got an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you think you\u2019re hard enough.\u2019 As long as you kept your trap shut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but could you keep your trap shut?\u201d said Hermione, looking skeptical. \u201cYou know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have?\u201d asked Harry.\n\nHermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other.\n\n\u201cThe Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who\u2019s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but \u2014 oh, it\u2019s all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do you know,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat those wands \u2014 the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny \u2014 aren\u2019t the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, and they\u2019re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHarry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. And if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken?\n\n\u201cSo why would you take the stone?\u201d Ron asked him.\n\n\u201cWell, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius . . . Mad-Eye . . . Dumbledore . . . my parents. . . .\u201d\n\nNeither Ron nor Hermione smiled.\n\n\u201cBut according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn\u2019t want to come back, would they?\u201d said Harry, thinking about the tale they had just heard. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?\u201d he asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that\u2019s possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.\u201d\n\nThe smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It was something like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings.\n\n\u201cWhat about the Cloak, though?\u201d said Ron slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize, he\u2019s right? I\u2019ve got so used to Harry\u2019s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I\u2019ve never heard of one like Harry\u2019s. It\u2019s infallible. We\u2019ve never been spotted under it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not \u2014 we\u2019re invisible when we\u2019re under it, Ron!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they\u2019re not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It\u2019s never occurred to me before, but I\u2019ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they\u2019ve got holes in. Harry\u2019s was owned by his dad, so it\u2019s not exactly new, is it, but it\u2019s just . . . perfect!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, all right, but Ron, the stone . . .\u201d\n\nAs they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above.\n\nAfter a moment\u2019s bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs.\n\n\u201cHarry, what are you doing? I don\u2019t think you should look around when he\u2019s not here!\u201d\n\nBut Harry had already reached the next level.\n\nLuna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same: Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one word, repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends . . . friends . . . friends . . .\n\nHarry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around.\n\nSomething was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest window, across a bloodred sky.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls.\n\n\u201cMr. Lovegood,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhere\u2019s Luna?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Luna?\u201d\n\nXenophilius halted on the top step.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I\u2019ve already told you. She is down at Bottom Bridge, fishing for Plimpies.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why have you only laid that tray for four?\u201d\n\nXenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius\u2019s hands shook.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Luna\u2019s been here for weeks,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHer clothes are gone, her bed hasn\u2019t been slept in. Where is she? And why do you keep looking out of the window?\u201d\n\nXenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth; the press fell silent at last.\n\nHermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood.\n\n\u201cHarry, look at this.\u201d\n\nHe strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE and captioned with the reward money.\n\n\u201cThe Quibbler\u2019s going for a new angle, then?\u201d Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast. \u201cIs that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry?\u201d\n\nXenophilius licked his lips.\n\n\u201cThey took my Luna,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBecause of what I\u2019ve been writing. They took my Luna and I don\u2019t know where she is, what they\u2019ve done to her. But they might give her back to me if I \u2014 if I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHand over Harry?\u201d Hermione finished for him.\n\n\u201cNo deal,\u201d said Ron flatly. \u201cGet out of the way, we\u2019re leaving.\u201d\n\nXenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer.\n\n\u201cThey will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.\u201d\n\nHe spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make us hurt you,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGet out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.\u201d\n\n\u201cHARRY!\u201d Hermione screamed.\n\nFigures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm\u2019s way as Xenophilius\u2019s Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn.\n\nThere was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart: Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Hermione\u2019s scream, Ron\u2019s yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs.\n\nHalf buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fallen in, and the end of Luna\u2019s bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger to her lips.\n\nThe door downstairs crashed open.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?\u201d said a rough voice. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?\u201d\n\nThere was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius.\n\n\u201cNo . . . no . . . upstairs . . . Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you last week, Lovegood, we weren\u2019t coming back for anything less than some solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before\u201d \u2014 another bang, another squeal \u2014 \u201cwhen you thought we\u2019d give her back if you offered us proof there are Crumple\u201d \u2014 bang \u2014 \u201cHeaded\u201d \u2014 bang \u2014 \u201cSnorkacks?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no \u2014 I beg you!\u201d sobbed Xenophilius. \u201cIt really is Potter! Really!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!\u201d roared the Death Eater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius.\n\n\u201cThe place looks like it\u2019s about to fall in, Selwyn,\u201d said a cool second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase. \u201cThe stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might bring the place down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou lying piece of filth,\u201d shouted the wizard named Selwyn. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you\u2019d lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you\u2019ll get your girl back like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear . . . I swear . . . Potter\u2019s upstairs!\u201d\n\n\u201cHomenum revelio,\u201d said the voice at the foot of the stairs.\n\nHarry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone up there all right, Selwyn,\u201d said the second man sharply.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Potter, I tell you, it\u2019s Potter!\u201d sobbed Xenophilius. \u201cPlease . . . please . . . give me Luna, just let me have Luna. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can have your little girl, Lovegood,\u201d said Selwyn, \u201cif you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it\u2019s a trick, if you\u2019ve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we\u2019ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.\u201d\n\nXenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Harry whispered, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u201d\n\nHe started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius\u2019s banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. \u201cDo you trust me, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d Hermione whispered, \u201cgive me the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, you\u2019re going to put it on.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe? But Harry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my shoulder.\u201d\n\nHarry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know what Hermione was waiting for.\n\n\u201cHold tight,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHold tight . . . any second . . .\u201d\n\nXenophilius\u2019s paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard.\n\n\u201cObliviate!\u201d cried Hermione, pointing her wand first into his face, then at the floor beneath them. \u201cDeprimo!\u201d\n\nShe had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry\u2019s ears as she dragged him once more into darkness."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter22": "THE DEATHLY HALLOWS\n\n\n\n\nHarry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed to have landed in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around them, waving her wand.\n\n\u201cProtego Totalum . . . Salvio Hexia . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat treacherous old bleeder!\u201d Ron panted, emerging from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. \u201cHermione, you\u2019re a genius, a total genius, I can\u2019t believe we got out of that!\u201d\n\n\u201cCave Inimicum . . . Didn\u2019t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn\u2019t I tell him? And now his house has been blown apart!\u201d\n\n\u201cServes him right,\u201d said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs. \u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon they\u2019ll do to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I hope they don\u2019t kill him!\u201d groaned Hermione. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn\u2019t been lying!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy hide me, though?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be in bed with spattergroit, Ron! They\u2019ve kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you\u2019re with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about your mum and dad?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in Australia,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThey should be all right. They don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d Ron repeated, looking awed.\n\n\u201cYeah, you are, Hermione,\u201d agreed Harry fervently. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do without you.\u201d\n\nShe beamed, but became solemn at once.\n\n\u201cWhat about Luna?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if they\u2019re telling the truth and she\u2019s still alive \u2014\u201d began Ron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that, don\u2019t say it!\u201d squealed Hermione. \u201cShe must be alive, she must!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen she\u2019ll be in Azkaban, I expect,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhether she survives the place, though . . . Loads don\u2019t. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will,\u201d said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. \u201cShe\u2019s tough, Luna, much tougher than you\u2019d think. She\u2019s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 if he hadn\u2019t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThey put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly.\n\n\u201cOh, why did we go there?\u201d groaned Hermione after a few minutes\u2019 silence. \u201cHarry, you were right, it was Godric\u2019s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows . . . such rubbish . . . although actually,\u201d a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, \u201che might have made it all up, mightn\u2019t he? He probably doesn\u2019t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you\u2019re under stress than you\u2019d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t suppose it matters,\u201d sighed Hermione. \u201cEven if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on, though,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the Deathly Hallows can\u2019t exist, Ron!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep saying that, but one of them can,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry\u2019s Invisibility Cloak \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018The Tale of the Three Brothers\u2019 is a story,\u201d said Hermione firmly. \u201cA story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we\u2019d have everything we need already!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,\u201d said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said there have been loads of wands \u2014 the Deathstick and whatever they were called \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand\u2019s real, what about the Resurrection Stone?\u201d Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. \u201cNo magic can raise the dead, and that\u2019s that!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my wand connected with You-Know-Who\u2019s, it made my mum and dad appear . . . and Cedric . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they weren\u2019t really back from the dead, were they?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThose kinds of \u2014 of pale imitations aren\u2019t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she, the girl in the tale, didn\u2019t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn\u2019t he? He even lived with her for a while. . . .\u201d\n\nHe saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione\u2019s expression. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people.\n\n\u201cSo that Peverell bloke who\u2019s buried in Godric\u2019s Hollow,\u201d he said hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, \u201cyou don\u2019t know anything about him, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. \u201cI looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he\u2019d been anyone famous or done anything important, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be in one of our books. The only place I\u2019ve managed to find the name \u2018Peverell\u2019 is Nature\u2019s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,\u201d she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. \u201cIt lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Extinct in the male line\u2019?\u201d repeated Ron.\n\n\u201cIt means the name\u2019s died out,\u201d said Hermione, \u201ccenturies ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they\u2019d just be called something different.\u201d\n\nAnd then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name \u201cPeverell\u201d: a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, \u201cMarvolo Gaunt!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d said Ron and Hermione together.\n\n\u201cMarvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who\u2019s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione looked bewildered.\n\n\u201cThe ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry\u2019s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Peverell coat of arms?\u201d said Hermione sharply. \u201cCould you see what it looked like?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Harry, trying to remember. \u201cThere was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.\u201d\n\nHarry saw Hermione\u2019s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished.\n\n\u201cBlimey . . . You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Harry excitedly. \u201cMarvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn\u2019t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He\u2019d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes . . . and that\u2019s all very interesting,\u201d said Hermione cautiously, \u201cbut Harry, if you\u2019re thinking what I think you\u2019re think \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why not? Why not?\u201d said Harry, abandoning caution. \u201cIt was a stone, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d He looked at Ron for support. \u201cWhat if it was the Resurrection Stone?\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s mouth fell open.\n\n\u201cBlimey \u2014 but would it still work if Dumbledore broke \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWork? Work? Ron, it never worked! There\u2019s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!\u201d\n\nHermione had leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. \u201cHarry, you\u2019re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFit everything in?\u201d he repeated. \u201cHermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!\u201d\n\n\u201cA minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere d\u2019you reckon the ring is now?\u201d Ron asked Harry. \u201cWhat did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?\u201d\n\nBut Harry\u2019s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione\u2019s. . . .\n\nThree objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death . . . Master . . . Conqueror . . . Vanquisher . . . The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. . . .\n\nAnd he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no match . . . Neither can live while the other survives. . . . Was this the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way, after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe?\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\nBut he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. . . .\n\nAnd then, with a gasp, he remembered \u2014\n\n\u201cDumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!\u201d\n\nHis voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care.\n\n\u201cMy mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric\u2019s Hollow. . . .\u201d Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. \u201cHe\u2019s my ancestor! I\u2019m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!\u201d\n\nHe felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard.\n\n\u201cRead it,\u201d he told her, pushing his mother\u2019s letter into her hand. \u201cRead it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn\u2019t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!\u201d\n\nSomething fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out.\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S IN HERE! He left me the ring \u2014 it\u2019s in the Snitch!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 you reckon?\u201d\n\nHe could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry: Everything fit, everything . . . His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then \u2014\n\nBut it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s after.\u201d\n\nThe change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared.\n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who\u2019s after the Elder Wand.\u201d\n\nHe turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made sense. Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the night, thinking. . . .\n\nVoldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them?\n\nHarry gazed into the darkness. . . . If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn\u2019t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret?\n\nWhich meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of three . . . for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, whose existence was best known. . . . The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history . . .\n\nHarry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries.\n\nHe turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily\u2019s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn\u2019t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes?\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty. \u201cThis explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real, and I\u2019ve got one \u2014 maybe two \u2014\u201d\n\nHe held up the Snitch.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and You-Know-Who\u2019s chasing the third, but he doesn\u2019t realize . . . he just thinks it\u2019s a powerful wand \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily\u2019s letter, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I think you\u2019ve got this wrong, all wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you see? It all fits \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t, Harry, you\u2019re just getting carried away. Please,\u201d she said as he started to speak, \u201cplease just answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all three of them would be master of Death \u2014 Harry, why wouldn\u2019t he have told you? Why?\u201d\n\nHe had his answer ready.\n\n\u201cBut you said it, Hermione! You\u2019ve got to find out about them for yourself! It\u2019s a Quest!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods\u2019!\u201d cried Hermione in exasperation. \u201cI didn\u2019t really believe it!\u201d\n\nHarry took no notice.\n\n\u201cDumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he\u2019d do.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, this isn\u2019t a game, this isn\u2019t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn\u2019t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can\u2019t afford to get sidetracked \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real.\n\nShe appealed to Ron.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in this, do you?\u201d\n\nHarry looked up. Ron hesitated.\n\n\u201cI dunno . . . I mean . . . bits of it sort of fit together,\u201d said Ron awkwardly. \u201cBut when you look at the whole thing . . .\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI think we\u2019re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That\u2019s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe . . . maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Ron,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI\u2019ll take first watch.\u201d\n\nAnd she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance, bringing the action to a fierce full stop.\n\nBut Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all. . . .\n\nI open at the close. . . . But what was \u2018the close\u2019? Why couldn\u2019t he have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person . . . and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open. . . .\n\nAnd the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort\u2019s thoughts, because for the first time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing. . . . Hermione would not like that idea, of course. . . . But then, she did not believe . . . Xenophilius had been right, in a way . . . Limited. Narrow. Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the Resurrection Stone . . . and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly swallowing it, but the cold metal did not yield. . . .\n\nIt was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her; but dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not yet tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand. . . . He must try that in the morning. . . .\n\nIf only there was a way of getting a better wand . . .\n\nAnd desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once more. . . .\n\nThey packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione\u2019s flat disbelief nor Ron\u2019s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry\u2019s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes.\n\n\u201cObsession?\u201d said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. \u201cWe\u2019re not the ones with an obsession, Harry! We\u2019re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!\u201d\n\nBut he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives . . . master of Death . . . Why didn\u2019t Ron and Hermione understand?\n\n\u201c\u2018The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,\u2019\u201d Harry quoted calmly.\n\n\u201cI thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?\u201d Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her.\n\nEven the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand\u2019s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort\u2019s mind as well as before.\n\nAs the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harry\u2019s descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action.\n\n\u201cThree Horcruxes left,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cWe need a plan of action, come on! Where haven\u2019t we looked? Let\u2019s go through it again. The orphanage . . .\u201d\n\nDiagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort\u2019s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving.\n\n\u201cYou never know,\u201d was Ron\u2019s constant refrain. \u201cUpper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might\u2019ve wanted to live there. Let\u2019s go and have a poke around.\u201d\n\nThese frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of Snatchers.\n\n\u201cSome of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill reckons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOn what?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cPotterwatch, didn\u2019t I tell you that\u2019s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what\u2019s going on! Nearly all the programs are following You-Know-Who\u2019s line, all except Potterwatch. I really want you to hear it, but it\u2019s tricky tuning in. . . .\u201d\n\nRon spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragon pox, and once a few bars of \u201cA Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love.\u201d While he tapped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his breath.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re normally something to do with the Order,\u201d he told them. \u201cBill had a real knack for guessing them. I\u2019m bound to get one in the end. . . .\u201d\n\nBut not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it, I\u2019ve got it! Password was \u2018Albus\u2019! Get in here, Harry!\u201d\n\nRoused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing.\n\n\u201c. . . apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s Lee Jordan!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d beamed Ron. \u201cCool, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . now found ourselves another secure location,\u201d Lee was saying, \u201cand I\u2019m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!\u201d\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvening, River.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018River,\u2019 that\u2019s Lee,\u201d Ron explained. \u201cThey\u2019ve all got code names, but you can usually tell \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShh!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cBut before we hear from Royal and Romulus,\u201d Lee went on, \u201clet\u2019s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don\u2019t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.\u201d\n\nHarry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one another in horror.\n\n\u201cA goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing the deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse \u2014 more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime.\n\n\u201cFinally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric\u2019s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic.\n\n\u201cListeners, I\u2019d like to invite you now to join us in a minute\u2019s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.\u201d\n\nSilence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lee\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd now we turn to regular contributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, River,\u201d said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring.\n\n\u201cKingsley!\u201d burst out Ron.\n\n\u201cWe know!\u201d said Hermione, hushing him.\n\n\u201cMuggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cHowever, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles\u2019 knowledge. I\u2019d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be \u2018Wizards first\u2019?\u201d asked Lee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that it\u2019s one short step from \u2018Wizards first\u2019 to \u2018Purebloods first,\u2019 and then to \u2018Death Eaters,\u2019\u201d replied Kingsley. \u201cWe\u2019re all human, aren\u2019t we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellently put, Royal, and you\u2019ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if ever we get out of this mess,\u201d said Lee. \u201cAnd now, over to Romulus for our popular feature \u2018Pals of Potter.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, River,\u201d said another very familiar voice; Ron started to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s Lupin!\u201d\n\n\u201cRomulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you\u2019ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Lupin firmly. \u201cThere is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. \u2018The Boy Who Lived\u2019 remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.\u201d\n\nA mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met?\n\n\u201cAnd what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him we\u2019re all with him in spirit,\u201d said Lupin, then hesitated slightly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears.\n\n\u201cNearly always right,\u201d she repeated.\n\n\u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d said Ron in surprise. \u201cBill told me Lupin\u2019s living with Tonks again! And apparently she\u2019s getting pretty big too. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter\u2019s who are suffering for their allegiance?\u201d Lee was saying.\n\n\u201cWell, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s still alive!\u201d muttered Ron.\n\n\u201cWe have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid\u201d \u2014 all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence \u2014 \u201cwell-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a \u2018Support Harry Potter\u2019 party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you\u2019ve got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?\u201d asked Lee.\n\n\u201cIt would tend to give you an edge,\u201d agreed Lupin gravely. \u201cMay I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid\u2019s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry\u2019s supporters against following Hagrid\u2019s lead. \u2018Support Harry Potter\u2019 parties are unwise in the present climate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed they are, Romulus,\u201d said Lee, \u201cso we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let\u2019s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, I\u2019d like to introduce a new correspondent: Rodent.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Rodent\u2019?\u201d said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together:\n\n\u201cFred!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 is it George?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Fred, I think,\u201d said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said,\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being \u2018Rodent,\u2019 no way, I told you I wanted to be \u2018Rapier\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all right then. \u2018Rapier,\u2019 could you please give us your take on the various stories we\u2019ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, River, I can,\u201d said Fred. \u201cAs our listeners will know, unless they\u2019ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who\u2019s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich suits him, of course,\u201d said Kingsley. \u201cThe air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Fred. \u201cSo, people, let\u2019s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill with a single glance from his eyes. That\u2019s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that\u2019s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it\u2019s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that\u2019s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the weight of tension leaving him.\n\n\u201cAnd the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?\u201d asked Lee.\n\n\u201cWell, who wouldn\u2019t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he\u2019s been putting in?\u201d asked Fred. \u201cPoint is, people, don\u2019t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he\u2019s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn\u2019t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don\u2019t count on him being a long way away if you\u2019re planning on taking any risks. I never thought I\u2019d hear myself say it, but safety first!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,\u201d said Lee. \u201cListeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don\u2019t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next password will be \u2018Mad-Eye.\u2019 Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.\u201d\n\nThe radio\u2019s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep.\n\n\u201cGood, eh?\u201d said Ron happily.\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so brave of them,\u201d sighed Hermione admiringly. \u201cIf they were found . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they keep on the move, don\u2019t they?\u201d said Ron. \u201cLike us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut did you hear what Fred said?\u201d asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his thoughts turned again toward his all-consuming obsession. \u201cHe\u2019s abroad! He\u2019s still looking for the Wand, I knew it!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHARRY, NO!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 demort\u2019s after the Elder Wand!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name\u2019s Taboo!\u201d Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. \u201cI told you, Harry, I told you, we can\u2019t say it anymore \u2014 we\u2019ve got to put the protection back around us \u2014 quickly \u2014 it\u2019s how they find \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out.\n\n\u201cCome out of there with your hands up!\u201d came a rasping voice through the darkness. \u201cWe know you\u2019re in there! You\u2019ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don\u2019t care who we curse!\u201d"}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter23": "MALFOY MANOR\n\n\n\n\nHarry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness. He saw Hermione point her wand, not toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him.\n\n\u201cGet up, vermin.\u201d\n\nUnknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground. Before he could stop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too.\n\n\u201cGet \u2014 off \u2014 her!\u201d Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, \u201cNo! Leave him alone, leave him alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cYour boyfriend\u2019s going to have worse than that done to him if he\u2019s on my list,\u201d said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. \u201cDelicious girl . . . What a treat . . . I do enjoy the softness of the skin. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach turned over. He knew who this was: Fenrir Greyback, the werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery.\n\n\u201cSearch the tent!\u201d said another voice.\n\nHarry was thrown facedown onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been cast down beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched.\n\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s see who we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Greyback\u2019s gloating voice from overhead, and Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam of wandlight fell into his face and Greyback laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer immediately.\n\n\u201cI said,\u201d repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain, \u201cwhat happened to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cStung,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cBeen stung.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, looks like it,\u201d said a second voice.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d snarled Greyback.\n\n\u201cDudley,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAnd your first name?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 Vernon. Vernon Dudley.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheck the list, Scabior,\u201d said Greyback, and Harry heard him move sideways to look down at Ron, instead. \u201cAnd what about you, ginger?\u201d\n\n\u201cStan Shunpike,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cLike \u2019ell you are,\u201d said the man called Scabior. \u201cWe know Stan Shunpike, \u2019e\u2019s put a bit of work our way.\u201d\n\nThere was another thud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019b Bardy,\u201d said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. \u201cBardy Weadley.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Weasley?\u201d rasped Greyback. \u201cSo you\u2019re related to blood traitors even if you\u2019re not a Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend . . .\u201d The relish in his voice made Harry\u2019s flesh crawl.\n\n\u201cEasy, Greyback,\u201d said Scabior over the jeering of the others.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to bite just yet. We\u2019ll see if she\u2019s a bit quicker at remembering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly?\u201d\n\n\u201cPenelope Clearwater,\u201d said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but convincing.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your blood status?\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf-blood,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cEasy enough to check,\u201d said Scabior. \u201cBut the \u2019ole lot of \u2019em look like they could still be \u2019ogwarts age \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019b lebt,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cLeft, \u2019ave you, ginger?\u201d said Scabior. \u201cAnd you decided to go camping? And you thought, just for a laugh, you\u2019d use the Dark Lord\u2019s name?\u201d\n\n\u201cNod a laugh,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAggiden.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccident?\u201d There was more jeering laughter.\n\n\u201cYou know who used to like using the Dark Lord\u2019s name, Weasley?\u201d growled Greyback. \u201cThe Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they don\u2019t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name\u2019s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We\u2019ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!\u201d\n\nSomeone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him down into a sitting position, then started binding him back-to-back with other people. Harry was still half blind, barely able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at last the man tying them had walked away, Harry whispered to the other prisoners.\n\n\u201cAnyone still got a wand?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron and Hermione from either side of him.\n\n\u201cThis is all my fault. I said the name, I\u2019m sorry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\nIt was a new, but familiar, voice, and it came from directly behind Harry, from the person tied to Hermione\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cDean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is you! If they find out who they\u2019ve got \u2014 ! They\u2019re Snatchers, they\u2019re only looking for truants to sell for gold \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bad little haul for one night,\u201d Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent. \u201cA Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and three truants. You checked their names on the list yet, Scabior?\u201d he roared.\n\n\u201cYeah. There\u2019s no Vernon Dudley on \u2019ere, Greyback.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d said Greyback. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d\n\nHe crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and sores at the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and blood.\n\n\u201cSo you aren\u2019t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different name? What House were you in at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cSlytherin,\u201d said Harry automatically.\n\n\u201cFunny \u2019ow they all thinks we wants to \u2019ear that,\u201d jeered Scabior out of the shadows. \u201cBut none of \u2019em can tell us where the common room is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the dungeons,\u201d said Harry clearly. \u201cYou enter through the wall. It\u2019s full of skulls and stuff and it\u2019s under the lake, so the light\u2019s all green.\u201d\n\nThere was a short pause.\n\n\u201cWell, well, looks like we really \u2019ave caught a little Slytherin,\u201d said Scabior. \u201cGood for you, Vernon, \u2019cause there ain\u2019t a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who\u2019s your father?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe works at the Ministry,\u201d Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case. \u201cDepartment of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what, Greyback,\u201d said Scabior. \u201cI think there is a Dudley in there.\u201d\n\nHarry could barely breathe: Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this?\n\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the son of a Ministry official. Harry\u2019s heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it. \u201cIf you\u2019re telling the truth, ugly, you\u2019ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father\u2019ll reward us just for picking you up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Harry, his mouth bone dry, \u201cif you just let us \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d came a shout from inside the tent. \u201cLook at this, Greyback!\u201d\n\nA dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver in the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor\u2019s sword.\n\n\u201cVe-e-ry nice,\u201d said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. \u201cOh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my father\u2019s,\u201d Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. \u201cWe borrowed it to cut firewood \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!\u201d\n\nAs Scabior said it, Harry\u2019s scar, which was stretched tight across his distended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding; Voldemort\u2019s thoughts had suddenly become razor-sharp again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose. . . .\n\nSo close . . . So close . . .\n\nWith a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort\u2019s thoughts, pulling himself back to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, listening to Greyback and Scabior.\n\n\u201c\u2018\u2019ermione Granger,\u2019\u201d Scabior was saying, \u201c\u2018the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with \u2019arry Potter.\u2019\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present, not to slip into Voldemort\u2019s mind. He heard the creak of Greyback\u2019s boots as he crouched down in front of Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t! It isn\u2019t me!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s terrified squeak was as good as a confession.\n\n\u201c\u2018 . . . known to be traveling with Harry Potter,\u2019\u201d repeated Greyback quietly.\n\nA stillness had settled over the scene. Harry\u2019s scar was exquisitely painful, but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of Voldemort\u2019s thoughts: It had never been so important to remain in his own right mind.\n\n\u201cWell, this changes things, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d whispered Greyback. Nobody spoke: Harry sensed the gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione\u2019s arm trembling against his. Greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that on your forehead, Vernon?\u201d he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry\u2019s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d Harry yelled; he could not stop himself; he thought he might be sick from the pain of it.\n\n\u201cI thought you wore glasses, Potter?\u201d breathed Greyback.\n\n\u201cI found glasses!\u201d yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. \u201cThere was glasses in the tent, Greyback, wait \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd seconds later Harry\u2019s glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The Snatchers were closing in now, peering at him.\n\n\u201cIt is!\u201d rasped Greyback. \u201cWe\u2019ve caught Potter!\u201d\n\nThey all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry, still fighting to remain present inside his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say: Fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind \u2014\n\n\u2014 He was gliding around the high walls of the black fortress \u2014\n\nNo, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger \u2014\n\n\u2014 looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower \u2014\n\nHe was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices \u2014\n\n\u2014 Time to fly . . .\n\n\u201c. . . to the Ministry?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo hell with the Ministry,\u201d growled Greyback. \u201cThey\u2019ll take the credit, and we won\u2019t get a look in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you summon \u2019im? \u2019ere?\u201d said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d snarled Greyback, \u201cI haven\u2019t got \u2014 they say he\u2019s using the Malfoys\u2019 place as a base. We\u2019ll take the boy there.\u201d\n\nHarry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The werewolf might be allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort\u2019s inner circle were branded with the Dark Mark: Greyback had not been granted this highest honor.\n\nHarry\u2019s scar seared again \u2014\n\n\u2014 and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the window at the very top of the tower \u2014\n\n\u201c. . . completely sure it\u2019s him? \u2019Cause if it ain\u2019t, Greyback, we\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s in charge here?\u201d roared Greyback, covering his moment of inadequacy. \u201cI say that\u2019s Potter, and him plus his wand, that\u2019s two hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you\u2019re too gutless to come along, any of you, it\u2019s all for me, and with any luck, I\u2019ll get the girl thrown in!\u201d\n\n\u2014 The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for a man to enter. . . . A skeletal figure was just visible through it, curled beneath a blanket. . . . Dead, or sleeping . . . ?\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d said Scabior. \u201cAll right, we\u2019re in! And what about the rest of \u2019em, Greyback, what\u2019ll we do with \u2019em?\u201d\n\n\u201cMight as well take the lot. We\u2019ve got two Mudbloods, that\u2019s another ten Galleons. Give me the sword as well. If they\u2019re rubies, that\u2019s another small fortune right there.\u201d\n\nThe prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Hermione\u2019s breathing, fast and terrified.\n\n\u201cGrab hold and make it tight. I\u2019ll do Potter!\u201d said Greyback, seizing a fistful of Harry\u2019s hair; Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. \u201cOn three! One \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014\u201d\n\nThey Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry struggled, trying to throw off Greyback\u2019s hand, but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side, he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still \u2014\n\n\u2014 as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor, inside the cell-like room \u2014\n\nThe prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. Harry\u2019s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had not happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to get to this place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another matter. . . .\n\nOne of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them.\n\n\u201cHow do we get in? They\u2019re locked, Greyback, I can\u2019t \u2014 blimey!\u201d\n\nHe whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice: \u201cState your purpose!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got Potter!\u201d Greyback roared triumphantly. \u201cWe\u2019ve captured Harry Potter!\u201d\n\nThe gates swung open.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by Greyback; now he was staggering along sideways, tied back-to-back to the four other prisoners. Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he knew yet that Harry was caught. . . .\n\nThe emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, eyes opening in a skull of a face. . . . The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. . . .\n\n\u201cSo, you have come. I thought you would . . . one day. But your journey was pointless. I never had it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou lie!\u201d\n\nAs Voldemort\u2019s anger throbbed inside him, Harry\u2019s scar threatened to burst with pain, and he wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel.\n\nLight spilled out over all of them.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d said a woman\u2019s cold voice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\u201d rasped Greyback.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know me!\u201d There was resentment in the werewolf\u2019s voice. \u201cFenrir Greyback! We\u2019ve caught Harry Potter!\u201d\n\nGreyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too.\n\n\u201cI know \u2019e\u2019s swollen, ma\u2019am, but it\u2019s \u2019im!\u201d piped up Scabior. \u201cIf you look a bit closer, you\u2019ll see \u2019is scar. And this \u2019ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who\u2019s been traveling around with \u2019im, ma\u2019am. There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s \u2019im, and we\u2019ve got \u2019is wand as well! \u2019Ere, ma\u2019am \u2014\u201d\n\nThrough his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows.\n\n\u201cBring them in,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits.\n\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. \u201cMy son, Draco, is home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.\u201d\n\nThe drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\nThe dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry\u2019s ears. He was panicking now: He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out Voldemort\u2019s thoughts, though his scar was still burning.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019ve got Potter,\u201d said Narcissa\u2019s cold voice. \u201cDraco, come here.\u201d\n\nHarry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely: a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.\n\nGreyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier.\n\n\u201cWell, boy?\u201d rasped the werewolf.\n\nHarry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld Place.\n\nHis face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione\u2019s jinx. His black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter approached.\n\n\u201cWell, Draco?\u201d said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. \u201cIs it? Is it Harry Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t be sure,\u201d said Draco. He was keeping his distance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him.\n\n\u201cBut look at him carefully, look! Come closer!\u201d\n\nHarry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.\n\n\u201cDraco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, we won\u2019t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy?\u201d said Greyback menacingly.\n\n\u201cOf course not, of course not!\u201d said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry himself, came so close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d Lucius asked Greyback. \u201cHow did he get into this state?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t us.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,\u201d said Lucius.\n\nHis gray eyes raked Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something there,\u201d he whispered, \u201cit could be the scar, stretched tight. . . . Draco, come here, look properly! What do you think?\u201d\n\nHarry saw Draco\u2019s face up close now, right beside his father\u2019s. They were extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, Draco\u2019s expression was full of reluctance, even fear.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching.\n\n\u201cWe had better be certain, Lucius,\u201d Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, clear voice. \u201cCompletely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord . . . They say this is his\u201d \u2014 she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand \u2014 \u201cbut it does not resemble Ollivander\u2019s description. . . . If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the Mudblood, then?\u201d growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light fell on Hermione instead.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Narcissa sharply. \u201cYes \u2014 yes, she was in Madam Malkin\u2019s with Potter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn\u2019t it the Granger girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . maybe . . . yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then, that\u2019s the Weasley boy!\u201d shouted Lucius, striding around the bound prisoners to face Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s them, Potter\u2019s friends \u2014 Draco, look at him, isn\u2019t it Arthur Weasley\u2019s son, what\u2019s his name \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. \u201cIt could be.\u201d\n\nThe drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of the voice wound Harry\u2019s fear to an even higher pitch.\n\n\u201cWhat is this? What\u2019s happened, Cissy?\u201d\n\nBellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry\u2019s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes.\n\n\u201cBut surely,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cthis is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, it\u2019s Granger!\u201d cried Lucius. \u201cAnd beside her, we think, Potter! Potter and his friends, caught at last!\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter?\u201d shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. \u201cAre you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!\u201d\n\nShe dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to summon her beloved master \u2014\n\n\u201cI was about to call him!\u201d said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon Bellatrix\u2019s wrist, preventing her from touching the Mark. \u201cI shall summon him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house, and it is therefore upon my authority \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour authority!\u201d she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. \u201cYou lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBegging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,\u201d interjected Greyback, \u201cbut it\u2019s us that caught Potter, and it\u2019s us that\u2019ll be claiming the gold \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGold!\u201d laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law, her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand. \u201cTake your gold, filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I seek only the honor of his \u2014 of \u2014\u201d\n\nShe stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry could not see. Jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve \u2014\n\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d shrieked Bellatrix. \u201cDo not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!\u201d\n\nLucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode out of Harry\u2019s limited line of vision.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he heard her say.\n\n\u201cSword,\u201d grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher.\n\n\u201cGive it to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not yorn, missus, it\u2019s mine, I reckon I found it.\u201d\n\nThere was a bang and a flash of red light: Harry knew that the Snatcher had been Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his fellows: Scabior drew his wand.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think you\u2019re playing at, woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cStupefy!\u201d she screamed. \u201cStupefy!\u201d\n\nThey were no match for her, even though there were four of them against one of her: She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen.\n\n\u201cWhere did you get this sword?\u201d she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip.\n\n\u201cHow dare you?\u201d he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. \u201cRelease me, woman!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you find this sword?\u201d she repeated, brandishing it in his face. \u201cSnape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was in their tent,\u201d rasped Greyback. \u201cRelease me, I say!\u201d\n\nShe waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary to approach her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back.\n\n\u201cDraco, move this scum outside,\u201d said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare speak to Draco like \u2014\u201d said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix screamed,\n\n\u201cBe quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious problem!\u201d\n\nShe stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. Then she turned to look at the silent prisoners.\n\n\u201cIf it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,\u201d she muttered, more to herself than to the others. \u201cThe Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself. . . . But if he finds out . . . I must . . . I must know. . . .\u201d\n\nShe turned back to her sister again.\n\n\u201cThe prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my house, Bella, you don\u2019t give orders in my \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it! You have no idea of the danger we are in!\u201d shrieked Bellatrix. She looked frightening, mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet.\n\nNarcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf.\n\n\u201cTake these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Bellatrix sharply. \u201cAll except . . . except for the Mudblood.\u201d\n\nGreyback gave a grunt of pleasure.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Ron. \u201cYou can have me, keep me!\u201d\n\nBellatrix hit him across the face; the blow echoed around the room.\n\n\u201cIf she dies under questioning, I\u2019ll take you next,\u201d she said. \u201cBlood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more to them \u2014 yet.\u201d\n\nShe threw Greyback\u2019s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under her robes. She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door, into a dark passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force.\n\n\u201cReckon she\u2019ll let me have a bit of the girl when she\u2019s finished with her?\u201d Greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor. \u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019ll get a bite or two, wouldn\u2019t you, ginger?\u201d\n\nHarry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible, drawn-out scream from directly above them.\n\n\u201cHERMIONE!\u201d Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together, so that Harry staggered. \u201cHERMIONE!\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet!\u201d Harry said. \u201cShut up, Ron, we need to work out a way \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHERMIONE! HERMIONE!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a plan, stop yelling \u2014 we need to get these ropes off \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d came a whisper through the darkness. \u201cRon? Is that you?\u201d\n\nRon stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry saw a shadow moving closer.\n\n\u201cHarry? Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cLuna?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s me! Oh no, I didn\u2019t want you to be caught!\u201d\n\n\u201cLuna, can you help us get these ropes off?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOh yes, I expect so. . . . There\u2019s an old nail we use if we need to break anything. . . . Just a moment . . .\u201d\n\nHermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix screaming too, but her words were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, \u201cHERMIONE! HERMIONE!\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Ollivander?\u201d Harry could hear Luna saying. \u201cMr. Ollivander, have you got the nail? If you just move over a little bit . . . I think it was beside the water jug. . . .\u201d\n\nShe was back within seconds.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to stay still,\u201d she said.\n\nHarry could feel her digging at the rope\u2019s tough fibers to work the knots free. From upstairs they heard Bellatrix\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found it \u2014 we found it \u2014 PLEASE!\u201d Hermione screamed again; Ron struggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry\u2019s wrist.\n\n\u201cRon, please stay still!\u201d Luna whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t see what I\u2019m doing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy pocket!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIn my pocket, there\u2019s a Deluminator, and it\u2019s full of light!\u201d\n\nA few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar: Unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung there, like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with light. Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner. Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean and Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans.\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s much easier, thanks, Ron,\u201d said Luna, and she began hacking at their bindings again. \u201cHello, Dean!\u201d\n\nFrom above came Bellatrix\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cYou are lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth!\u201d\n\nAnother terrible scream \u2014\n\n\u201cHERMIONE!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else did you take? What else have you got? Tell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d\n\nHarry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, said \u201cThanks\u201d to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank onto the cellar floor, looking groggy and disoriented, many welts across his swarthy face.\n\nRon was now trying to Disapparate without a wand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way out, Ron,\u201d said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. \u201cThe cellar is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he\u2019s tried everything.\u201d\n\nHermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry like physical pain. Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless.\n\n\u201cWhat else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrid\u2019s pouch from around his neck and groped inside it: He pulled out Dumbledore\u2019s Snitch and shook it, hoping for he did not know what \u2014 nothing happened \u2014 he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless \u2014 the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue \u2014\n\nDumbledore\u2019s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror.\n\n\u201cHelp us!\u201d he yelled at it in mad desperation. \u201cWe\u2019re in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!\u201d\n\nThe eye blinked and was gone.\n\nHarry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was bellowing, \u201cHERMIONE! HERMIONE!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get into my vault?\u201d they heard Bellatrix scream. \u201cDid that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only met him tonight!\u201d Hermione sobbed. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been inside your vault. . . . It isn\u2019t the real sword! It\u2019s a copy, just a copy!\u201d\n\n\u201cA copy?\u201d screeched Bellatrix. \u201cOh, a likely story!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we can find out easily!\u201d came Lucius\u2019s voice. \u201cDraco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!\u201d\n\nHarry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor.\n\n\u201cGriphook,\u201d he whispered into the goblin\u2019s pointed ear, \u201cyou must tell them that sword\u2019s a fake, they mustn\u2019t know it\u2019s the real one, Griphook, please \u2014\u201d\n\nHe could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps; next moment, Draco\u2019s shaking voice spoke from behind the door.\n\n\u201cStand back. Line up against the back wall. Don\u2019t try anything, or I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d\n\nThey did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar\u2019s darkness. The door flew open; Malfoy marched inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar.\n\nRon clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst.\n\n\u201cDOB \u2014 !\u201d\n\nHarry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his mistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix.\n\nDobby\u2019s enormous, tennis-ball-shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, \u201cDobby has come to rescue you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how did you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nAn awful scream drowned Harry\u2019s words: Hermione was being tortured again. He cut to the essentials.\n\n\u201cYou can Disapparate out of this cellar?\u201d he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears flapping.\n\n\u201cAnd you can take humans with you?\u201d\n\nDobby nodded again.\n\n\u201cRight. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and take them \u2014 take them to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBill and Fleur\u2019s,\u201d said Ron. \u201cShell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!\u201d\n\nThe elf nodded for a third time.\n\n\u201cAnd then come back,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCan you do that, Dobby?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, Harry Potter,\u201d whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr. Ollivander, who appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker\u2019s hands in his own, then held out the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved.\n\n\u201cHarry, we want to help you!\u201d Luna whispered.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave you here,\u201d said Dean.\n\n\u201cGo, both of you! We\u2019ll see you at Bill and Fleur\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAs Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully.\n\n\u201cKill me, then, Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring you what you seek. . . . There is so much you do not understand. . . .\u201d\n\nHe felt Voldemort\u2019s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out, returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present.\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d Harry beseeched Luna and Dean. \u201cGo! We\u2019ll follow, just go!\u201d\n\nThey caught hold of the elf\u2019s outstretched fingers. There was another loud crack, and Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. \u201cDid you hear that? What was that noise in the cellar?\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron stared at each other.\n\n\u201cDraco \u2014 no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!\u201d\n\nFootsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to try and tackle him,\u201d he whispered to Ron. They had no choice: The moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. \u201cLeave the lights on,\u201d Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d came Wormtail\u2019s voice. \u201cStand away from the door. I am coming in.\u201d\n\nThe door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon him. Ron seized Wormtail\u2019s wand arm and forced it upward; Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling his voice. Silently they struggled: Wormtail\u2019s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed around Harry\u2019s throat.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Wormtail?\u201d called Lucius Malfoy from above.\n\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail\u2019s wheezy voice. \u201cAll fine!\u201d\n\nHarry could barely breathe.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me?\u201d Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. \u201cAfter I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!\u201d\n\nThe silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Wormtail\u2019s mouth. He saw the ratlike man\u2019s small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that moment of weakness.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll have that,\u201d whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail\u2019s wand from his other hand.\n\nWandless, helpless, Pettigrew\u2019s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from Harry\u2019s face to something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014\u201d\n\nWithout pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\nRon had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail\u2019s throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue.\n\n\u201cRelashio!\u201d said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. Wormtail\u2019s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still.\n\nHarry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail\u2019s body on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room. Cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, which was ajar. Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor\u2019s sword in his long-fingered hands. Hermione was lying at Bellatrix\u2019s feet. She was barely stirring.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Bellatrix said to Griphook. \u201cIs it the true sword?\u201d\n\nHarry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Griphook. \u201cIt is a fake.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d panted Bellatrix. \u201cQuite sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the goblin.\n\nRelief broke across her face, all tension drained from it.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblin\u2019s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. \u201cAnd now,\u201d she said in a voice that burst with triumph, \u201cwe call the Dark Lord!\u201d\n\nAnd she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark.\n\nAt once, Harry\u2019s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true surroundings vanished: He was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt \u2014 he had warned them, he had told them to summon him for nothing less than Potter. If they were mistaken . . .\n\n\u201cKill me, then!\u201d demanded the old man. \u201cYou will not win, you cannot win! That wand will never, ever be yours \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd Voldemort\u2019s fury broke: A burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort returned to the window, his wrath barely controllable . . . They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back. . . .\n\n\u201cAnd I think,\u201d said Bellatrix\u2019s voice, \u201cwe can dispose of the Mudblood. Greyback, take her if you want her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d\n\nRon had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked; she turned her wand to face Ron instead \u2014\n\n\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d he roared, pointing Wormtail\u2019s wand at Bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, Draco, and Greyback wheeled about; Harry yelled, \u201cStupefy!\u201d and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. Jets of light flew from Draco\u2019s, Narcissa\u2019s, and Greyback\u2019s wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a sofa to avoid them.\n\n\u201cSTOP OR SHE DIES!\u201d\n\nPanting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting Hermione, who seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to Hermione\u2019s throat.\n\n\u201cDrop your wands,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDrop them, or we\u2019ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!\u201d\n\nRon stood rigid, clutching Wormtail\u2019s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI said, drop them!\u201d she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione\u2019s throat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there.\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix\u2019s wand onto the floor at his feet. Ron did the same with Wormtail\u2019s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d she leered. \u201cDraco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter! Your death approaches!\u201d\n\nHarry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel Voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands, \u201cCissy, I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.\u201d\n\nAt the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions: Draco doubled over, his hands covering his bloody face.\n\nAs Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took his chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco\u2019s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, \u201cStupefy!\u201d The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground.\n\nAs Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway.\n\n\u201cDobby!\u201d she screamed, and even Bellatrix froze. \u201cYou! You dropped the chandelier \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nThe tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress.\n\n\u201cYou must not hurt Harry Potter,\u201d he squeaked.\n\n\u201cKill him, Cissy!\u201d shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and Narcissa\u2019s wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room.\n\n\u201cYou dirty little monkey!\u201d bawled Bellatrix. \u201cHow dare you take a witch\u2019s wand, how dare you defy your masters?\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby has no master!\u201d squealed the elf. \u201cDobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, seconds before Voldemort was with them.\n\n\u201cRon, catch \u2014 and GO!\u201d he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby\u2019s hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate.\n\nAs he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron\u2019s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix\u2019s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing \u2014\n\nBill and Fleur\u2019s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur\u2019s . . .\n\nHe had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his forehead pierced him, and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of Gryffindor\u2019s sword bumping against his back; Dobby\u2019s hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that was fine with him. . . .\n\nAnd then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, relinquished Dobby\u2019s hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered.\n\nHarry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it.\n\n\u201cDobby, is this Shell Cottage?\u201d he whispered, clutching the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys\u2019, ready to fight if he needed to. \u201cHave we come to the right place? Dobby?\u201d\n\nHe looked around. The little elf stood feet from him.\n\n\u201cDOBBY!\u201d\n\nThe elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf\u2019s heaving chest.\n\n\u201cDobby \u2014 no \u2014 HELP!\u201d Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. \u201cHELP!\u201d\n\nHe did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby\u2019s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass.\n\n\u201cDobby, no, don\u2019t die, don\u2019t die \u2014\u201d\n\nThe elf\u2019s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words.\n\n\u201cHarry . . . Potter . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter24": "THE WANDMAKER\n\n\n\n\nIt was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore\u2019s body at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix\u2019s silver knife. Harry\u2019s voice was still saying, \u201cDobby . . . Dobby . . .\u201d even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back.\n\nAfter a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf.\n\n\u201cHermione?\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon\u2019s taken her inside,\u201d said Bill. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nHarry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf\u2019s body, then dragged off his own jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket.\n\nThe sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making suggestions about burying the elf. Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry\u2019s grief for Dobby seemed to diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean.\n\n\u201cI want to do it properly,\u201d were the first words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. \u201cNot by magic. Have you got a spade?\u201d\n\nAnd shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.\n\nHis scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out . . . though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love. . . .\n\nOn Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys\u2019 returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness. . . .\n\nThe steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hallows . . . Horcruxes . . . Hallows . . . Horcruxes . . . Yet he no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed it out: He felt as though he had been slapped awake again.\n\nDeeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why. . . .\n\nAnd he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy . . . Dumbledore had foreseen that. . . . How much more had he known?\n\nHarry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter,\u201d said Ron. \u201cFleur\u2019s looking after her.\u201d\n\nHarry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own, and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough.\n\nHarry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed upon the elf\u2019s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby\u2019s head, muffling his batlike ears.\n\n\u201cWe should close his eyes.\u201d\n\nHarry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur\u2019s coats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf\u2019s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNow he could be sleeping.\u201d\n\nHarry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he remembered Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore\u2019s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole.\n\n\u201cI think we ought to say something,\u201d piped up Luna. \u201cI\u2019ll go first, shall I?\u201d\n\nAnd as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave.\n\n\u201cThank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It\u2019s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I\u2019ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you\u2019re happy now.\u201d\n\nShe turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, \u201cYeah . . . thanks, Dobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d muttered Dean.\n\nHarry swallowed.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Dobby,\u201d he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you mind if I stay here a moment?\u201d he asked the others.\n\nThey murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf.\n\nHe looked around: There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where Dobby\u2019s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand.\n\nThere were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someone\u2019s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock.\n\nSlowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock\u2019s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read:\n\nHERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF.\n\n\n\nHe looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible.\n\nThey were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening.\n\n\u201c. . . lucky that Ginny\u2019s on holiday. If she\u2019d been at Hogwarts, they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know she\u2019s safe too.\u201d\n\nHe looked around and saw Harry standing there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,\u201d he explained. \u201cMoved them to Muriel\u2019s. The Death Eaters know Ron\u2019s with you now, they\u2019re bound to target the family \u2014 don\u2019t apologize,\u201d he added at the sight of Harry\u2019s expression. \u201cIt was always a matter of time, Dad\u2019s been saying so for months. We\u2019re the biggest blood-traitor family there is.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are they protected?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cFidelius Charm. Dad\u2019s Secret-Keeper. And we\u2019ve done it on this cottage too; I\u2019m Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that\u2019s hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we\u2019ll move them to Muriel\u2019s too. There isn\u2019t much room here, but she\u2019s got plenty. Griphook\u2019s legs are on the mend, Fleur\u2019s given him Skele-Gro; we could probably move them in an hour or \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said, and Bill looked startled. \u201cI need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nHe heard the authority in his own voice, the conviction, the sense of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby\u2019s grave. All of their faces were turned toward him, looking puzzled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to wash,\u201d Harry told Bill, looking down at his hands, still covered in mud and Dobby\u2019s blood. \u201cThen I\u2019ll need to see them, straightaway.\u201d\n\nHe walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden. . . .\n\nDobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come. Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\n\nHarry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all.\n\nAnd still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him one thing, his brain quite another. The Dumbledore in Harry\u2019s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer.\n\nYou gave Ron the Deluminator. You understood him . . . You gave him a way back. . . .\n\nAnd you understood Wormtail too . . . You knew there was a bit of regret there, somewhere. . . .\n\nAnd if you knew them . . . What did you know about me, Dumbledore?\n\nAm I meant to know, but not to seek? Did you know how hard I\u2019d find that? Is that why you made it this difficult? So I\u2019d have time to work that out?\n\nHarry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold rim of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and there flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well.\n\nBill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cI need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Fleur. \u201cYou will \u2019ave to wait, \u2019Arry. Zey are both ill, tired \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said without heat, \u201cbut it can\u2019t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately \u2014 and separately. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, what the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Bill. \u201cYou turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she\u2019s been tortured, and Ron\u2019s just refused to tell me anything \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t tell you what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Harry flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We\u2019re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.\u201d\n\nFleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally Bill said, \u201cAll right. Who do you want to talk to first?\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or Hallows?\n\n\u201cGriphook,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Griphook first.\u201d\n\nHis heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle.\n\n\u201cUp here, then,\u201d said Bill, leading the way.\n\nHarry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back.\n\n\u201cI need you two as well!\u201d he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.\n\nThey both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved.\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d Harry asked Hermione. \u201cYou were amazing \u2014 coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing now, Harry?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see. Come on.\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. Three doors led off it.\n\n\u201cIn here,\u201d said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur\u2019s room. It too had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.\n\nBill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the bed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to take you out of bed,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHow are your legs?\u201d\n\n\u201cPainful,\u201d replied the goblin. \u201cBut mending.\u201d\n\nHe was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin\u2019s sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his shoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human\u2019s.\n\n\u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember \u2014\u201d Harry began.\n\n\u201c\u2014 that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you ever visited Gringotts?\u201d said Griphook. \u201cI remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.\u201d\n\nHarry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up. Harry\u2019s scar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request, the goblin broke the silence.\n\n\u201cYou buried the elf,\u201d he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous. \u201cI watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\nGriphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes.\n\n\u201cYou are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently.\n\n\u201cYou dug the grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\nGriphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby\u2019s grave or not. He gathered himself for the attack.\n\n\u201cGriphook, I need to ask \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou also rescued a goblin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brought me here. Saved me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I take it you\u2019re not sorry?\u201d said Harry a little impatiently.\n\n\u201cNo, Harry Potter,\u201d said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, \u201cbut you are a very odd wizard.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.\u201d\n\nThe goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him.\n\n\u201cI need to break into a Gringotts vault.\u201d\n\nHarry had not meant to say it so baldly; the words were forced from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014\u201d said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook.\n\n\u201cBreak into a Gringotts vault?\u201d repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the bed. \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Ron contradicted him. \u201cIt\u2019s been done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vault in question was empty at the time,\u201d snapped the goblin, and Harry understood that even though Griphook had left Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being breached. \u201cIts protection was minimal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the vault we need to get into isn\u2019t empty, and I\u2019m guessing its protection will be pretty powerful,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt belongs to the Lestranges.\u201d\n\nHe saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given his answer.\n\n\u201cYou have no chance,\u201d said Griphook flatly. \u201cNo chance at all. If you seek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThief, you have been warned, beware \u2014 yeah, I know, I remember,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to get myself any treasure, I\u2019m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?\u201d\n\nThe goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation.\n\n\u201cIf there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain,\u201d said Griphook finally, \u201cit would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWand-carriers,\u201d repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door.\n\n\u201cThe right to carry a wand,\u201d said the goblin quietly, \u201chas long been contested between wizards and goblins.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, goblins can do magic without wands,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThat is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wandlore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, goblins won\u2019t share any of their magic either,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Harry, noting Griphook\u2019s rising color. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature \u2014\u201d\n\nGriphook gave a nasty laugh.\n\n\u201cBut it is, it is about precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do!\u201d said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. \u201cWe protest! And I\u2019m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I\u2019m a Mudblood!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call yourself \u2014\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cMudblood, and proud of it! I\u2019ve got no higher position under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys\u2019!\u201d\n\nAs she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat.\n\n\u201cDid you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you know that we\u2019ve wanted elves to be freed for years?\u201d (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione\u2019s chair.) \u201cYou can\u2019t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!\u201d\n\nThe goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had shown Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat do you seek within the Lestranges\u2019 vault?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cThe sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one.\u201d He looked from one to the other of them. \u201cI think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the fake sword isn\u2019t the only thing in that vault, is it?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve seen the other things in there?\u201d\n\nHis heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar.\n\nThe goblin twisted his beard around his finger again.\n\n\u201cIt is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our fingers.\u201d\n\nThe goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back again.\n\n\u201cSo young,\u201d he said finally, \u201cto be fighting so many.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you help us?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin\u2019s help. You\u2019re our one chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall . . . think about it,\u201d said Griphook maddeningly.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur\u2019s bed, \u201cthat the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin\u2019s eyes as he closed the door upon him.\n\n\u201cLittle git,\u201d whispered Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying keeping us hanging.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the still-dark landing, \u201care you saying what I think you\u2019re saying? Are you saying there\u2019s a Horcrux in the Lestranges\u2019 vault?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBellatrix was terrified when she thought we\u2019d been in there, she was beside herself. Why? What did she think we\u2019d seen, what else did she think we might have taken? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who\u2019s been, places he\u2019s done something important?\u201d said Ron, looking baffled. \u201cWas he ever inside the Lestranges\u2019 vault?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander.\n\n\u201cI think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think he\u2019d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don\u2019t forget, he trusted Bellatrix and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him.\u201d\n\nHarry rubbed his scar.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me . . . except for Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nWhen Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head.\n\n\u201cYou really understand him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBits of him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBits . . . I just wish I\u2019d understood Dumbledore as much. But we\u2019ll see. Come on \u2014 Ollivander now.\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione looked bewildered but impressed as they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur\u2019s. A weak \u201cCome in!\u201d answered them.\n\nThe wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave.\n\n\u201cMr. Ollivander, I\u2019m sorry to disturb you,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy.\u201d Ollivander\u2019s voice was feeble. \u201cYou rescued us. I thought we would die in that place. I can never thank you . . . never thank you . . . enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were glad to do it.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic . . . yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. Feigning a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand.\n\n\u201cMr. Ollivander, I need some help.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything. Anything,\u201d said the wandmaker weakly.\n\n\u201cCan you mend this? Is it possible?\u201d\n\nOllivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected halves into his palm.\n\n\u201cHolly and phoenix feather,\u201d said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. \u201cEleven inches. Nice and supple.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCan you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cI am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.\u201d\n\nHarry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys\u2019.\n\n\u201cCan you identify these?\u201d Harry asked.\n\nThe wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly.\n\n\u201cWalnut and dragon heartstring,\u201d he said. \u201cTwelve-and-three-quarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this one?\u201d\n\nOllivander performed the same examination.\n\n\u201cHawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas?\u201d repeated Harry. \u201cIsn\u2019t it still his?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps not. If you took it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 I did \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.\u201d\n\nThere was silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea.\n\n\u201cYou talk about wands like they\u2019ve got feelings,\u201d said Harry, \u201clike they can think for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wand chooses the wizard,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cThat much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.\u201d\n\n\u201cA person can still use a wand that hasn\u2019t chosen them, though?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cOh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.\u201d\n\nThe sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound.\n\n\u201cI took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCan I use it safely?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I should use this one?\u201d said Ron, pulling Wormtail\u2019s wand out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander.\n\n\u201cChestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this holds true for all wands, does it?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry\u2019s face. \u201cYou ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, it isn\u2019t necessary to kill the previous owner to take true possession of a wand?\u201d asked Harry.\n\nOllivander swallowed.\n\n\u201cNecessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are legends, though,\u201d said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort had decided to put his idea into action. \u201cLegends about a wand \u2014 or wands \u2014 that have passed from hand to hand by murder.\u201d\n\nOllivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear.\n\n\u201cOnly one wand, I think,\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cAnd You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn\u2019t he?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 how?\u201d croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,\u201d said Harry.\n\nOllivander looked terrified.\n\n\u201cHe tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I \u2014 I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou told him about the twin cores? You said he just had to borrow another wizard\u2019s wand?\u201d\n\nOllivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He nodded slowly.\n\n\u201cBut it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Harry went on. \u201cMine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you know why that is?\u201d\n\nOllivander shook his head as slowly as he had just nodded.\n\n\u201cI had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand should have snapped the borrowed wand, I do not know. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. When You-Know-Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and asked about that other wand, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer.\n\n\u201cYes, he asked,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cHe wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted.\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord,\u201d said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, \u201chad always been happy with the wand I made him \u2014 yew and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches \u2014 until he discovered the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019ll know soon, if he doesn\u2019t already, that mine\u2019s broken beyond repair,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione, sounding frightened. \u201cHe can\u2019t know that, Harry, how could he \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cPriori Incantatem,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys\u2019, Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells they\u2019ve cast lately, they\u2019ll see that yours broke mine, they\u2019ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they\u2019ll realize that I\u2019ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.\u201d\n\nThe little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about that now \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Ollivander intervened.\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd will it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,\u201d said Ollivander, \u201cbut the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable.\u201d\n\nHarry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first met, of how much he liked Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him.\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cYes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand\u2019s course through history. There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you \u2014 you don\u2019t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?\u201d Hermione asked hopefully.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cWhether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Ollivander,\u201d said Harry, \u201cyou told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nOllivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped.\n\n\u201cBut how \u2014 how do you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind how I know it,\u201d said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much farther north. \u201cYou told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a rumor,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cA rumor, years and years ago, long before you were born! I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business: that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I can see that,\u201d said Harry. He stood up. \u201cMr. Ollivander, one last thing, and then we\u2019ll let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2014 the what?\u201d asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered.\n\n\u201cThe Deathly Hallows.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Is this still something to do with wands?\u201d\n\nHarry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He did not know about the Hallows.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThank you very much. We\u2019ll leave you to get some rest now.\u201d\n\nOllivander looked stricken.\n\n\u201cHe was torturing me!\u201d he gasped. \u201cThe Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no idea. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.\u201d\n\nHe led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught a glimpse of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory was right. He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cGregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn\u2019t have it anymore: It was stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can\u2019t have been that difficult.\u201d\n\nVoldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer.\n\n\u201cAnd Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and he took the Elder Wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore had the Elder Wand?\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut then \u2014 where is it now?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden.\n\n\u201cBut then, let\u2019s go!\u201d said Ron urgently. \u201cHarry, let\u2019s go and get it before he does!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that,\u201d said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his head, trying to help it resist. \u201cHe knows where it is. He\u2019s there now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Ron said furiously. \u201cHow long have you known this \u2014 why have we been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone \u2014 we could still go \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. \u201cHermione\u2019s right. Dumbledore didn\u2019t want me to have it. He didn\u2019t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe unbeatable wand, Harry!\u201d moaned Ron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to . . . I\u2019m supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake.\n\n\u201cI shall join you in the castle shortly,\u201d he said in his high, cold voice. \u201cLeave me now.\u201d\n\nSnape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape\u2019s figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own eyes.\n\nAnd he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the beloved castle, his first kingdom, his birthright. . . .\n\nAnd here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How fitting that this would be its last great act.\n\nThe tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long and thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again.\n\nThe wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken, yet almost perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose: He felt amused derision. Dumbledore\u2019s hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, buried with him.\n\nHad the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand from Dumbledore\u2019s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter25": "SHELL COTTAGE\n\n\n\n\nBill and Fleur\u2019s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face.\n\nThe enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together.\n\n\u201cWhat if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?\u201d \u201cWhat if working out what the symbol meant made you \u2018worthy\u2019 to get the Hallows?\u201d \u201cHarry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-Who?\u201d\n\nHarry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him.\n\nThe odd thing was that Hermione\u2019s support made him feel just as confused as Ron\u2019s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered.\n\n\u201cYou could never have done that, Harry,\u201d she said again and again. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have broken into Dumbledore\u2019s grave.\u201d\n\nBut the idea of Dumbledore\u2019s corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore\u2019s intentions. He felt that he was still groping in the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died.\n\n\u201cBut is he dead?\u201d said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument.\n\n\u201cYes, he is, Ron, please don\u2019t start that again!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at the facts, Hermione,\u201d said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at the horizon. \u201cThe silver doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could have,\u201d said Harry without looking at her.\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t think you did, do you?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThere you go!\u201d said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t \u2014 but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he\u2019s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, it could\u2019ve been his ghost!\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore wouldn\u2019t come back as a ghost,\u201d said Harry. There was little about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. \u201cHe would have gone on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, \u2018gone on\u2019?\u201d asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, \u201c\u2019Arry?\u201d\n\nFleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze.\n\n\u201c\u2019Arry, Grip\u2019ook would like to speak to you. \u2019E eez in ze smallest bedroom, \u2019e says \u2019e does not want to be over\u2019eard.\u201d\n\nHer dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house.\n\nGriphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage\u2019s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage.\n\n\u201cI have reached my decision, Harry Potter,\u201d said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. \u201cThough the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d said Harry, relief surging through him. \u201cGriphook, thank you, we\u2019re really \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 in return,\u201d said the goblin firmly, \u201cfor payment.\u201d\n\nSlightly taken aback, Harry hesitated.\n\n\u201cHow much do you want? I\u2019ve got gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot gold,\u201d said Griphook. \u201cI have gold.\u201d\n\nHis black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes.\n\n\u201cI want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s spirits plummeted.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d said the goblin softly, \u201cwe have a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can give you something else,\u201d said Ron eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault.\u201d\n\nHe had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily.\n\n\u201cI am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sword\u2019s ours \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not,\u201d said the goblin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd before it was Gryffindor\u2019s, whose was it?\u201d demanded the goblin, sitting up straight.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt was made for him, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. \u201cWizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First\u2019s, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the goblins! The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!\u201d\n\nGriphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, \u201cWe need to discuss this, Griphook, if that\u2019s all right. Could you give us a few minutes?\u201d\n\nThe goblin nodded, looking sour.\n\nDownstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, \u201cHe\u2019s having a laugh. We can\u2019t let him have that sword.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true?\u201d Harry asked Hermione. \u201cWas the sword stolen by Gryffindor?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said hopelessly. \u201cWizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there\u2019s no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be one of those goblin stories,\u201d said Ron, \u201cabout how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn\u2019t asked for one of our wands.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThey\u2019ve been treated brutally in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoblins aren\u2019t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey\u2019ve killed plenty of us. They\u2019ve fought dirty too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn\u2019t going to make him more likely to help us, is it?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby\u2019s grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, \u201chow\u2019s this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault, and then he can have it. There\u2019s a fake in there, isn\u2019t there? We switch them, and give him the fake.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, he\u2019d know the difference better than we would!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who realized there had been a swap!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but we could scarper before he realizes \u2014\u201d\n\nHe quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cis despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don\u2019t like wizards, Ron?\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears had turned red.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What\u2019s your solution, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrilliant. I\u2019ll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap it.\u201d\n\nSilence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes.\n\nHe closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin. . . .\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s lying,\u201d Harry said, opening his eyes again. \u201cGriphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn\u2019t take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history\u2019s right?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it make a difference?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cChanges how I feel about it,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll tell him he can have the sword after he\u2019s helped us get into that vault \u2014 but we\u2019ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it.\u201d\n\nA grin spread slowly across Ron\u2019s face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed.\n\n\u201cHarry, we can\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can have it,\u201d Harry went on, \u201cafter we\u2019ve used it on all of the Horcruxes. I\u2019ll make sure he gets it then. I\u2019ll keep my word.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that could be years!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cI know that, but he needn\u2019t. I won\u2019t be lying . . . really.\u201d\n\nHarry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: FOR THE GREATER GOOD. He pushed the idea away. What choice did they have?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cNor do I, much,\u201d Harry admitted.\n\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s genius,\u201d said Ron, standing up again. \u201cLet\u2019s go and tell him.\u201d\n\nBack in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry.\n\n\u201cI have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThen shake,\u201d said the goblin, holding out his hand.\n\nHarry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, \u201cSo. We begin!\u201d\n\nIt was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled to work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook\u2019s preference, in semidarkness.\n\n\u201cI have visited the Lestranges\u2019 vault only once,\u201d Griphook told them, \u201con the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected. . . .\u201d\n\nThey remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really only enough left for one of us,\u201d said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be enough,\u201d said Harry, who was examining Griphook\u2019s hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways.\n\nThe other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill\u2019s eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned.\n\nThe longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures, and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges\u2019 vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: They needed Griphook.\n\nThe goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi.\n\nHarry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. \u201cI never meant you to have to deal with all of this.\u201d\n\nShe had just set some knives to work, chopping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced away behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened.\n\n\u201c\u2019Arry, you saved my sister\u2019s life, I do not forget.\u201d\n\nThis was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger.\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Fleur went on, pointing her wand at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, \u201cMr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel\u2019s zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze goblin,\u201d she scowled a little at the mention of him, \u201ccan move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean can take zat room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mind sleeping in the living room,\u201d said Harry, who knew that Griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about us.\u201d And when she tried to protest he went on, \u201cWe\u2019ll be off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won\u2019t need to be here much longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what do you mean?\u201d she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. \u201cOf course you must not leave, you are safe \u2019ere!\u201d\n\nShe looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door opened at that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood.\n\n\u201c. . . and tiny little ears,\u201d Luna was saying, \u201ca bit like a hippo\u2019s, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast. . . .\u201d\n\nLooking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance to escape Fleur\u2019s questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them.\n\n\u201c. . . and if you ever come to our house I\u2019ll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven\u2019t seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas,\u201d Luna was saying, as she and Dean relaid the fire.\n\n\u201cLuna, we told you,\u201d Hermione called over to her. \u201cThat horn exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,\u201d said Luna serenely. \u201cDaddy told me. It will probably have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know.\u201d\n\nHermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill\u2019s arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,\u201d said Luna, approaching the old man.\n\n\u201cAnd I you, my dear,\u201d said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. \u201cYou were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,\u201d said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. \u201cAnd I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill\u2019s Auntie Muriel? I never returned \u2019er tiara.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be an honor,\u201d said Ollivander with a little bow, \u201cthe very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.\u201d\n\nFleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp.\n\n\u201cMoonstones and diamonds,\u201d said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry noticing. \u201cMade by goblins, I think?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd paid for by wizards,\u201d said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging.\n\nA strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander set off into the night. The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; however, Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long hair tangled by the wind.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d he told Fleur. \u201cOllivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love. Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they\u2019re still operating an Owl-Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she thought we\u2019d stolen it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, she eez charmante, your aunt,\u201d said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the room.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s made a tiara,\u201d piped up Luna. \u201cWell, more of a crown, really.\u201d\n\nRon caught Harry\u2019s eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius.\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he\u2019s identified most of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a bang on the front door. Everyone\u2019s head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feet, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight.\n\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d Bill called.\n\n\u201cIt is I, Remus John Lupin!\u201d called a voice over the howling wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? \u201cI am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!\u201d\n\n\u201cLupin,\u201d muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open.\n\nLupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling cloak, his graying hair windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried aloud, \u201cIt\u2019s a boy! We\u2019ve named him Ted, after Dora\u2019s father!\u201d\n\nHermione shrieked.\n\n\u201cWha \u2014 ? Tonks \u2014 Tonks has had the baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, she\u2019s had the baby!\u201d shouted Lupin. All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, \u201cCongratulations!\u201d and Ron said, \u201cBlimey, a baby!\u201d as if he had never heard of such a thing before.\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 yes \u2014 a boy,\u201d said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He strode around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never have happened.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be godfather?\u201d he said as he released Harry.\n\n\u201cM-me?\u201d stammered Harry.\n\n\u201cYou, yes, of course \u2014 Dora quite agrees, no one better \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 yeah \u2014 blimey \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay long, I must get back,\u201d said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. \u201cThank you, thank you, Bill.\u201d\n\nBill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast.\n\n\u201cTo Teddy Remus Lupin,\u201d said Lupin, \u201ca great wizard in the making!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Oo does \u2019e look like?\u201d Fleur inquired.\n\n\u201cI think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it\u2019s turned ginger in the hour since. Probably be blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks\u2019s hair started changing color the day that she was born.\u201d He drained his goblet. \u201cOh, go on then, just one more,\u201d he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again.\n\nThe wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin\u2019s news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill\u2019s eyes following the goblin up the stairs.\n\n\u201cNo . . . no . . . I really must get back,\u201d said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, good-bye \u2014 I\u2019ll try and bring some pictures in a few days\u2019 time \u2014 they\u2019ll all be so glad to know that I\u2019ve seen you \u2014\u201d\n\nHe fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night.\n\n\u201cGodfather, Harry!\u201d said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table. \u201cA real honor! Congratulations!\u201d\n\nAs Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him closed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cI wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn\u2019t been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.\u201d\n\nBill hesitated.\n\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019re planning something with Griphook.\u201d\n\nIt was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting.\n\n\u201cI know goblins,\u201d said Bill. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends \u2014 or, at least, goblins I know well, and like.\u201d Again, Bill hesitated.\n\n\u201cHarry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSorry, Bill.\u201d\n\nThe kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Bill told her. \u201cJust a moment.\u201d\n\nShe backed out and he closed the door again.\n\n\u201cThen I have to say this,\u201d Bill went on. \u201cIf you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones.\u201d\n\nHarry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about a different breed of being,\u201d said Bill. \u201cDealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries \u2014 but you\u2019ll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership.\u201d\n\n\u201cI respect \u2014\u201d Harry began, but Bill shook his head.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if it was bought \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook\u2019s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft.\u201d\n\nHarry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was letting on.\n\n\u201cAll I am saying,\u201d said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, \u201cis to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry as Bill opened the door, \u201cyeah. Thanks. I\u2019ll bear that in mind.\u201d\n\nAs he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter26": "GRINGOTTS\n\n\n\n\nTheir plans were made, their preparations complete; in the smallest bedroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked from the sweater Hermione had been wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be using her actual wand,\u201d said Harry, nodding toward the walnut wand, \u201cso I reckon you\u2019ll be pretty convincing.\u201d\n\nHermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite her as she picked it up.\n\n\u201cI hate this thing,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI really hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn\u2019t work properly for me. . . . It\u2019s like a bit of her.\u201d\n\nHarry could not help but remember how Hermione had dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however; the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably help you get in character, though,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThink what that wand\u2019s done!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s my point!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThis is the wand that tortured Neville\u2019s mum and dad, and who knows how many other people? This is the wand that killed Sirius!\u201d\n\nHarry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor\u2019s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him.\n\n\u201cI miss my wand,\u201d Hermione said miserably. \u201cI wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me another one too.\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily.\n\nHarry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased, to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione\u2019s had done. Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione\u2019s problem was: She had not won the walnut wand\u2019s allegiance by taking it personally from Bellatrix.\n\nThe door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at once: He could tell that the goblin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We\u2019ve told Bill and Fleur we\u2019re leaving tomorrow, and we\u2019ve told them not to get up to see us off.\u201d\n\nThey had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform into Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be returning. As they had lost Perkins\u2019s old tent on the night that the Snatchers caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was now packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down her sock.\n\nThough he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of Shell Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor\u2019s sword remained a question to which Harry had no answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than five minutes at a time: \u201cHe could give my mother lessons,\u201d growled Ron, as the goblin\u2019s long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors. With Bill\u2019s warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery. Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it; Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wing it, mate.\u201d\n\nHarry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early hours, he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry did not speak.\n\nIt was a relief when six o\u2019clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May. Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff: He was going to miss the sound.\n\nSmall green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby\u2019s grave now; in a year\u2019s time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf\u2019s name had already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. His fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, through which he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore\u2019s eye. Then the sound of a door opening made him look around.\n\nBellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione through Bellatrix\u2019s low voice.\n\n\u201cShe tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, but remember, I don\u2019t like the beard too long \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake, this isn\u2019t about looking handsome \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you did last time.\u201d\n\nHermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of Ron\u2019s appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Hermione, \u201chow does he look, Harry?\u201d\n\nIt was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew him so well. Ron\u2019s hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s not my type, but he\u2019ll do,\u201d said Harry. \u201cShall we go, then?\u201d\n\nAll three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook spoke.\n\n\u201cI should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?\u201d\n\nHarry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked in front of Harry\u2019s throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both.\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said, bending down to check Harry\u2019s feet. \u201cI can\u2019t see a thing. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nHarry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry\u2019s feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn\u2019s existence.\n\nThe bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the stooped and toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows.\n\n\u201cMadam Lestrange,\u201d murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed he inclined his head subserviently.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised.\n\n\u201cToo polite,\u201d Harry whispered in Hermione\u2019s ear as they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard. \u201cYou need to treat people like they\u2019re scum!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay!\u201d\n\nHermione drew out Bellatrix\u2019s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon Alley.\n\nIt was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit. Harry\u2019s own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE.\n\nA number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them moaning to the few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were really wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over his eye.\n\nAs they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. They seemed to melt away before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path.\n\n\u201cMy children!\u201d he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-pitched; he sounded distraught. \u201cWhere are my children? What has he done with them? You know, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I really \u2014\u201d stammered Hermione.\n\nThe man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene.\n\nTheir entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them.\n\n\u201cWhy, Madam Lestrange!\u201d\n\nHarry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry\u2019s neck: A tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Travers,\u201d hissed the goblin into Harry\u2019s ear, but at that moment Harry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to her fullest height and said with as much contempt as she could muster:\n\n\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d\n\nTravers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s another Death Eater!\u201d breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into Hermione\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cI merely sought to greet you,\u201d said Travers coolly, \u201cbut if my presence is not welcome . . .\u201d\n\nHarry recognized his voice now; Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cNo, no, not at all, Travers,\u201d said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her mistake. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Why?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Travers coughed, \u201cI heard that the inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house, after the . . . ah . . . escape.\u201d\n\nHarry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public \u2014\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,\u201d said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix\u2019s most contemptuous manner. \u201cPerhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is, Travers.\u201d\n\nThough the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious. He glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned.\n\n\u201cHow did it offend you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does not matter, it will not do so again,\u201d said Hermione coolly.\n\n\u201cSome of these wandless can be troublesome,\u201d said Travers. \u201cWhile they do nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case at the Ministry last week. \u2018I\u2019m a witch, sir, I\u2019m a witch, let me prove it to you!\u2019\u201d he said in a squeaky impersonation. \u201cAs if I was going to give her my wand \u2014 but whose wand,\u201d said Travers curiously, \u201care you using at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have my wand here,\u201d said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix\u2019s wand. \u201cI don\u2019t know what rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed.\u201d\n\nTravers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron.\n\n\u201cWho is your friend? I do not recognize him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Dragomir Despard,\u201d said Hermione; they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume. \u201cHe speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord\u2019s aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed? How do you do, Dragomir?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Ow you?\u201d said Ron, holding out his hand.\n\nTravers extended two fingers and shook Ron\u2019s hand as though frightened of dirtying himself.\n\n\u201cSo what brings you and your \u2014 ah \u2014 sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?\u201d asked Travers.\n\n\u201cI need to visit Gringotts,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cAlas, I also,\u201d said Travers. \u201cGold, filthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends.\u201d\n\nHarry felt Griphook\u2019s clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck.\n\n\u201cShall we?\u201d said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward.\n\nHermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed.\n\nA watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with Travers marching at what he believed to be Bellatrix\u2019s side, there was no means for Harry to communicate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods.\n\n\u201cAh, Probity Probes,\u201d sighed Travers theatrically, \u201cso crude \u2014 but effective!\u201d\n\nAnd he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds, Harry pointed Draco\u2019s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured, \u201cConfundo\u201d twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them.\n\nHermione\u2019s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps.\n\n\u201cOne moment, madam,\u201d said the guard, raising his Probe.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve just done that!\u201d said Hermione in Bellatrix\u2019s commanding, arrogant voice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice,\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve just checked them, Marius.\u201d\n\nHermione swept forward, Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold: The wizards were both scratching their heads.\n\nTwo goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-sharp memory came to him: standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, \u201cLike I said, yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it.\u201d Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal. . . . But within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank.\n\nThe long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools, serving the first customers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron.\n\nThe goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, \u201cLeprechaun,\u201d and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to him.\n\nHermione stepped forward.\n\n\u201cMadam Lestrange!\u201d said the goblin, evidently startled. \u201cDear me! How \u2014 how may I help you today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish to enter my vault,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThe old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was Travers hanging back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou have . . . identification?\u201d asked the goblin.\n\n\u201cIdentification? I \u2014 I have never been asked for identification before!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cThey know!\u201d whispered Griphook in Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cThey must have been warned there might be an impostor!\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wand will do, madam,\u201d said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix\u2019s wand had been stolen.\n\n\u201cAct now, act now,\u201d whispered Griphook in Harry\u2019s ear, \u201cthe Imperius Curse!\u201d\n\nHarry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life, \u201cImperio!\u201d\n\nA curious sensation shot down Harry\u2019s arm, a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast. The goblin took Bellatrix\u2019s wand, examined it closely, and then said, \u201cAh, you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s mine \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA new wand?\u201d said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were watching. \u201cBut how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?\u201d\n\nHarry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, \u201cImperio!\u201d once more.\n\n\u201cOh yes, I see,\u201d said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix\u2019s wand, \u201cyes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry\u2019s enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment.\n\nThe old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached.\n\n\u201cI shall need the Clankers,\u201d he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. \u201cGood, good! So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,\u201d said the old goblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight, \u201cI shall take you to your vault.\u201d\n\nHe appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open. Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion.\n\n\u201cWait \u2014 Bogrod!\u201d\n\nAnother goblin came scurrying around the counter.\n\n\u201cWe have instructions,\u201d he said with a bow to Hermione. \u201cForgive me, Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.\u201d\n\nHe whispered urgently in Bogrod\u2019s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off.\n\n\u201cI am aware of the instructions. Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault . . . Very old family . . . old clients . . . This way, please . . .\u201d\n\nAnd, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. Harry looked back at Travers, who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his decision: With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flaming torches.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in trouble; they suspect,\u201d said Harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. \u201cThey\u2019re Imperiused,\u201d he added, in response to Hermione and Ron\u2019s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. \u201cI don\u2019t think I did it strongly enough, I don\u2019t know. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse: \u201cYou need to mean them, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d asked Ron. \u201cShall we get out now, while we can?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can,\u201d said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, beyond which who knew what was happening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got this far, I say we go on,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said Griphook. \u201cSo, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no longer have the authority. But there will not be room for the wizard.\u201d\n\nHarry pointed his wand at Travers.\n\n\u201cImperio!\u201d\n\nThe wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace.\n\n\u201cWhat are you making him do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHide,\u201d said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back.\n\nWith a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurtled past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix\u2019s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it \u2014\n\nThey were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard Griphook shout, \u201cNo!\u201d but there was no braking: They zoomed through it. Water filled Harry\u2019s eyes and mouth: He could not see or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor.\n\n\u201cC-Cushioning Charm,\u201d Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to Harry\u2019s horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again. They were realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces.\n\n\u201cThe Thief\u2019s Downfall!\u201d said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back at the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. \u201cIt washes away all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are impostors in Gringotts, they have set off defenses against us!\u201d\n\nHarry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment: The Thief\u2019s Downfall seemed to have lifted the Imperius Curse.\n\n\u201cWe need him,\u201d said Griphook, \u201cwe cannot enter the vault without a Gringotts goblin. And we need the Clankers!\u201d\n\n\u201cImperio!\u201d Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools.\n\n\u201cHarry, I think I can hear people coming!\u201d said Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix\u2019s wand at the waterfall and cried, \u201cProtego!\u201d They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway.\n\n\u201cGood thinking,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLead the way, Griphook!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are we going to get out again?\u201d Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s worry about that when we have to,\u201d said Harry. He was trying to listen: He thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. \u201cGriphook, how much farther?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot far, Harry Potter, not far . . .\u201d\n\nAnd they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, but which still brought all of them to a halt.\n\nA gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The beast\u2019s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground; its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway.\n\n\u201cIt is partially blind,\u201d panted Griphook, \u201cbut even more savage for that. However, we have the means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.\u201d\n\nRon passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a loud, ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly.\n\n\u201cYou know what to do,\u201d Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \u201cIt will expect pain when it hears the noise: It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.\u201d\n\nThey advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry\u2019s skull seemed to vibrate with the din. The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guessed that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers.\n\n\u201cMake him press his hand to the door!\u201d Griphook urged Harry, who turned his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures \u2014 some with long spines, others with drooping wings \u2014 potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown.\n\n\u201cSearch, fast!\u201d said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault.\n\nHe had described Hufflepuff\u2019s cup to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did not know what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: The door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were plunged into total darkness.\n\n\u201cNo matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!\u201d said Griphook as Ron gave a shout of surprise. \u201cLight your wands, can\u2019t you? And hurry, we have very little time!\u201d\n\n\u201cLumos!\u201d\n\nHarry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam fell upon glittering jewels; he saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them.\n\n\u201cHarry, could this be \u2014 ? Aargh!\u201d\n\nHermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them.\n\n\u201cIt burned me!\u201d moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers.\n\n\u201cThey have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!\u201d said Griphook. \u201cEverything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless \u2014 and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, don\u2019t touch anything!\u201d said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.\n\n\u201cStand still, don\u2019t move!\u201d said Hermione, clutching at Ron.\n\n\u201cJust look around!\u201d said Harry. \u201cRemember, the cup\u2019s small and gold, it\u2019s got a badger engraved on it, two handles \u2014 otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw\u2019s symbol anywhere, the eagle \u2014\u201d\n\nThey directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry\u2019s wandlight passed over shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s there, it\u2019s up there!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione pointed their wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.\n\n\u201cAnd how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cAccio Cup!\u201d cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what Griphook had told them during their planning sessions.\n\n\u201cNo use, no use!\u201d snarled the goblin.\n\n\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d said Harry, glaring at the goblin. \u201cIf you want the sword, Griphook, then you\u2019ll have to help us more than \u2014 wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!\u201d\n\nHermione fumbled inside her robes, drew out the beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply.\n\n\u201cIf I can just poke the sword through a handle \u2014 but how am I going to get up there?\u201d\n\nThe shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry\u2019s face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder.\n\nThey were truly trapped now: There was no way out except through the door, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw terror in their faces.\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d said Harry as the clanking grew louder, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get up there, we\u2019ve got to get rid of it \u2014\u201d\n\nShe raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, \u201cLevicorpus.\u201d\n\nHoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled as Harry thrust the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff\u2019s cup, hooking it onto the blade.\n\n\u201cImpervius!\u201d screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from the burning metal.\n\nThen the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Hermione were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view.\n\nHarry seized Griphook\u2019s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling.\n\n\u201cLiberacorpus!\u201d yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cGet it!\u201d Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. \u201cWhere\u2019s the sword? It had the cup on it!\u201d\n\nThe clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening \u2014 it was too late \u2014\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d\n\nIt was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harry\u2019s hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of Harry\u2019s reach.\n\nThe tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword\u2019s blade, was flung into the air. The goblin still astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, and Hermione into the outer chamber.\n\nHardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry\u2019s shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, \u201cThieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!\u201d He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question.\n\nSlipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was through.\n\n\u201cStupefy!\u201d he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner.\n\nThe tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins: The wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, \u201cRelashio!\u201d\n\nThe cuffs broke open with loud bangs.\n\n\u201cThis way!\u201d Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 Harry \u2014 what are you doing?\u201d cried Hermione.\n\n\u201cGet up, climb up, come on \u2014\u201d\n\nThe dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry\u2019s foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered.\n\nWith a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never get out, it\u2019s too big!\u201d Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer force the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry\u2019s eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crashing of rock and the dragon\u2019s roars, he could only cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, \u201cDefodio!\u201d\n\nShe was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins: Harry and Ron copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage was full of the dragon\u2019s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon\u2019s fire kept their progress clear \u2014\n\nAnd then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon\u2019s brute strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings: Turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter27": "THE FINAL HIDING PLACE\n\n\n\n\nThere was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back. Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a gray-and-green map, Harry\u2019s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast\u2019s neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon\u2019s wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing.\n\nAfter five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his scar prickling. . . .\n\nHow long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges\u2019 vault? How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How quickly would they realize what had been taken? And then, when they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort would know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes. . . .\n\nThe dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air: It climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon.\n\n\u201cWhat do you reckon it\u2019s looking for?\u201d Ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d Harry bellowed back. His hands were numb with cold but he did not dare attempt to shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them, if the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back?\n\nThe sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cIs it my imagination,\u201d shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, \u201cor are we losing height?\u201d\n\nHarry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset. The landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon, and he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight.\n\nLower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes.\n\n\u201cI say we jump when it gets low enough!\u201d Harry called back to the others. \u201cStraight into the water before it realizes we\u2019re here!\u201d\n\nThey agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the dragon\u2019s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.\n\n\u201cNOW!\u201d\n\nHe slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did not seem to have noticed anything: It was already fifty feet away, swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last on a distant bank.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The lake did not seem to be deep: Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.\n\nHermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells around them.\n\nWhen he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their clothing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. They changed and then gulped down the juice.\n\n\u201cWell, on the upside,\u201d said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, \u201cwe got the Horcrux. On the downside \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 no sword,\u201d said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath.\n\n\u201cNo sword,\u201d repeated Ron. \u201cThat double-crossing little scab . . .\u201d\n\nHarry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice.\n\n\u201cAt least we can\u2019t wear it this time, that\u2019d look a bit weird hanging round our necks,\u201d said Ron, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.\n\nHermione looked across the lake to the far bank, where the dragon was still drinking.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll happen to it, do you think?\u201d she asked. \u201cWill it be all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like Hagrid,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It\u2019s us we need to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how to break this to you,\u201d said Ron, \u201cbut I think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.\u201d\n\nAll three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Harry\u2019s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do, though?\u201d said Hermione finally, hiccuping herself back to seriousness. \u201cHe\u2019ll know, won\u2019t he? You-Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll be too scared to tell him?\u201d said Ron hopefully. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll cover up \u2014\u201d\n\nThe sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron\u2019s voice were extinguished: Pain cleaved Harry\u2019s head like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him, and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. The one thing he had dreaded \u2014 but it could not be true, he could not see how . . .\n\nThe goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his.\n\n\u201cSay it again!\u201d murmured Voldemort. \u201cSay it again!\u201d\n\n\u201cM-my Lord,\u201d stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, \u201cm-my Lord . . . we t-tried t-to st-stop them. . . . Im-impostors, my Lord . . . broke \u2014 broke into the \u2014 into the Lestranges\u2019 v-vault. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cImpostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing impostors? Who were they?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was . . . it was . . . the P-Potter b-boy and t-two accomplices. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they took?\u201d he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him. \u201cTell me! What did they take?\u201d\n\n\u201cA . . . a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord . . .\u201d\n\nThe scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger\u2019s: He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, nobody had ever known: How was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret?\n\nThe Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup \u2014\n\nAlone amongst the dead he stormed up and down, and they passed before him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors to immortality \u2014 the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy \u2014\n\nBut surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men: How could Lord Voldemort not have known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated?\n\nTrue, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had thought that was because he had no body to feel, being less than ghost . . . No, surely, the rest were safe . . . The other Horcruxes must be intact. . . .\n\nBut he must know, he must be sure . . . He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin\u2019s corpse as he passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts \u2014\n\nA modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the connection, the killings had never been traced to him: The ring, surely, was safe.\n\nAnd how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was absurd. . . .\n\nAs for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had plumbed the deepest secrets of that place. . . .\n\nAnd there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection. . . .\n\nBut to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding places, he must redouble protection around each of his Horcruxes. . . . A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must undertake alone . . .\n\nWhich should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease flickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle name . . . Dumbledore might have made the connection with the Gaunts . . . Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there that he would go first. . . .\n\nThe lake, surely impossible . . . though was there a slight possibility that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage.\n\nAnd Hogwarts . . . but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle . . . To tell Snape why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn\u2019t their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?\n\nHe would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him: He would not be parted from the snake anymore . . . and he strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow. . . .\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present: He was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion into Voldemort\u2019s mind had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun.\n\n\u201cHe knows.\u201d His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort\u2019s high screams. \u201cHe knows, and he\u2019s going to check where the others are, and the last one,\u201d he was already on his feet, \u201cis at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried.\n\n\u201cBut what did you see? How do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw him find out about the cup, I \u2014 I was in his head, he\u2019s\u201d \u2014 Harry remembered the killings \u2014 \u201che\u2019s seriously angry, and scared too, he can\u2019t understand how we knew, and now he\u2019s going to check the others are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape\u2019s there, because it\u2019ll be so hard not to be seen getting in, I think he\u2019ll check that one last, but he could still be there within hours \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see where in Hogwarts it is?\u201d asked Ron, now scrambling to his feet too.\n\n\u201cNo, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn\u2019t think about exactly where it is \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, wait!\u201d cried Hermione as Ron caught up the Horcrux and Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. \u201cWe can\u2019t just go, we haven\u2019t got a plan, we need to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to get going,\u201d said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now. \u201cCan you imagine what he\u2019s going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn\u2019t safe enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how are we going to get in?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Hogsmeade,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school\u2019s like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t really fit \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be dark, no one\u2019s going to notice our feet.\u201d\n\nThe flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water: The dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two. Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter28": "THE MISSING MIRROR\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s feet touched road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second, upon landing \u2014 and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s arms, it happened.\n\nThe air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort\u2019s when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry\u2019s body, and he knew immediately that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the street, their wands aloft.\n\nHarry seized Ron\u2019s wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to Stun: Even attempting it would give away their position. One of the Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains.\n\n\u201cAccio Cloak!\u201d roared one of the Death Eaters.\n\nHarry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: The Summoning Charm had not worked on it.\n\n\u201cNot under your wrapper, then, Potter?\u201d yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm, and then to his fellows, \u201cSpread out. He\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nSix of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron, and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters\u2019 searching wands.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just leave!\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cDisapparate now!\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat idea,\u201d said Ron, but before Harry could reply a Death Eater shouted,\n\n\u201cWe know you\u2019re here, Potter, and there\u2019s no getting away! We\u2019ll find you!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were ready for us,\u201d whispered Harry. \u201cThey set up that spell to tell them we\u2019d come. I reckon they\u2019ve done something to keep us here, trap us \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about dementors?\u201d called another Death Eater. \u201cLet \u2019em have free rein, they\u2019d find him quick enough!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 an\u2019 dementors won\u2019t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter\u2019s life, not his soul. He\u2019ll be easier to kill if he\u2019s been Kissed first!\u201d\n\nThere were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors they would have to produce Patronuses, which would give them away immediately.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\nEven as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot.\n\nThe air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry\u2019s flesh. He, Ron, and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall, trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair on the air, closing in \u2014\n\nHe raised his wand: He could not, would not, suffer the Dementor\u2019s Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered, \u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d\n\nThe silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!\u201d\n\nThe dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again, and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said, \u201cPotter, in here, quick!\u201d\n\nHe obeyed without hesitation: The three of them hurtled through the open doorway.\n\n\u201cUpstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!\u201d muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into the street and slamming the door behind him.\n\nHarry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust-strewn bar of the Hog\u2019s Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of vacant sweetness.\n\nShouts reached them from the street below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak, they crept toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog\u2019s Head\u2019s barman, was the only person not wearing a hood.\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. \u201cSo what? You send dementors down my street, I\u2019ll send a Patronus back at \u2019em! I\u2019m not having \u2019em near me, I\u2019ve told you that, I\u2019m not having it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your Patronus!\u201d said a Death Eater. \u201cThat was a stag, it was Potter\u2019s!\u201d\n\n\u201cStag!\u201d roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. \u201cStag! You idiot \u2014 Expecto Patronum!\u201d\n\nSomething huge and horned erupted from the wand: Head down, it charged toward the High Street and out of sight.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I saw \u2014\u201d said the Death Eater, though with less certainty.\n\n\u201cCurfew\u2019s been broken, you heard the noise,\u201d one of his companions told the barman. \u201cSomeone was out in the street against regulations \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou set off the Caterwauling Charm?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven\u2019t pressed your little Dark Marks and summoned him. He\u2019s not going to like being called here for me and my old cat, is he, now?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about us,\u201d said one of the Death Eaters, \u201cworry about yourself, breaking curfew!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my pub\u2019s closed down? What\u2019ll happen to your little sidelines then?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you threatening \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI keep my mouth shut, it\u2019s why you come here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI still say I saw a stag Patronus!\u201d shouted the first Death Eater.\n\n\u201cStag?\u201d roared the barman. \u201cIt\u2019s a goat, idiot!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, we made a mistake,\u201d said the second Death Eater. \u201cBreak curfew again and we won\u2019t be so lenient!\u201d\n\nThe Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains tight shut, then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.\n\nHarry\u2019s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl.\n\nThe barman entered the room.\n\n\u201cYou bloody fools,\u201d he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. \u201cWhat were you thinking, coming here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe can\u2019t thank you enough. You saved our lives.\u201d\n\nThe barman grunted. Harry approached him, looking up into the face, trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair and beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your eye I\u2019ve been seeing in the mirror.\u201d\n\nThere was silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other.\n\n\u201cYou sent Dobby.\u201d\n\nThe barman nodded and looked around for the elf.\n\n\u201cThought he\u2019d be with you. Where\u2019ve you left him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBellatrix Lestrange killed him.\u201d\n\nThe barman\u2019s face was impassive. After a few moments he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.\u201d\n\nHe turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Aberforth,\u201d said Harry to the man\u2019s back.\n\nHe neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire.\n\n\u201cHow did you get this?\u201d Harry asked, walking across to Sirius\u2019s mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.\n\n\u201cBought it from Dung \u2019bout a year ago,\u201d said Aberforth. \u201cAlbus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.\u201d\n\nRon gasped.\n\n\u201cThe silver doe!\u201d he said excitedly. \u201cWas that you too?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Aberforth.\n\n\u201cSomeone sent a doe Patronus to us!\u201d\n\n\u201cBrains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven\u2019t I just proved my Patronus is a goat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYeah . . . well, I\u2019m hungry!\u201d he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.\n\n\u201cI got food,\u201d said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the fire, the clink of goblets, and the sound of chewing.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill, and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. \u201cWe need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can\u2019t be done by night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm\u2019s set off, they\u2019ll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don\u2019t reckon I\u2019ll be able to pass off a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you\u2019ll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He\u2019s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe need to get into Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, boy,\u201d said Aberforth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Aberforth, leaning forward, \u201cis to get as far from here as you can.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. There isn\u2019t much time. We\u2019ve got to get into the castle. Dumbledore \u2014 I mean, your brother \u2014 wanted us \u2014\u201d\n\nThe firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth\u2019s glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog.\n\n\u201cMy brother Albus wanted a lot of things,\u201d said Aberforth, \u201cand people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He\u2019s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don\u2019t owe him anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Harry again.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t I?\u201d said Aberforth quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I understood my own brother? Think you knew Albus better than I did?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . he left me a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he now?\u201d said Aberforth. \u201cNice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you\u2019d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?\u201d\n\nRon gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained.\n\n\u201cI-it\u2019s not easy, no,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Got to\u2019? Why \u2018got to\u2019? He\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Aberforth roughly. \u201cLet it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014\u201d Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. \u201cBut you\u2019re fighting too, you\u2019re in the Order of the Phoenix \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d said Aberforth. \u201cThe Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who\u2019s won, it\u2019s over, and anyone who\u2019s pretending different\u2019s kidding themselves. It\u2019ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.\u201d He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. \u201cThey\u2019ll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they\u2019ve been working with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it to someone else!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?\u201d\n\nHarry wanted with all his heart to say \u201cYes,\u201d but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips. Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking.\n\n\u201cI knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother\u2019s knee. Secrets and lies, that\u2019s how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was a natural.\u201d\n\nThe old man\u2019s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else.\n\n\u201cMr. Dumbledore?\u201d said Hermione rather timidly. \u201cIs that your sister? Ariana?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Aberforth tersely. \u201cBeen reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?\u201d\n\nEven by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red.\n\n\u201cElphias Doge mentioned her to us,\u201d said Harry, trying to spare Hermione.\n\n\u201cThat old berk,\u201d muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. \u201cThought the sun shone out of my brother\u2019s every orifice, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.\u201d\n\nHarry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby\u2019s grave, he had decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth\u2019s gaze, which was so strikingly like his brother\u2019s: The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,\u201d said Hermione in a low voice.\n\n\u201cDid he now?\u201d said Aberforth. \u201cFunny thing, how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he\u2019d left \u2019em well alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Hermione breathlessly.\n\n\u201cNever you mind,\u201d said Aberforth.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s a really serious thing to say!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAre you \u2014 are you talking about your sister?\u201d\n\nAberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.\n\n\u201cWhen my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by three Muggle boys. They\u2019d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn\u2019t control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn\u2019t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain.\n\n\u201cIt destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn\u2019t use magic, but she couldn\u2019t get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn\u2019t control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless.\n\n\u201cAnd my father went after the bastards that did it,\u201d said Aberforth, \u201cand attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he\u2019d done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she\u2019d have been locked up in St. Mungo\u2019s for good. They\u2019d have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn\u2019t keep it in any longer.\n\n\u201cWe had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy.\n\n\u201cI was her favorite,\u201d he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth\u2019s wrinkles and tangled beard. \u201cNot Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with \u2018the most notable magical names of the day,\u2019\u201d Aberforth sneered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn\u2019t do it for my mother, I could get her to calm down when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.\n\n\u201cThen, when she was fourteen . . . See, I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d said Aberforth. \u201cIf I\u2019d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn\u2019t as young as she was, and . . . it was an accident. Ariana couldn\u2019t control it. But my mother was killed.\u201d\n\nHarry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it.\n\n\u201cSo that put paid to Albus\u2019s trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of \u2019em came home for my mother\u2019s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!\u201d\n\nAberforth spat into the fire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn\u2019t care about school, I\u2019d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my education and he\u2019d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there\u2019s no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.\u201d\n\nAnd now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cGrindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order, and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl got neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good?\n\n\u201cBut after a few weeks of it, I\u2019d had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go back to Hogwarts, so I told \u2019em, both of \u2019em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,\u201d and Aberforth looked down at Harry, and it took little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. \u201cI told him, you\u2019d better give it up now. You can\u2019t move her, she\u2019s in no fit state, you can\u2019t take her with you, wherever it is you\u2019re planning to go, when you\u2019re making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn\u2019t like that,\u201d said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the firelight on the lenses of his glasses: They shone white and blind again. \u201cGrindelwald didn\u2019t like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother . . . Didn\u2019t I understand, my poor sister wouldn\u2019t have to be hidden once they\u2019d changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place?\n\n\u201cAnd there was an argument . . . and I pulled out my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother\u2019s best friend \u2014 and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn\u2019t stand it \u2014\u201d\n\nThe color was draining from Aberforth\u2019s face as though he had suffered a mortal wound.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and I think she wanted to help, but she didn\u2019t really know what she was doing, and I don\u2019t know which of us did it, it could have been any of us \u2014 and she was dead.\u201d\n\nHis voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione\u2019s face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so . . . I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\n\u201cGone,\u201d croaked Aberforth. \u201cGone forever.\u201d\n\nHe wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn\u2019t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn\u2019t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was never free,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d said Aberforth.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn\u2019t there. \u2018Don\u2019t hurt them, please . . . hurt me instead.\u2019\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake: The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly.\n\n\u201cHe thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,\u201d said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whimpering, pleading. \u201cHe thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana. . . . It was torture to him, if you\u2019d seen him then, you wouldn\u2019t say he was free.\u201d\n\nAberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said, \u201cHow can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn\u2019t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren\u2019t dispensable, just like my little sister?\u201d\n\nA shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry\u2019s heart.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell him to hide, then?\u201d shot back Aberforth. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he say to him, \u2018Take care of yourself, here\u2019s how to survive\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said Harry before Hermione could answer, \u201csometimes you\u2019ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you\u2019ve got to think about the greater good! This is war!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seventeen, boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of age, and I\u2019m going to keep fighting even if you\u2019ve given up!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho says I\u2019ve given up?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018The Order of the Phoenix is finished,\u2019\u201d Harry repeated. \u201c\u2018You-Know-Who\u2019s won, it\u2019s over, and anyone who\u2019s pretending different\u2019s kidding themselves.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say I like it, but it\u2019s the truth!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYour brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I\u2019m going to keep going until I succeed \u2014 or I die. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know how this might end. I\u2019ve known it for years.\u201d\n\nHe waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely scowled.\n\n\u201cWe need to get into Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry again. \u201cIf you can\u2019t help us, we\u2019ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us \u2014 well, now would be a great time to mention it.\u201d\n\nAberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily like his brother\u2019s. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana.\n\n\u201cYou know what to do,\u201d he said.\n\nShe smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, out of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 what \u2014 ?\u201d began Ron.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one way in now,\u201d said Aberforth. \u201cYou must know they\u2019ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies . . . well, that\u2019s your lookout, isn\u2019t it? You say you\u2019re prepared to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what . . . ?\u201d said Hermione, frowning at Ariana\u2019s picture.\n\nA tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen it: He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swung forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, \u201cI knew you\u2019d come! I knew it, Harry!\u201d"}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter29": "THE LOST DIADEM\n\n\n\n\nNeville \u2014 what the \u2014 how \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, \u201cI knew you\u2019d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time!\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville, what\u2019s happened to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? This?\u201d Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. \u201cThis is nothing. Seamus is worse. You\u2019ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,\u201d he turned to Aberforth, \u201cAb, there might be a couple more people on the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouple more?\u201d repeated Aberforth ominously. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There\u2019s a curfew and a Caterwauling Charm on the whole village!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, that\u2019s why they\u2019ll be Apparating directly into the bar,\u201d said Neville. \u201cJust send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.\u201d\n\nNeville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you. You\u2019ve saved our lives twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook after \u2019em, then,\u201d said Aberforth gruffly. \u201cI might not be able to save \u2019em a third time.\u201d\n\nHarry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana\u2019s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked as though the passageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall.\n\n\u201cHow long\u2019s this been here?\u201d Ron asked as they set off. \u201cIt isn\u2019t on the Marauder\u2019s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey sealed off all of those before the start of the year,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.\u201d He started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. \u201cNever mind that stuff . . . Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It\u2019s everywhere, everyone\u2019s talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s true,\u201d said Harry.\n\nNeville laughed gleefully.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do with the dragon?\u201d\n\n\u201cReleased it into the wild,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHermione was all for keeping it as a pet \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t exaggerate, Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what have you been doing? People have been saying you\u2019ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don\u2019t think so. I think you\u2019ve been up to something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been . . . well, it\u2019s not really like Hogwarts anymore,\u201d said Neville, the smile fading from his face as he spoke. \u201cDo you know about the Carrows?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose two Death Eaters who teach here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do more than teach,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThey\u2019re in charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike Umbridge?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don\u2019t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.\n\n\u201cAmycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it\u2019s just the Dark Arts. We\u2019re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who\u2019ve earned detentions \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione\u2019s united voices echoed up and down the passage.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThat\u2019s how I got this one,\u201d he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, \u201cI refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they\u2019ve ever been top in anything, I expect.\n\n\u201cAlecto, Amycus\u2019s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We\u2019ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. I got this one,\u201d he indicated another slash to his face, \u201cfor asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, Neville,\u201d said Ron, \u201cthere\u2019s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear her,\u201d said Neville. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019ve used you as a knife sharpener,\u201d said Ron, wincing slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville\u2019s injuries were thrown into even greater relief.\n\nNeville shrugged.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t want to spill too much pure blood, so they\u2019ll torture us a bit if we\u2019re mouthy but they won\u2019t actually kill us.\u201d\n\nHarry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them.\n\n\u201cThe only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville, she\u2019s all right, we\u2019ve seen her \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.\u201d\n\nFrom his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons that Dumbledore\u2019s Army had used to send one another messages.\n\n\u201cThese have been great,\u201d said Neville, beaming at Hermione. \u201cThe Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore\u2019s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape hated it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used to?\u201d said Harry, who had noticed the past tense.\n\n\u201cWell, it got more difficult as time went on,\u201d said Neville. \u201cWe lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they\u2019d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I couldn\u2019t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That\u2019s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey what?\u201d said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, \u201cwell, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s\u2019pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,\u201d he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, \u201cthey bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn\u2019t need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,\u201d Neville laughed, \u201cDawlish is still in St. Mungo\u2019s and Gran\u2019s on the run. She sent me a letter,\u201d he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, \u201ctelling me she was proud of me, that I\u2019m my parents\u2019 son, and to keep it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Neville happily. \u201cOnly thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don\u2019t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, \u201caren\u2019t \u2014 aren\u2019t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Neville. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. We\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nThey turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana\u2019s portrait. Neville pushed it open and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out to unseen people:\n\n\u201cLook who it is! Didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d\n\nAs Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were several screams and yells: \u201cHARRY!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Potter, it\u2019s POTTER!\u201d \u201cRon!\u201d \u201cHermione!\u201d\n\nHe had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The next moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people: They might just have won a Quidditch final.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, calm down!\u201d Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to take in their surroundings.\n\nHe did not recognize the room at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship\u2019s cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wooden-cased wireless.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoom of Requirement, of course!\u201d said Neville. \u201cSurpassed itself, hasn\u2019t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn\u2019t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it\u2019s expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Carrows can\u2019t get in?\u201d asked Harry, looking around for the door.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke: Seamus\u2019s face was bruised and puffy. \u201cIt\u2019s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can\u2019t get at us, the door won\u2019t open. It\u2019s all down to Neville. He really gets this room. You\u2019ve got to ask it for exactly what you need \u2014 like, \u2018I don\u2019t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in\u2019 \u2014 and it\u2019ll do it for you! You\u2019ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! Neville\u2019s the man!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite straightforward, really,\u201d said Neville modestly. \u201cI\u2019d been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that\u2019s when the passage to the Hog\u2019s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He\u2019s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that\u2019s the one thing the room doesn\u2019t really do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, food\u2019s one of the five exceptions to Gamp\u2019s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,\u201d said Ron to general astonishment.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,\u201d said Seamus, \u201cand it just makes more hammocks every time we need them, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and thought they\u2019d quite like to wash, yes,\u201d supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner.\n\n\u201cTell us what you\u2019ve been up to, though,\u201d said Ernie. \u201cThere\u2019ve been so many rumors, we\u2019ve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.\u201d He pointed at the wireless. \u201cYou didn\u2019t break into Gringotts?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did!\u201d said Neville. \u201cAnd the dragon\u2019s true too!\u201d\n\nThere was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow.\n\n\u201cWhat were you after?\u201d asked Seamus eagerly.\n\nBefore any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort\u2019s scream of fury vibrated inside his head.\n\nWith an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort\u2019s mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up.\n\n\u201cAre you all right, Harry?\u201d Neville was saying. \u201cWant to sit down? I expect you\u2019re tired, aren\u2019t \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance.\n\n\u201cWe need to get going,\u201d he said, and their expressions told him that they understood.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do, then, Harry?\u201d asked Seamus. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlan?\u201d repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to Voldemort\u2019s rage: His scar was still burning. \u201cWell, there\u2019s something we \u2014 Ron, Hermione, and I \u2014 need to do, and then we\u2019ll get out of here.\u201d\n\nNobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, \u2018get out of here\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t come back to stay,\u201d said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the pain. \u201cThere\u2019s something important we need to do \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\nThere was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville\u2019s brows contracted.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you tell us? It\u2019s something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yeah \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll help you.\u201d\n\nThe other members of Dumbledore\u2019s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. \u201cWe \u2014 we can\u2019t tell you. We\u2019ve got to do it \u2014 alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Neville.\n\n\u201cBecause . . .\u201d In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts. His scar was still searing. \u201cDumbledore left the three of us a job,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cand we weren\u2019t supposed to tell \u2014 I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re his army,\u201d said Neville. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s Army. We were all in it together, we\u2019ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t exactly been a picnic, mate,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI never said it had, but I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t trust us. Everyone in this room\u2019s been fighting and they\u2019ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here\u2019s proven they\u2019re loyal to Dumbledore \u2014 loyal to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter: The tunnel door had just opened behind him.\n\n\u201cWe got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here!\u201d\n\nIt was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend.\n\n\u201cHi, everyone!\u201d said Luna happily. \u201cOh, it\u2019s great to be back!\u201d\n\n\u201cLuna,\u201d said Harry distractedly, \u201cwhat are you doing here? How did you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI sent for her,\u201d said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. \u201cI promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I\u2019d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course that\u2019s what it means,\u201d said Luna brightly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it, Harry? We\u2019re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d said Harry with a rising sense of panic, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not what we came back for. There\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to do, and then \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to leave us in this mess?\u201d demanded Michael Corner.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it\u2019s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let us help!\u201d said Neville angrily. \u201cWe want to be a part of it!\u201d\n\nThere was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart seemed to fail: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her.\n\n\u201cAberforth\u2019s getting a bit annoyed,\u201d said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. \u201cHe wants a kip, and his bar\u2019s turned into a railway station.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry\u2019s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him.\n\n\u201cI got the message,\u201d she said, holding up her own fake Galleon, and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan, Harry?\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t one,\u201d said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely.\n\n\u201cJust going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop this!\u201d Harry told Neville. \u201cWhat did you call them all back for? This is insane \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting, aren\u2019t we?\u201d said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. \u201cThe message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! I\u2019ll have to get a wand, though \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a wand \u2014 ?\u201d began Seamus.\n\nRon turned suddenly to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t they help?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can help.\u201d He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, who stood between them, \u201cWe don\u2019t know where it is. We\u2019ve got to find it fast. We don\u2019t have to tell them it\u2019s a Horcrux.\u201d\n\nHarry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, \u201cI think Ron\u2019s right. We don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re looking for, we need them.\u201d And when Harry looked unconvinced, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do everything alone, Harry.\u201d\n\nHarry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that\u2019s how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was a natural. . . . Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower . . .\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said quietly to the other two. \u201cOkay,\u201d he called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of them looked alert, excited.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something we need to find,\u201d Harry said. \u201cSomething \u2014 something that\u2019ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It\u2019s here at Hogwarts, but we don\u2019t know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it, for instance?\u201d\n\nHe looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny\u2019s chair.\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy\u2019s trying to duplicate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but the lost diadem,\u201d said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, \u201cis lost, Luna. That\u2019s sort of the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen was it lost?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cCenturies ago, they say,\u201d said Cho, and Harry\u2019s heart sank. \u201cProfessor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,\u201d she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws, \u201cnobody\u2019s ever found a trace of it, have they?\u201d\n\nThey all shook their heads.\n\n\u201cSorry, but what is a diadem?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of crown,\u201d said Terry Boot. \u201cRavenclaw\u2019s was supposed to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Daddy\u2019s Wrackspurt siphons \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Harry cut across Luna.\n\n\u201cAnd none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?\u201d\n\nThey all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle. . . . Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like to see what the diadem\u2019s supposed to look like, I could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry? Ravenclaw\u2019s wearing it in her statue.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he did not know: Either way, there was hardly any time left.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on the move,\u201d he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at them. \u201cListen, I know it\u2019s not much of a lead, but I\u2019m going to go and look at this statue, at least find out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you know \u2014 the other one \u2014 safe.\u201d\n\nCho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, \u201cNo, Luna will take Harry, won\u2019t you, Luna?\u201d\n\n\u201cOooh, yes, I\u2019d like to,\u201d said Luna happily, and Cho sat down again, looking disappointed.\n\n\u201cHow do we get out?\u201d Harry asked Neville.\n\n\u201cOver here.\u201d\n\nHe led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase.\n\n\u201cIt comes out somewhere different every day, so they\u2019ve never been able to find it,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly trouble is, we never know exactly where we\u2019re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they\u2019re always patrolling the corridors at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSee you in a bit.\u201d\n\nHe and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall.\n\n\u201cGet under here,\u201d Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.\n\nIt melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder\u2019s Map. Holding it close to his nose he searched, and located his and Luna\u2019s dots at last.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re up on the fifth floor,\u201d he whispered, watching Filch moving away from them, a corridor ahead. \u201cCome on, this way.\u201d\n\nThey crept off.\n\nHarry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart hammered this fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking the Marauder\u2019s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeist\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cThis way, Harry,\u201d breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase.\n\nThey climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle.\n\nLuna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird\u2019s call, a soft, musical voice said, \u201cWhich came first, the phoenix or the flame?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm . . . What do you think, Harry?\u201d said Luna, looking thoughtful.\n\n\u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t there just a password?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, you\u2019ve got to answer a question,\u201d said Luna.\n\n\u201cWhat if you get it wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,\u201d said Luna. \u201cThat way you learn, you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . Trouble is, we can\u2019t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I see what you mean,\u201d said Luna seriously. \u201cWell then, I think the answer is that a circle has no beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell reasoned,\u201d said the voice, and the door swung open.\n\nThe deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks: By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble.\n\nHarry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna\u2019s house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw\u2019s plinth to read them.\n\n\u201c\u2018Wit beyond measure is man\u2019s greatest treasure.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich makes you pretty skint, witless,\u201d said a cackling voice.\n\nHarry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter30": "THE SACKING OF SEVERUS SNAPE\n\n\n\n\nThe moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry\u2019s scar burned savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea was washing around him and there was triumph in his heart \u2014 They have the boy.\n\nA loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,\u201d said Luna, sounding mildly interested. \u201cThat was noisier than I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories: Luna\u2019s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping above.\n\n\u201cLuna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!\u201d\n\nLuna\u2019s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the common room. There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them. Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe.\n\n\u201cI think she might be dead!\u201d he shouted with delight.\n\n\u201cOh, look,\u201d whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. \u201cThey\u2019re pleased!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . great . . .\u201d\n\nHarry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort\u2019s mind . . . He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave . . . He had chosen to make sure of the locket before coming . . . but that would not take him long. . . .\n\nThere was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker: \u201cWhere do Vanished objects go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, do I? Shut it!\u201d snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of the Carrow brother, Amycus. \u201cAlecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!\u201d\n\nThe Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then, without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door.\n\n\u201cALECTO! If he comes, and we haven\u2019t got Potter \u2014 d\u2019you want to go the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!\u201d Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door.\n\n\u201cMay I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrying \u2014 to get \u2014 through this damned \u2014 door!\u201d shouted Amycus. \u201cGo and get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t your sister in there?\u201d asked Professor McGonagall. \u201cDidn\u2019t Professor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you needn\u2019t wake up half the castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do it, now!\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, if you wish it,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness. There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again,\n\n\u201cWhere do Vanished objects go?\u201d\n\n\u201cInto nonbeing, which is to say, everything,\u201d replied Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cNicely phrased,\u201d replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open.\n\nThe few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and fear.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve they done, the little whelps?\u201d he screamed. \u201cI\u2019ll Cruciate the lot of \u2019em till they tell me who did it \u2014 and what\u2019s the Dark Lord going to say?\u201d he shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got him, and they\u2019ve gorn and killed her!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s only Stunned,\u201d said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped down to examine Alecto. \u201cShe\u2019ll be perfectly all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo she bludgering well won\u2019t!\u201d bellowed Amycus. \u201cNot after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She\u2019s gorn and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we\u2019ve got Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Got Potter\u2019?\u201d said Professor McGonagall sharply. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018got Potter\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my House!\u201d\n\nBeneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.\n\n\u201cWe was told he might come in here!\u201d said Carrow. \u201cI dunno why, do I?\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna stood.\n\n\u201cWe can push it off on the kids,\u201d said Amycus, his piglike face suddenly crafty. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up there\u201d \u2014 he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019ll say they forced her to press her Mark, and that\u2019s why he got a false alarm. . . . He can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, \u201ca difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\nAmycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a case of what you\u2019ll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time\u2019s over. It\u2019s us what\u2019s in charge here now, and you\u2019ll back me up or you\u2019ll pay the price.\u201d\n\nAnd he spat in her face.\n\nHarry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\n\nAs Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, \u201cCrucio!\u201d\n\nThe Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor.\n\n\u201cI see what Bellatrix meant,\u201d said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, \u201cyou need to really mean it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. \u201cPotter \u2014 you\u2019re here! What \u2014 ? How \u2014 ?\u201d She struggled to pull herself together. \u201cPotter, that was foolish!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe spat at you,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cPotter, I \u2014 that was very \u2014 very gallant of you \u2014 but don\u2019t you realize \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. \u201cProfessor McGonagall, Voldemort\u2019s on the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are we allowed to say the name now?\u201d asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the neck of her old tartan dressing gown.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it makes any difference what we call him,\u201d Harry told Luna. \u201cHe already knows where I am.\u201d\n\nIn a distant part of Harry\u2019s brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat. . . . He had nearly reached the island where the stone basin stood. . . .\n\n\u201cYou must flee,\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall. \u201cNow, Potter, as quickly as you can!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not \u2014 hasn\u2019t it been lost for centuries?\u201d She sat up a little straighter. \u201cPotter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to,\u201d said Harry. \u201cProfessor, there\u2019s something hidden here that I\u2019m supposed to find, and it could be the diadem \u2014 if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: Amycus was coming round. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater, and said, \u201cImperio.\u201d\n\nAmycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto. Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly together.\n\n\u201cPotter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the Carrows\u2019 predicament, \u201cif He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed know that you are here \u2014\u201d\n\nAs she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting his scar on fire, and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden locket lay safe beneath the surface \u2014\n\n\u201cPotter, are you all right?\u201d said a voice, and Harry came back: He was clutching Luna\u2019s shoulder to steady himself.\n\n\u201cTime\u2019s running out, Voldemort\u2019s getting nearer. Professor, I\u2019m acting on Dumbledore\u2019s orders, I must find what he wanted me to find! But we\u2019ve got to get the students out while I\u2019m searching the castle \u2014 it\u2019s me Voldemort wants, but he won\u2019t care about killing a few more or less, not now \u2014\u201d not now he knows I\u2019m attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his head.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re acting on Dumbledore\u2019s orders?\u201d she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height.\n\n\u201cWe shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while you search for this \u2014 this object.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d said Professor McGonagall dryly, \u201cwe teachers are rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the grounds \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a way,\u201d said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the Hog\u2019s Head.\n\n\u201cPotter, we\u2019re talking about hundreds of students \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they won\u2019t be interested in anyone who\u2019s Disapparating out of the Hog\u2019s Head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something in that,\u201d she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and hoisted them into the air, where they dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures. \u201cCome. We must alert the other Heads of House. You\u2019d better put that Cloak back on.\u201d\n\nShe marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down.\n\nAlong the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them; Professor McGonagall\u2019s tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak.\n\nThey had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs. Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard them first: He felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder\u2019s Map, but before he could take it out, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their company. She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is I,\u201d said a low voice.\n\nFrom behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.\n\nHatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had forgotten the details of Snape\u2019s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight.\n\n\u201cWhere are the Carrows?\u201d he asked quietly.\n\n\u201cWherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\nSnape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up too, ready to attack.\n\n\u201cI was under the impression,\u201d said Snape, \u201cthat Alecto had apprehended an intruder.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd what gave you that impression?\u201d\n\nSnape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into his skin.\n\n\u201cOh, but naturally,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cYou Death Eaters have your own private means of communication, I forgot.\u201d\n\nSnape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing.\n\n\u201cI did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors, Minerva.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have some objection?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this late hour?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I heard a disturbance,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cReally? But all seems calm.\u201d\n\nSnape looked into her eyes.\n\n\u201cHave you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I must insist \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed: Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape \u2014\n\nThen it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast \u2014\n\n\u201cMinerva!\u201d said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no more murder at Hogwarts!\u201d\n\nFlitwick\u2019s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers: Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after him: He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, \u201cCoward! COWARD!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened, what\u2019s happened?\u201d asked Luna.\n\nHarry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were standing at a smashed window.\n\n\u201cHe jumped,\u201d said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room.\n\n\u201cYou mean he\u2019s dead?\u201d Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick\u2019s and Sprout\u2019s yells of shock at his sudden appearance.\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s not dead,\u201d said McGonagall bitterly. \u201cUnlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a wand . . . and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.\u201d\n\nWith a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.\n\nThere were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing: Slughorn had just caught up.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-green silk pajamas. \u201cMy dear boy . . . what a surprise . . . Minerva, do please explain. . . . Severus . . . what . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur headmaster is taking a short break,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window.\n\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt from it with murder in his heart \u2014\n\n\u201cProfessor, we\u2019ve got to barricade the school, he\u2019s coming now!\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,\u201d she told the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a low groan. \u201cPotter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore\u2019s orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he needs to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely?\u201d squeaked Flitwick.\n\n\u201cBut we can hold him up,\u201d said Professor Sprout.\n\n\u201cThank you, Pomona,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding. \u201cI suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. \u201cI shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.\u201d\n\nAnd as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, \u201cTentacula. Devil\u2019s Snare. And Snargaluff pods . . . yes, I\u2019d like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can act from here,\u201d said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the grounds.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d Harry said, approaching the little Charms master, \u201cProfessor, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 Protego Horribilis \u2014 the diadem of Ravenclaw?\u201d squeaked Flitwick. \u201cA little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!\u201d\n\n\u201cI only meant \u2014 do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy!\u201d\n\nHarry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the Horcrux?\n\n\u201cWe shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!\u201d said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her.\n\nThey had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech.\n\n\u201cMy word,\u201d he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver. \u201cWhat a to-do! I\u2019m not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes, also,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cIf you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cMinerva!\u201d he said, aghast.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,\u201d interrupted Professor McGonagall. \u201cGo and wake your students, Horace.\u201d\n\nHarry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and Luna ran after Professor McGonagall, who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand.\n\n\u201cPiertotum \u2014 oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, Filch, not now \u2014\u201d\n\nThe aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting, \u201cStudents out of bed! Students in the corridors!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be, you blithering idiot!\u201d shouted McGonagall. \u201cNow go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!\u201d\n\n\u201cP-Peeves?\u201d stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before.\n\n\u201cYes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven\u2019t you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once!\u201d\n\nFilch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath.\n\n\u201cAnd now \u2014 Piertotum Locomotor!\u201d cried Professor McGonagall.\n\nAnd all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same.\n\n\u201cHogwarts is threatened!\u201d shouted Professor McGonagall. \u201cMan the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!\u201d\n\nClattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry: some of them smaller, others larger, than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and spiked balls on chains.\n\n\u201cNow, Potter,\u201d said McGonagall, \u201cyou and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall \u2014 I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.\u201d\n\nThey parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna running back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and prefects.\n\n\u201cThat was Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was him, I swear, I just saw him!\u201d\n\nBut Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back down the steep staircase.\n\n\u201cWh \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nAs the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cHarry, what\u2019s happening?\u201d said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cVoldemort\u2019s on his way, they\u2019re barricading the school \u2014 Snape\u2019s run for it \u2014 What are you doing here? How did you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore\u2019s Army,\u201d Fred explained. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of snowballed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat first, Harry?\u201d called George. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re evacuating the younger kids and everyone\u2019s meeting in the Great Hall to get organized,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting.\u201d\n\nThere was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore\u2019s Army, and Harry\u2019s old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle.\n\n\u201cCome on, Luna,\u201d Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand; she took it and followed him back up the stairs.\n\nThe crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re underage!\u201d Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached. \u201cI won\u2019t permit it! The boys, yes, but you, you\u2019ve got to go home!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d\n\nGinny\u2019s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother\u2019s grip.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in Dumbledore\u2019s Army \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA teenagers\u2019 gang!\u201d\n\n\u201cA teenagers\u2019 gang that\u2019s about to take him on, which no one else has dared to do!\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sixteen!\u201d shouted Mrs. Weasley. \u201cShe\u2019s not old enough! What you two were thinking, bringing her with you \u2014\u201d\n\nFred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves.\n\n\u201cMum\u2019s right, Ginny,\u201d said Bill gently. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this. Everyone underage will have to leave, it\u2019s only right.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go home!\u201d Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. \u201cMy whole family\u2019s here, I can\u2019t stand waiting there alone and not knowing and \u2014\u201d\n\nHer eyes met Harry\u2019s for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly, but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog\u2019s Head. \u201cI\u2019ll say good-bye now, then, and \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone else had clambered out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, \u201cAm I too late? Has it started? I only just found out, so I \u2014 I \u2014\u201d\n\nPercy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent attempt to break the tension, \u201cSo \u2014 \u2019ow eez leetle Teddy?\u201d\n\nLupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to be solidifying, like ice.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 oh yes \u2014 he\u2019s fine!\u201d Lupin said loudly. \u201cYes, Tonks is with him \u2014 at her mother\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\nPercy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen.\n\n\u201cHere, I\u2019ve got a picture!\u201d Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at the camera.\n\n\u201cI was a fool!\u201d Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. \u201cI was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a \u2014 a \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMinistry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,\u201d said Fred.\n\nPercy swallowed.\n\n\u201cYes, I was!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t say fairer than that,\u201d said Fred, holding out his hand to Percy.\n\nMrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and pulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad,\u201d Percy said.\n\nMr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son.\n\n\u201cWhat made you see sense, Perce?\u201d inquired George.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been coming on for a while,\u201d said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak. \u201cBut I had to find a way out and it\u2019s not so easy at the Ministry, they\u2019re imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,\u201d said George in a good imitation of Percy\u2019s most pompous manner. \u201cNow let\u2019s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death Eaters\u2019ll be taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re my sister-in-law now?\u201d said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George.\n\n\u201cGinny!\u201d barked Mrs. Weasley.\n\nGinny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliation, to sneak upstairs too.\n\n\u201cMolly, how about this,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Ginny stay here, then at least she\u2019ll be on the scene and know what\u2019s going on, but she won\u2019t be in the middle of the fighting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Mr. Weasley firmly. \u201cGinny, you stay in this room, you hear me?\u201d\n\nGinny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father\u2019s unusually stern gaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off for the stairs as well.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Ron?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey must have gone up to the Great Hall already,\u201d Mr. Weasley called over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see them pass me,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThey said something about a bathroom,\u201d said Ginny, \u201cnot long after you left.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bathroom?\u201d\n\nHarry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure they said bath \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished: He was looking through the high wrought-iron gates with winged boars on pillars at either side, looking through the dark grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter31": "THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS\n\n\n\n\nThe enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.\n\n\u201c. . . evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madam Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and take your charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.\u201d\n\nMany of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, \u201cAnd what if we want to stay and fight?\u201d\n\nThere was a smattering of applause.\n\n\u201cIf you are of age, you may stay,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cWhat about our things?\u201d called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. \u201cOur trunks, our owls?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no time to collect possessions,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cThe important thing is to get you out of here safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Professor Snape?\u201d shouted a girl from the Slytherin table.\n\n\u201cHe has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,\u201d replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws.\n\nHarry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione. As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake.\n\n\u201cWe have already placed protection around the castle,\u201d Professor McGonagall was saying, \u201cbut it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects \u2014\u201d\n\nBut her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, cold, and clear: There was no telling from where it came; it seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for centuries.\n\n\u201cI know that you are preparing to fight.\u201d There were screams amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. \u201cYour efforts are futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood.\u201d\n\nThere was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.\n\n\u201cGive me Harry Potter,\u201d said Voldemort\u2019s voice, \u201cand none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.\n\n\u201cYou have until midnight.\u201d\n\nThe silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed, \u201cBut he\u2019s there! Potter\u2019s there! Someone grab him!\u201d\n\nBefore Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.\n\n\u201cThank you, Miss Parkinson,\u201d said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. \u201cYou will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.\u201d\n\nHarry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall.\n\n\u201cRavenclaws, follow on!\u201d cried Professor McGonagall.\n\nSlowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall\u2019s descent from the teachers\u2019 platform to chivvy the underage on their way.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!\u201d\n\nHarry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table.\n\n\u201cWhere are Ron and Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you found \u2014 ?\u201d began Mr. Weasley, looking worried.\n\nBut he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast! A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers \u2014 Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor \u2014 where they\u2019ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work spells. Meanwhile Remus\u201d \u2014 he indicated Lupin \u2014 \u201cArthur\u201d \u2014 he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the Gryffindor table \u2014 \u201cand I will take groups into the grounds. We\u2019ll need somebody to organize defense of the entrances of the passageways into the school \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like a job for us,\u201d called Fred, indicating himself and George, and Kingsley nodded his approval.\n\n\u201cAll right, leaders up here and we\u2019ll divide up the troops!\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instructions, \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be looking for something?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh,\u201d said Harry, \u201coh yeah!\u201d\n\nHe had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind.\n\n\u201cThen go, Potter, go!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight \u2014 yeah \u2014\u201d\n\nHe sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the Marauder\u2019s Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron\u2019s or Hermione\u2019s names anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate. . . .\n\nVoldemort thought I\u2019d go to Ravenclaw Tower.\n\nThere it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there could only be one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House.\n\nBut the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem . . . and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?\n\nIn living memory . . .\n\nBeneath his fingers, Harry\u2019s eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own Houses; there was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings. . . .\n\nHarry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.\n\n\u201cNick! NICK! I need to talk to you!\u201d\n\nHe forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him.\n\n\u201cHarry! My dear boy!\u201d\n\nNick made to grasp Harry\u2019s hands with both of his own: Harry\u2019s felt as though they had been thrust into icy water.\n\n\u201cNick, you\u2019ve got to help me. Who\u2019s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\u201d\n\nNearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.\n\n\u201cThe Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be her \u2014 d\u2019you know where she is?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see. . . .\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of the swarming students.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair.\u201d\n\nHarry looked in the direction of Nick\u2019s transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall.\n\nHarry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him.\n\n\u201cHey \u2014 wait \u2014 come back!\u201d\n\nShe consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. Close to, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Gray Lady?\u201d\n\nShe nodded but did not speak.\n\n\u201cThe ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is correct.\u201d\n\nHer tone was not encouraging.\n\n\u201cPlease: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem.\u201d\n\nA cold smile curved her lips.\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d she said, turning to leave, \u201cthat I cannot help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWAIT!\u201d\n\nHe had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him: It was a quarter to midnight.\n\n\u201cThis is urgent,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cIf that diadem\u2019s at Hogwarts, I\u2019ve got to find it, fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,\u201d she said disdainfully. \u201cGenerations of students have badgered me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about trying to get better marks!\u201d Harry shouted at her. \u201cIt\u2019s about Voldemort \u2014 defeating Voldemort \u2014 or aren\u2019t you interested in that?\u201d\n\nShe could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated as she replied, \u201cOf course I \u2014 how dare you suggest \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, help me, then!\u201d\n\nHer composure was slipping.\n\n\u201cIt \u2014 it is not a question of \u2014\u201d she stammered. \u201cMy mother\u2019s diadem \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother\u2019s?\u201d\n\nShe looked angry with herself.\n\n\u201cWhen I lived,\u201d she said stiffly, \u201cI was Helena Ravenclaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re her daughter? But then, you must know what happened to it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the diadem bestows wisdom,\u201d she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together, \u201cI doubt that it would greatly increase your chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I just told you, I\u2019m not interested in wearing it!\u201d Harry said fiercely. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to explain \u2014 but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you\u2019ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem!\u201d\n\nShe remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice.\n\n\u201cI stole the diadem from my mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 you did what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI stole the diadem,\u201d repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. \u201cI sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it.\u201d\n\nHe did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence, and did not ask; he simply listened, hard, as she went on:\n\n\u201cMy mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cThen my mother fell ill \u2014 fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she was desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so.\u201d\n\nHarry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.\n\n\u201cHe tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, he stabbed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Baron? You mean \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bloody Baron, yes,\u201d said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest. \u201cWhen he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence . . . as he should,\u201d she added bitterly.\n\n\u201cAnd . . . and the diadem?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cA hollow tree?\u201d repeated Harry. \u201cWhat tree? Where was this?\u201d\n\n\u201cA forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother\u2019s reach.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlbania,\u201d repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion, and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. \u201cYou\u2019ve already told someone this story, haven\u2019t you? Another student?\u201d\n\nShe closed her eyes and nodded.\n\n\u201cI had . . . no idea. . . . He was . . . flattering. He seemed to . . . to understand . . . to sympathize. . . .\u201d\n\nYes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw\u2019s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right.\n\n\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t the first person Riddle wormed things out of,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cHe could be charming when he wanted. . . .\u201d\n\nSo Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the Gray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes.\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years?\n\nBut the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that lowly tree. . . . No, the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there \u2014\n\n\u201c\u2014 the night he asked for a job!\u201d said Harry, finishing his thought.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!\u201d said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. \u201cHe must\u2019ve hidden the diadem on his way up to, or down from, Dumbledore\u2019s office! But it was still worth trying to get the job \u2014 then he might\u2019ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor\u2019s sword as well \u2014 thank you, thanks!\u201d\n\nHarry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was. . . .\n\nGenerations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that it was not in Ravenclaw Tower \u2014 but if not there, where? What hiding place had Tom Riddle discovered inside Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever?\n\nLost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at Harry.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound\u2019s attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet. \u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, yer here! Yer here!\u201d\n\nHagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to the shattered window.\n\n\u201cGood boy, Grawpy!\u201d he bellowed through the hole in the window. \u201cI\u2019ll see yer in a moment, there\u2019s a good lad!\u201d\n\nBeyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down at his watch: It was midnight. The battle had begun.\n\n\u201cBlimey, Harry,\u201d panted Hagrid, \u201cthis is it, eh? Time ter fight?\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, where have you come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,\u201d said Hagrid grimly. \u201cVoice carried, didn\u2019 it? \u2018Yeh got till midnight ter gimme Potter.\u2019 Knew yeh mus\u2019 be here, knew what mus\u2019 be happenin\u2019. Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an\u2019 Grawpy an\u2019 Fang. Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin\u2019 us, Fang an\u2019 me. Told him ter let me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exac\u2019ly what I meant, bu\u2019 \u2014 where\u2019s Ron an\u2019 Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Harry, \u201cis a really good question. Come on.\u201d\n\nThey hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them. Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around: running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re we goin\u2019?\u201d puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry\u2019s heels, making the floorboards quake.\n\n\u201cI dunno exactly,\u201d said Harry, making another random turn, \u201cbut Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . .\u201d\n\nThe first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead: The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window. Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly, \u201cOh, don\u2019t mind me . . . I\u2019ll just lie here and crumble. . . .\u201d\n\nIts ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius\u2019s house, wearing that mad headdress \u2014 and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the stone diadem upon her white curls. . . .\n\nAnd as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly stumbled.\n\nHe knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . .\n\nTom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school \u2014 here at last was a secret he and Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered \u2014\n\nHe was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.\n\n\u201cMandrakes!\u201d Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. \u201cGoing to lob them over the walls \u2014 they won\u2019t like this!\u201d\n\nHarry knew now where to go: He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each others\u2019 canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all righ\u2019, Fang \u2014 it\u2019s all righ\u2019!\u201d yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving Harry alone.\n\nHe forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony cantering behind him.\n\n\u201cBraggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!\u201d\n\nHarry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole.\n\n\u201cNice night for it!\u201d Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return them to their proper place. . . .\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d\n\nAberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, we\u2019re evacuating,\u201d Harry said, \u201cVoldemort\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 attacking because they haven\u2019t handed you over, yeah,\u201d said Aberforth, \u201cI\u2019m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you\u2019ve just sent to safety. Wouldn\u2019t it have been a bit smarter to keep \u2019em here?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t stop Voldemort,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand your brother would never have done it.\u201d\n\nAberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction.\n\nYour brother would never have done it . . . Well, it was the truth, Harry thought as he ran on again; Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom. . . .\n\nAnd then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione, both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with a broomstick under his arm.\n\n\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d Harry shouted.\n\n\u201cChamber of Secrets,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cChamber \u2014 what?\u201d said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them.\n\n\u201cIt was Ron, all Ron\u2019s idea!\u201d said Hermione breathlessly. \u201cWasn\u2019t it absolutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn\u2019t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething to get rid of Horcruxes,\u201d said Ron simply.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione\u2019s arms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk.\n\n\u201cBut how did you get in there?\u201d he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. \u201cYou need to speak Parseltongue!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did!\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cShow him, Ron!\u201d\n\nRon made a horrible strangled hissing noise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what you did to open the locket,\u201d he told Harry apologetically. \u201cI had to have a few goes to get it right, but,\u201d he shrugged modestly, \u201cwe got there in the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was amazing!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAmazing!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo . . .\u201d Harry was struggling to keep up. \u201cSo . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re another Horcrux down,\u201d said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff\u2019s cup. \u201cHermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn\u2019t had the pleasure yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenius!\u201d yelled Harry.\n\n\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. \u201cSo what\u2019s new with you?\u201d\n\nAs he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream.\n\n\u201cI know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,\u201d said Harry, talking fast. \u201cHe hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where everyone\u2019s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.\u201d\n\nAs the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks, and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as Neville\u2019s grandmother.\n\n\u201cAh, Potter,\u201d she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. \u201cYou can tell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d said Ginny and Tonks together.\n\n\u201c\u2019S far as we know,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAre there still people in the passage to the Hog\u2019s Head?\u201d\n\nHe knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it.\n\n\u201cI was the last to come through,\u201d said Mrs. Longbottom. \u201cI sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fighting,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d said the old lady proudly. \u201cExcuse me, I must go and assist him.\u201d\n\nWith surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps.\n\nHarry looked at Tonks.\n\n\u201cI thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand not knowing \u2014\u201d Tonks looked anguished. \u201cShe\u2019ll look after him \u2014 have you seen Remus?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds \u2014\u201d\n\nWithout another word, Tonks sped off.\n\n\u201cGinny,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can come back in.\u201d\n\nGinny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.\n\n\u201cAnd then you can come back in!\u201d he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come back in!\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on a moment!\u201d said Ron sharply. \u201cWe\u2019ve forgotten someone!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cThe house-elves, they\u2019ll all be down in the kitchen, won\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean we ought to get them fighting?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron seriously, \u201cI mean we should tell them to get out. We don\u2019t want any more Dobbies, do we? We can\u2019t order them to die for us \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione\u2019s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her feet.\n\n\u201cIs this the moment?\u201d Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. \u201cOI! There\u2019s a war going on here!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other.\n\n\u201cI know, mate,\u201d said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, \u201cso it\u2019s now or never, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that, what about the Horcrux?\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cD\u2019you think you could just \u2014 just hold it in until we\u2019ve got the diadem?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah \u2014 right \u2014 sorry \u2014\u201d said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face.\n\nIt was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope he steps on some of them!\u201d said Ron as more screams echoed from close by.\n\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not any of our lot!\u201d said a voice: Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below.\n\n\u201cGood girl!\u201d roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. \u201cThey look like they might be breaching the north battlements, they\u2019ve brought giants of their own!\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you seen Remus?\u201d Tonks called after him.\n\n\u201cHe was dueling Dolohov,\u201d shouted Aberforth, \u201chaven\u2019t seen him since!\u201d\n\n\u201cTonks,\u201d said Ginny, \u201cTonks, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s okay \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth.\n\nGinny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Harry, though he knew they were empty words. \u201cGinny, we\u2019ll be back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe \u2014 come on!\u201d he said to Ron and Hermione, and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant.\n\nI need the place where everything is hidden, Harry begged of it inside his head, and the door materialized on their third run past.\n\nThe furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them: All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone students.\n\n\u201cAnd he never realized anyone could get in?\u201d said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.\n\n\u201cHe thought he was the only one,\u201d said Harry. \u201cToo bad for him I\u2019ve had to hide stuff in my time . . . this way,\u201d he added, \u201cI think it\u2019s down here. . . .\u201d\n\nHe passed the stuffed troll and the Vanishing Cabinet Draco Malfoy had mended last year with such disastrous consequences, then hesitated, looking up and down aisles of junk; he could not remember where to go next. . . .\n\n\u201cAccio Diadem!\u201d cried Hermione in desperation, but nothing flew through the air toward them. It seemed that, like the vault at Gringotts, the room would not yield its hidden objects that easily.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s split up,\u201d Harry told the other two. \u201cLook for a stone bust of an old man wearing a wig and a tiara! It\u2019s standing on a cupboard and it\u2019s definitely somewhere near here. . . .\u201d\n\nThey sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others\u2019 footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats. . . .\n\n\u201cSomewhere near here,\u201d Harry muttered to himself. \u201cSomewhere . . . somewhere . . .\u201d\n\nDeeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver: There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient, discolored tiara.\n\nHe had already stretched out his hand, though he remained ten feet away, when a voice behind him said, \u201cHold it, Potter.\u201d\n\nHe skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces he saw Draco Malfoy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my wand you\u2019re holding, Potter,\u201d said Malfoy, pointing his own through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. \u201cWinners, keepers, Malfoy. Who\u2019s lent you theirs?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d said Draco.\n\nHarry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem.\n\n\u201cSo how come you three aren\u2019t with Voldemort?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be rewarded,\u201d said Crabbe: His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person; Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was smiling like a small child promised a large bag of sweets. \u201cWe \u2019ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to \u2019im.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood plan,\u201d said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out . . .\n\n\u201cSo how did you get in here?\u201d he asked, trying to distract them.\n\n\u201cI virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,\u201d said Malfoy, his voice brittle. \u201cI know how to get in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe was hiding in the corridor outside,\u201d grunted Goyle. \u201cWe can do Diss-lusion Charms now! And then,\u201d his face split into a gormless grin, \u201cyou turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a die-dum! What\u2019s a die-dum?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d Ron\u2019s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry\u2019s right. \u201cAre you talking to someone?\u201d\n\nWith a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, \u201cDescendo!\u201d\n\nThe wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where Ron stood.\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall: He pointed his wand at the rampart, cried, \u201cFinite!\u201d and it steadied.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe\u2019s arm as the latter made to repeat his spell. \u201cIf you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that matter?\u201d said Crabbe, tugging himself free. \u201cIt\u2019s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter came in here to get it,\u201d said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues, \u201cso that must mean \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Must mean\u2019?\u201d Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity. \u201cWho cares what you think? I don\u2019t take your orders no more, Draco. You an\u2019 your dad are finished.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wall. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d mimicked Crabbe. \u201cWhat\u2019s going \u2014 no, Potter! Crucio!\u201d\n\nHarry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe\u2019s curse missed him but hit the stone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested.\n\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. \u201cThe Dark Lord wants him alive \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo? I\u2019m not killing him, am I?\u201d yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy\u2019s restraining arm. \u201cBut if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what\u2019s the diff \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nA jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe\u2019s head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!\u201d\n\nHarry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy\u2019s wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and boxes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill him! DON\u2019T KILL HIM!\u201d Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second\u2019s hesitation was all Harry needed.\n\n\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d\n\nGoyle\u2019s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione\u2019s second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed.\n\nCrabbe wheeled around and screamed, \u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. The wandless Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she came.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhere here!\u201d Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. \u201cLook for it while I go and help R \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHARRY!\u201d she screamed.\n\nA roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment\u2019s warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them.\n\n\u201cLike it hot, scum?\u201d roared Crabbe as he ran.\n\nBut he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch.\n\n\u201cAguamenti!\u201d Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air.\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d\n\nMalfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge: As they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient, intent upon killing them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno.\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron, and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the heat was solid as a wall around them.\n\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d\n\nHarry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere: He swooped as low as he dared over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What a terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry, let\u2019s get out, let\u2019s get out!\u201d bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke.\n\nAnd then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 too \u2014 dangerous \u2014 !\u201d Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . .\n\nAnd he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good: Goyle was too heavy and Malfoy\u2019s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry\u2019s \u2014\n\n\u201cIF WE DIE FOR THEM, I\u2019LL KILL YOU, HARRY!\u201d roared Ron\u2019s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry.\n\n\u201cThe door, get to the door, the door!\u201d screamed Malfoy in Harry\u2019s ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discolored tiara \u2014\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, what are you doing, the door\u2019s that way!\u201d screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught it around his wrist \u2014\n\nHarry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight toward the place where, he prayed, the door stood open: Ron, Hermione, and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.\n\nMalfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious.\n\n\u201cC-Crabbe,\u201d choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. \u201cC-Crabbe . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d said Ron harshly.\n\nThere was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still going on all around him. He could hear more screams than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Ginny?\u201d he said sharply. \u201cShe was here. She was supposed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, d\u2019you reckon it\u2019ll still work after that fire?\u201d asked Ron, but he too got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. \u201cShall we split up and look \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. \u201cLet\u2019s stick together. I say we go \u2014 Harry, what\u2019s that on your arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh yeah \u2014\u201d\n\nHe pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it: WIT BEYOND MEASURE IS MAN\u2019S GREATEST TREASURE.\n\nA bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers.\n\n\u201cIt must have been Fiendfyre!\u201d whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken pieces.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cFiendfyre \u2014 cursed fire \u2014 it\u2019s one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it\u2019s so dangerous \u2014 how did Crabbe know how to \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cMust\u2019ve learned from the Carrows,\u201d said Harry grimly.\n\n\u201cShame he wasn\u2019t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,\u201d said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione\u2019s, was singed, and whose face was blackened. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t tried to kill us all, I\u2019d be quite sorry he was dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you realize?\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cThis means, if we can just get the snake \u2014\u201d\n\nBut she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor. Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked and hooded men.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast: Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair \u2014\n\n\u201cHello, Minister!\u201d bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. \u201cDid I mention I\u2019m resigning?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking, Perce!\u201d shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee.\n\n\u201cYou actually are joking, Perce. . . . I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard you joke since you were \u2014\u201d\n\nThe air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them \u2014\n\nAnd then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness: He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life. . . .\n\nAnd Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione\u2019s hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no \u2014 no!\u201d someone was shouting. \u201cNo! Fred! No!\u201d\n\nAnd Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred\u2019s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter32": "THE ELDER WAND\n\n\n\n\nThe world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the castle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down their arms? Harry\u2019s mind was in free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying \u2014\n\nAnd then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school, and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads.\n\n\u201cGet down!\u201d Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred\u2019s body, shielding it from further harm, and when Harry shouted, \u201cPercy, come on, we\u2019ve got to move!\u201d he shook his head.\n\n\u201cPercy!\u201d Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron\u2019s face as he seized his elder brother\u2019s shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. \u201cPercy, you can\u2019t do anything for him! We\u2019re going to \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall: One of Aragog\u2019s descendants had joined the fight.\n\nRon and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness.\n\n\u201cIt brought friends!\u201d Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted: More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry\u2019s head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s move, NOW!\u201d\n\nPushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred\u2019s body under the armpits. Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped; together, crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the way.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was well hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar: \u201cROOKWOOD!\u201d and sprinted off in the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students.\n\n\u201cHarry, in here!\u201d Hermione screamed.\n\nShe had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy.\n\n\u201cListen to me \u2014 LISTEN, RON!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanna help \u2014 I wanna kill Death Eaters \u2014\u201d\n\nHis face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief.\n\n\u201cRon, we\u2019re the only ones who can end it! Please \u2014 Ron \u2014 we need the snake, we\u2019ve got to kill the snake!\u201d said Hermione.\n\nBut Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not \u2014 but he could not permit that idea to form in his mind \u2014\n\n\u201cWe will fight!\u201d Hermione said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to, to reach the snake! But let\u2019s not lose sight now of what we\u2019re supposed to be d-doing! We\u2019re the only ones who can end it!\u201d\n\nShe was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry.\n\n\u201cYou need to find out where Voldemort is, because he\u2019ll have the snake with him, won\u2019t he? Do it, Harry \u2014 look inside him!\u201d\n\nWhy was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him Voldemort\u2019s thoughts? He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and the bangs and all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood far, far away from them. . . .\n\nHe was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the castle stood, but inside the room it was dark except for a solitary oil lamp.\n\nHe was rolling his wand between his fingers, watching it, his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever found, the room, like the Chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive to discover. . . . He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem . . . although Dumbledore\u2019s puppet had come much farther than he had ever expected . . . too far. . . .\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: There was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy\u2019s last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. \u201cMy Lord . . . please . . . my son . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIf your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 never,\u201d whispered Malfoy.\n\n\u201cYou must hope not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t \u2014 aren\u2019t you afraid, my Lord, that Potter might die at another hand but yours?\u201d asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be . . . forgive me . . . more prudent to call off this battle, enter the castle, and seek him y-yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not pretend, Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has happened to your son. And I do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find me.\u201d\n\nVoldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It troubled him . . . and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged. . . .\n\n\u201cGo and fetch Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape, m-my Lord?\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape. Now. I need him. There is a \u2014 service \u2014 I require from him. Go.\u201d\n\nFrightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room. Voldemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring at it.\n\n\u201cIt is the only way, Nagini,\u201d he whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between glittering cage and tank.\n\nWith a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake\u2019s with him, it\u2019s got some sort of magical protection around it. He\u2019s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort\u2019s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?\u201d said Hermione, outraged. \u201cHe\u2019s not \u2014 he\u2019s not even fighting?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think he needs to fight,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m going to go to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knows I\u2019m after Horcruxes \u2014 he\u2019s keeping Nagini close beside him \u2014 obviously I\u2019m going to have to go to him to get near the thing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron, squaring his shoulders. \u201cSo you can\u2019t go, that\u2019s what he wants, what he\u2019s expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I\u2019ll go and get it \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry cut across Ron.\n\n\u201cYou two stay here, I\u2019ll go under the Cloak and I\u2019ll be back as soon as I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cit makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Ron snarled at her.\n\nBefore Hermione could get farther than \u201cRon, I\u2019m just as capable \u2014\u201d the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood was ripped open.\n\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\n\nTwo masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted, \u201cGlisseo!\u201d\n\nThe stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters\u2019 Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall.\n\n\u201cDuro!\u201d cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.\n\n\u201cGet back!\u201d shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione flattened themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherded by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She appeared not to notice them: Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her scream, \u201cCHARGE!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you get the Cloak on,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNever mind us \u2014\u201d\n\nBut he threw it over all three of them; large though they were, he doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells.\n\nThey ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great \u201cWheeeeeeeeeeee!\u201d and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms.\n\n\u201cArgh!\u201d\n\nA fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron\u2019s head; the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s invisible there!\u201d shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing.\n\nDean made the most of the Death Eater\u2019s momentary distraction, knocking him out with a Stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted to retaliate and Parvati shot a Body-Bind Curse at him.\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S GO!\u201d Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Draco Malfoy, I\u2019m Draco, I\u2019m on your side!\u201d\n\nDraco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: Malfoy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the second time we\u2019ve saved your life tonight, you two-faced bastard!\u201d Ron yelled.\n\nThere were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall, Death Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction, some carrying or dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase: Glass shattered to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the ground, and a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its teeth into one of the fallen.\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly stirring body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move.\n\n\u201cI have more!\u201d shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters. \u201cMore for any who want them! Here \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd with a movement like a tennis serve, she heaved another enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through a window. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into the entrance hall.\n\nScreams of terror rent the air: The fighters scattered, Death Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever.\n\n\u201cHow do we get out?\u201d yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled aside: Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing his flowery pink umbrella.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurt \u2019em, don\u2019t hurt \u2019em!\u201d he yelled.\n\n\u201cHAGRID, NO!\u201d\n\nHarry forgot everything else: He sprinted out from under the Cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall.\n\n\u201cHAGRID, COME BACK!\u201d\n\nBut he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen: Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.\n\n\u201cHAGRID!\u201d\n\nHarry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care: He was sprinting down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all.\n\n\u201cHAGRID!\u201d\n\nHe thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter of the doorway.\n\n\u201cOh my \u2014 !\u201d shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people through the window above.\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T!\u201d Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione\u2019s hand as she raised her wand. \u201cStun him and he\u2019ll crush half the castle \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHAGGER?\u201d\n\nGrawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors looked around and let out a roar. The stone steps trembled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp\u2019s lopsided mouth fell open, showing yellow, half-brick-sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione\u2019s hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again.\n\nThe air around them had frozen: Harry\u2019s breath caught and solidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave toward the castle, their faces hooded and their breath rattling. . . .\n\nRon and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead. . . .\n\n\u201cCome on, Harry!\u201d said Hermione\u2019s voice from a very long way away. \u201cPatronuses, Harry, come on!\u201d\n\nHe raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading through him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about; he felt as though his soul had already half left his body. . . .\n\n\u201cHARRY, COME ON!\u201d screamed Hermione.\n\nA hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry\u2019s despair, which was like a promise of a feast. . . .\n\nHe saw Ron\u2019s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw Hermione\u2019s otter twist in midair and fade; and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling. . . .\n\nAnd then a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione\u2019s heads: The dementors fell back before the creatures\u2019 approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for the D.A. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Harry . . . come on, think of something happy. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething happy?\u201d he said, his voice cracked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all still here,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwe\u2019re still fighting. Come on, now. . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost him, the stag burst from the end of Harry\u2019s wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus, \u201cyou just saved \u2014\u201d\n\nWith a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them.\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling: They all scattered, and not a second too soon, for next moment the creature\u2019s vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing. Harry looked round: Ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished back into the battle.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of range!\u201d yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness.\n\n\u201cThe Whomping Willow,\u201d said Harry, \u201cgo!\u201d\n\nSomehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not look now: Thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it \u2014\n\nHe sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches.\n\nPanting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the Willow\u2019s swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its thick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath she could not speak.\n\n\u201cHow \u2014 how\u2019re we going to get in?\u201d panted Ron. \u201cI can \u2014 see the place \u2014 if we just had \u2014 Crookshanks again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCrookshanks?\u201d wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. \u201cAre you a wizard, or what?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 right \u2014 yeah \u2014\u201d\n\nRon looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said, \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d The twig flew up from the ground, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow\u2019s ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still.\n\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d panted Hermione.\n\n\u201cWait.\u201d\n\nFor one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come . . . Was he leading Ron and Hermione into a trap?\n\nBut then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain: The only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry, we\u2019re coming, just get in there!\u201d said Ron, pushing him forward.\n\nHarry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree\u2019s roots. It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: They had had to double up to move through it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came. They moved in silence, Harry\u2019s gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his fist.\n\nAt last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.\n\n\u201cThe Cloak!\u201d she whispered. \u201cPut the Cloak on!\u201d\n\nHe groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmured, \u201cNox,\u201d extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light.\n\nAnd then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall.\n\nThe room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirling and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. Then Snape spoke, and Harry\u2019s heart lurched: Snape was inches away from where he crouched, hidden.\n\n\u201c. . . my Lord, their resistance is crumbling \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and it is doing so without your help,\u201d said Voldemort in his high, clear voice. \u201cSkilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there . . . almost.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please.\u201d\n\nSnape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away his position. . . .\n\nVoldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly in the semidarkness.\n\n\u201cI have a problem, Severus,\u201d said Voldemort softly.\n\n\u201cMy Lord?\u201d said Snape.\n\nVoldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor\u2019s baton.\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it work for me, Severus?\u201d\n\nIn the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled \u2014 or was it Voldemort\u2019s sibilant sigh lingering on the air?\n\n\u201cMy \u2014 my Lord?\u201d said Snape blankly. \u201cI do not understand. You \u2014 you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cI have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand . . . no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.\u201d\n\nVoldemort\u2019s tone was musing, calm, but Harry\u2019s scar had begun to throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort.\n\n\u201cNo difference,\u201d said Voldemort again.\n\nSnape did not speak. Harry could not see his face: He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to reassure his master.\n\nVoldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry.\n\n\u201cI have thought long and hard, Severus. . . . Do you know why I have called you back from the battle?\u201d\n\nAnd for a moment Harry saw Snape\u2019s profile: His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage.\n\n\u201cNo, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I know his weakness, you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by one other than yourself \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy instructions to my Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends \u2014 the more, the better \u2014 but do not kill him.\n\n\u201cBut it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But \u2014 let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have told you, no!\u201d said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort\u2019s impatience in his burning scar. \u201cMy concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord, there can be no question, surely \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 but there is a question, Severus. There is.\u201d\n\nVoldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape.\n\n\u201cWhy did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I cannot answer that, my Lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry\u2019s head: He forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into Snape\u2019s pale face.\n\n\u201cMy wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another\u2019s wand. I did so, but Lucius\u2019s wand shattered upon meeting Potter\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I have no explanation, my Lord.\u201d\n\nSnape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.\n\n\u201cI sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nAnd now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape\u2019s face was like a death mask. It was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes.\n\n\u201cMy Lord \u2014 let me go to the boy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,\u201d said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper, \u201cwondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner . . . and I think I have the answer.\u201d\n\nSnape did not speak.\n\n\u201cPerhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord!\u201d Snape protested, raising his wand.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be any other way,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cI must master the wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.\u201d\n\nAnd Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been reprieved: But then Voldemort\u2019s intention became clear. The snake\u2019s cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.\n\n\u201cKill.\u201d\n\nThere was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape\u2019s face losing the little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the snake\u2019s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor.\n\n\u201cI regret it,\u201d said Voldemort coldly.\n\nHe turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere.\n\nBack in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: He had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he pulled himself up into the room.\n\nHe did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man: He did not know what he felt as he saw Snape\u2019s white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck. Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and pulled him close.\n\nA terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape\u2019s throat.\n\n\u201cTake . . . it. . . . Take . . . it. . . .\u201d\n\nSomething more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what to do \u2014\n\nA flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry\u2019s robes slackened.\n\n\u201cLook . . . at . . . me. . . .\u201d he whispered.\n\nThe green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Snape moved no more."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter33": "THE PRINCE\u2019S TALE\n\n\n\n\nHarry remained kneeling at Snape\u2019s side, simply staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to his feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room.\n\nVoldemort\u2019s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away.\n\n\u201cYou have fought,\u201d said the high, cold voice, \u201cvaliantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery.\n\n\u201cYet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste.\n\n\u201cLord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately.\n\n\u201cYou have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured.\n\n\u201cI speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.\u201d\n\nBoth Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Hermione wildly. \u201cLet\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s get back to the castle, if he\u2019s gone to the forest we\u2019ll need to think of a new plan \u2014\u201d\n\nShe glanced at Snape\u2019s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done. . . .\n\nThey crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads, as he could.\n\nYou have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest . . . One hour. . . .\n\nSmall bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could only be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog, the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of Grawp or of his attacker.\n\nThe castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters had been blown away.\n\n\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\nRon led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway.\n\nThe House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their arms around each other\u2019s necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand.\n\nThe dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred\u2019s body, because his family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred\u2019s chest, her body shaking, Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks.\n\nWithout a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an arm around Ron\u2019s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred: Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling.\n\nThe Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died. . . .\n\nHe turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks . . . He yearned not to feel . . . He wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him. . . .\n\nThe castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape\u2019s last thoughts, and he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cPassword?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore!\u201d said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside, revealing the spiral staircase behind.\n\nBut when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle, so that they could have a clear view of what was going on.\n\nHarry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore\u2019s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster\u2019s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been: Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape\u2019s memories into the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else\u2019s head would be a blessed relief. . . . Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived.\n\nHe fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt.\n\nHarry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister.\n\n\u201cLily, don\u2019t do it!\u201d shrieked the elder of the two.\n\nBut the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly.\n\n\u201cMummy told you not to!\u201d\n\nPetunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips.\n\n\u201cMummy said you weren\u2019t allowed, Lily!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Lily, still giggling. \u201cTuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.\u201d\n\nPetunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.\n\n\u201cStop it!\u201d shrieked Petunia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hurting you,\u201d said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to the ground.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower\u2019s flight to the ground and lingered upon it. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d she added, and there was definite longing in her voice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s obvious?\u201d asked Lily.\n\nSnape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, \u201cI know what you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re . . . you\u2019re a witch,\u201d whispered Snape.\n\nShe looked affronted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!\u201d\n\nShe turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older self.\n\nThe sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag.\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d said Snape to Lily. \u201cYou are a witch. I\u2019ve been watching you for a while. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. My mum\u2019s one, and I\u2019m a wizard.\u201d\n\nPetunia\u2019s laugh was like cold water.\n\n\u201cWizard!\u201d she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance. \u201cI know who you are. You\u2019re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner\u2019s End by the river,\u201d she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a poor recommendation. \u201cWhy have you been spying on us?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t been spying,\u201d said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. \u201cWouldn\u2019t spy on you, anyway,\u201d he added spitefully, \u201cyou\u2019re a Muggle.\u201d\n\nThough Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone.\n\n\u201cLily, come on, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only one left to observe him, recognized Snape\u2019s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong. . . .\n\nThe scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light.\n\n\u201c. . . and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I have done magic outside school!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all right. We haven\u2019t got wands yet. They let you off when you\u2019re a kid and you can\u2019t help it. But once you\u2019re eleven,\u201d he nodded importantly, \u201cand they start training you, then you\u2019ve got to go careful.\u201d\n\nThere was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the boy, and said, \u201cIt is real, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not a joke? Petunia says you\u2019re lying to me. Petunia says there isn\u2019t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real for us,\u201d said Snape. \u201cNot for her. But we\u2019ll get the letter, you and me.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d whispered Lily.\n\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny.\n\n\u201cAnd will it really come by owl?\u201d Lily whispered.\n\n\u201cNormally,\u201d said Snape. \u201cBut you\u2019re Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it make a difference, being Muggle-born?\u201d\n\nSnape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark red hair.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Lily, relaxing: It was clear that she had been worrying.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got loads of magic,\u201d said Snape. \u201cI saw that. All the time I was watching you . . .\u201d\n\nHis voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the playground.\n\n\u201cHow are things at your house?\u201d Lily asked.\n\nA little crease appeared between his eyes.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not arguing anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, they\u2019re arguing,\u201d said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be that long and I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t your dad like magic?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like anything, much,\u201d said Snape.\n\n\u201cSeverus?\u201d\n\nA little smile twisted Snape\u2019s mouth when she said his name.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me about the dementors again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you want to know about them for?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I use magic outside school \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You\u2019re not going to end up in Azkaban, you\u2019re too \u2014\u201d\n\nHe turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing.\n\n\u201cTuney!\u201d said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s spying now?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat d\u2019you want?\u201d\n\nPetunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something hurtful to say.\n\n\u201cWhat is that you\u2019re wearing, anyway?\u201d she said, pointing at Snape\u2019s chest. \u201cYour mum\u2019s blouse?\u201d\n\nThere was a crack: A branch over Petunia\u2019s head had fallen. Lily screamed: The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears.\n\n\u201cTuney!\u201d\n\nBut Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape.\n\n\u201cDid you make that happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d He looked both defiant and scared.\n\n\u201cYou did!\u201d She was backing away from him. \u201cYou did! You hurt her!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no I didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nBut the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused. . . .\n\nAnd the scene re-formed. Harry looked around: He was on platform nine and three-quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister; Harry moved closer to listen.\n\n\u201c. . . I\u2019m sorry, Tuney, I\u2019m sorry! Listen \u2014\u201d She caught her sister\u2019s hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away. \u201cMaybe once I\u2019m there \u2014 no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 want \u2014 to \u2014 go!\u201d said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister\u2019s grasp. \u201cYou think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a \u2014 a \u2014\u201d\n\nHer pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in their owners\u2019 arms, over the owls fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad cries after a summer apart.\n\n\u201c\u2014 you think I want to be a \u2014 a freak?\u201d\n\nLily\u2019s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a freak,\u201d said Lily. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible thing to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re going,\u201d said Petunia with relish. \u201cA special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy . . . weirdos, that\u2019s what you two are. It\u2019s good you\u2019re being separated from normal people. It\u2019s for our safety.\u201d\n\nLily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice was low and fierce.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think it was such a freak\u2019s school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you.\u201d\n\nPetunia turned scarlet.\n\n\u201cBeg? I didn\u2019t beg!\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw his reply. It was very kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have read \u2014\u201d whispered Petunia, \u201cthat was my private \u2014 how could you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nLily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. Petunia gasped.\n\n\u201cThat boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 not sneaking \u2014\u201d Now Lily was on the defensive. \u201cSeverus saw the envelope, and he couldn\u2019t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that\u2019s all! He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!\u201d said Petunia, now as pale as she had been flushed. \u201cFreak!\u201d she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood. . . .\n\nThe scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys were talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane.\n\nSnape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window. She had been crying.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you,\u201d she said in a constricted voice.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cTuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d\n\nShe threw him a look of deep dislike.\n\n\u201cSo she\u2019s my sister!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s only a \u2014\u201d He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re going!\u201d he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. \u201cThis is it! We\u2019re off to Hogwarts!\u201d\n\nShe nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better be in Slytherin,\u201d said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little.\n\n\u201cSlytherin?\u201d\n\nOne of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked.\n\n\u201cWho wants to be in Slytherin? I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile.\n\n\u201cMy whole family have been in Slytherin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said James, \u201cand I thought you seemed all right!\u201d\n\nSirius grinned.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you\u2019ve got the choice?\u201d\n\nJames lifted an invisible sword.\n\n\u201c\u2018Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!\u2019 Like my dad.\u201d\n\nSnape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him.\n\n\u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather be brawny than brainy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re you hoping to go, seeing as you\u2019re neither?\u201d interjected Sirius.\n\nJames roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in dislike.\n\n\u201cCome on, Severus, let\u2019s find another compartment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOooooo . . .\u201d\n\nJames and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed.\n\n\u201cSee ya, Snivellus!\u201d a voice called, as the compartment door slammed. . . .\n\nAnd the scene dissolved once more. . . .\n\nHarry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, \u201cEvans, Lily!\u201d\n\nHe watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, \u201cGryffindor!\u201d\n\nHarry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned her back on him.\n\nThe roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall called Snape.\n\nHarry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. \u201cSlytherin!\u201d cried the Sorting Hat.\n\nAnd Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him. . . .\n\nAnd the scene changed. . . .\n\nLily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were: A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting.\n\n\u201c. . . thought we were supposed to be friends?\u201d Snape was saying. \u201cBest friends?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are, Sev, but I don\u2019t like some of the people you\u2019re hanging round with! I\u2019m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he\u2019s creepy! D\u2019you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?\u201d\n\nLily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face.\n\n\u201cThat was nothing,\u201d said Snape. \u201cIt was a laugh, that\u2019s all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was Dark Magic, and if you think that\u2019s funny \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?\u201d demanded Snape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Potter got to do with anything?\u201d said Lily.\n\n\u201cThey sneak out at night. There\u2019s something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep going?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ill,\u201d said Lily. \u201cThey say he\u2019s ill \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery month at the full moon?\u201d said Snape.\n\n\u201cI know your theory,\u201d said Lily, and she sounded cold. \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they\u2019re doing at night?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to show you they\u2019re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.\u201d\n\nThe intensity of his gaze made her blush.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t use Dark Magic, though.\u201d She dropped her voice. \u201cAnd you\u2019re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever\u2019s down there \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s whole face contorted and he spluttered, \u201cSaved? Saved? You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his friends\u2019 too! You\u2019re not going to \u2014 I won\u2019t let you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me? Let me?\u201d\n\nLily\u2019s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2014 I just don\u2019t want to see you made a fool of \u2014 He fancies you, James Potter fancies you!\u201d The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not . . . everyone thinks . . . big Quidditch hero \u2014\u201d Snape\u2019s bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and Lily\u2019s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead.\n\n\u201cI know James Potter\u2019s an arrogant toerag,\u201d she said, cutting across Snape. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber\u2019s and Avery\u2019s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don\u2019t understand how you can be friends with them.\u201d\n\nHarry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mulciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new spring in Snape\u2019s step. . . .\n\nAnd the scene dissolved. . . .\n\nHarry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear it again . . . He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape\u2019s defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: \u201cMudblood.\u201d\n\nThe scene changed. . . .\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\n\n\u201cSave your breath.\u201d\n\nIt was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.\n\n\u201cI only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSlipped out?\u201d There was no pity in Lily\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. I\u2019ve made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends \u2014 you see, you don\u2019t even deny it! You don\u2019t even deny that\u2019s what you\u2019re all aiming to be! You can\u2019t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?\u201d\n\nHe opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t pretend anymore. You\u2019ve chosen your way, I\u2019ve chosen mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 listen, I didn\u2019t mean \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?\u201d\n\nHe struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole. . . .\n\nThe corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to re-form: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone . . . His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for \u2014\n\nThen a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air: Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill me!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was not my intention.\u201d\n\nAny sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.\n\n\u201cWell, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no message \u2014 I\u2019m here on my own account!\u201d\n\nSnape was wringing his hands: He looked a little mad, with his straggling black hair flying around him.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I come with a warning \u2014 no, a request \u2014 please \u2014\u201d\n\nDumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other.\n\n\u201cWhat request could a Death Eater make of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2014 the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . Trelawney . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHow much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything \u2014 everything I heard!\u201d said Snape. \u201cThat is why \u2014 it is for that reason \u2014 he thinks it means Lily Evans!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe prophecy did not refer to a woman,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cIt spoke of a boy born at the end of July \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down \u2014 kill them all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she means so much to you,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201csurely Lord Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have \u2014 I have asked him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou disgust me,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. \u201cYou do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They can die, as long as you have what you want?\u201d\n\nSnape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cHide them all, then,\u201d he croaked. \u201cKeep her \u2014 them \u2014 safe. Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what will you give me in return, Severus?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn \u2014 in return?\u201d Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, \u201cAnything.\u201d\n\nThe hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore\u2019s office, and something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.\n\n\u201cI thought . . . you were going . . . to keep her . . . safe. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cShe and James put their faith in the wrong person,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cRather like you, Severus. Weren\u2019t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s breathing was shallow.\n\n\u201cHer boy survives,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nWith a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly.\n\n\u201cHer son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans\u2019s eyes, I am sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T!\u201d bellowed Snape. \u201cGone . . . dead . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this remorse, Severus?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish . . . I wish I were dead. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what use would that be to anyone?\u201d said Dumbledore coldly. \u201cIf you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.\u201d\n\nSnape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore\u2019s words appeared to take a long time to reach him.\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 what do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily\u2019s son.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, \u201cVery well. Very well. But never \u2014 never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear . . . especially Potter\u2019s son . . . I want your word!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?\u201d Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape\u2019s ferocious, anguished face. \u201cIf you insist . . .\u201d\n\nThe office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in front of Dumbledore.\n\n\u201c\u2014 mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see what you expect to see, Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. \u201cOther teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.\u201d\n\nDumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, \u201cKeep an eye on Quirrell, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nA whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d murmured Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cKarkaroff\u2019s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.\u201d Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore\u2019s crooked-nosed profile. \u201cKarkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he?\u201d said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from the grounds. \u201cAnd are you tempted to join him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur\u2019s and Roger\u2019s retreating figures. \u201cI am not such a coward.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d agreed Dumbledore. \u201cYou are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon. . . .\u201d\n\nHe walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken. . . .\n\nAnd now Harry stood in the headmaster\u2019s office yet again. It was nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down Dumbledore\u2019s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore\u2019s eyelids fluttered and opened.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said Snape, without preamble, \u201cwhy did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even touch it?\u201d\n\nMarvolo Gaunt\u2019s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.\n\nDumbledore grimaced.\n\n\u201cI . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTempted by what?\u201d\n\nDumbledore did not answer.\n\n\u201cIt is a miracle you managed to return here!\u201d Snape sounded furious. \u201cThat ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being \u2014\u201d\n\nDumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio.\n\n\u201cYou have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, \u201cI cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him.\n\n\u201cI am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, buy you more time!\u201d said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. \u201cDid you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething like that . . . I was delirious, no doubt . . . .\u201d said Dumbledore. With an effort he straightened himself in his chair. \u201cWell, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.\u201d\n\nSnape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled.\n\n\u201cI refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.\u201d\n\nSnape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore\u2019s cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling, Snape said, \u201cThe Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely punishment for Lucius\u2019s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco\u2019s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNow, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?\u201d\n\nThere was a short pause.\n\n\u201cThat, I think, is the Dark Lord\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cLord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if it does fall into his grasp,\u201d said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside, \u201cI have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students of Hogwarts?\u201d\n\nSnape gave a stiff nod.\n\n\u201cGood. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept, he likes you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me, he thinks I have usurped Lucius\u2019s position.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort\u2019s wrath.\u201d\n\nSnape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, \u201cAre you intending to let him kill you?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly not. You must kill me.\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.\n\n\u201cWould you like me to do it now?\u201d asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. \u201cOr would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, not quite yet,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cI daresay the moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened tonight,\u201d he indicated his withered hand, \u201cwe can be sure that it will happen within a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind dying,\u201d said Snape roughly, \u201cwhy not let Draco do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat boy\u2019s soul is not yet so damaged,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI would not have it ripped apart on my account.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year\u2019s league. I confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved \u2014 I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play with her food before she eats it.\u201d\n\nHis tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod.\n\nDumbledore seemed satisfied.\n\n\u201cThank you, Severus . . .\u201d\n\nThe office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?\u201d Snape asked abruptly.\n\nDumbledore looked weary.\n\n\u201cWhy? You aren\u2019t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is his father over again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIn looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother\u2019s. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cInformation,\u201d repeated Snape. \u201cYou trust him . . . you do not trust me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why may I not have the same information?\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich I do on your orders!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord\u2019s mind!\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort fears that connection,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNot so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry\u2019s mind means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cLord Voldemort\u2019s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry\u2019s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSouls? We were talking of minds!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.\u201d\n\nDumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them.\n\n\u201cAfter you have killed me, Severus \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!\u201d snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face now. \u201cYou take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have changed my mind!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?\u201d\n\nSnape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed.\n\n\u201cCome to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you. . . .\u201d\n\nThey were back in Dumbledore\u2019s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking.\n\n\u201cHarry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what must he do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a time \u2014 after my death \u2014 do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Nagini?\u201d Snape looked astonished.\n\n\u201cPrecisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him what?\u201d\n\nDumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.\n\n\u201cTell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort\u2019s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building. Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort\u2019s mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.\u201d\n\nHarry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they were so far away from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears.\n\n\u201cSo the boy . . . the boy must die?\u201d asked Snape quite calmly.\n\n\u201cAnd Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.\u201d\n\nAnother long silence. Then Snape said, \u201cI thought . . . all these years . . . that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,\u201d said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. \u201cMeanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.\u201d\n\nDumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.\n\n\u201cYou have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?\u201d\n\n\u201cLately, only those whom I could not save,\u201d said Snape. He stood up. \u201cYou have used me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter\u2019s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is touching, Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore seriously. \u201cHave you grown to care for the boy, after all?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor him?\u201d shouted Snape. \u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d\n\nFrom the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.\n\n\u201cAfter all this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d said Snape.\n\nAnd the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk.\n\n\u201cYou will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry\u2019s departure from his aunt and uncle\u2019s,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNot to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry\u2019s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly . . . I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort\u2019s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows. . . .\u201d\n\nNow Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus\u2019s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration.\n\n\u201cYou will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d Snape murmured, \u201cthat they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It is the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused. . . .\n\nNow Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George. . . . A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin\u2019s back \u2014\n\n\u201cSectumsempra!\u201d shouted Snape.\n\nBut the spell, intended for the Death Eater\u2019s wand hand, missed and hit George instead \u2014\n\nAnd next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius\u2019s old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words:\n\ncould ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind\u2019s going, personally!\n\nLots of love,\n\n\n\n\n\nSnape took the page bearing Lily\u2019s signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of drawers. . . .\n\nAnd now Snape stood again in the headmaster\u2019s study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into his portrait.\n\n\u201cHeadmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not use that word!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Very good!\u201d cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster\u2019s chair. \u201cNow, Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor \u2014 and he must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry\u2019s mind and see you acting for him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cAnd you still aren\u2019t going to tell me why it\u2019s so important to give Potter the sword?\u201d said Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Dumbledore\u2019s portrait. \u201cHe will know what to do with it. And Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley\u2019s mishap \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape turned at the door.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dumbledore,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cI have a plan. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the carpeted floor in exactly the same room: Snape might just have closed the door."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter34": "THE FOREST AGAIN\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death\u2019s welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort\u2019s remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across Voldemort\u2019s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric\u2019s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither could survive.\n\nHe felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest?\n\nTerror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he had never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had always been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying.\n\nIf he could only have died on that summer\u2019s night when he had left number four, Privet Drive, for the last time, when the noble phoenix-feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved. . . . He envied even his parents\u2019 deaths now. This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits on the walls were all empty.\n\nSlowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes.\n\nDumbledore\u2019s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never questioned his own assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort.\n\nAnd Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn\u2019t he? Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind\u2019s eye, and for a moment he could hardly breathe: Death was impatient. . . .\n\nBut Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The snake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it . . . Ron and Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course. . . . That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in two others . . . so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on. . . .\n\nLike rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die. It must end.\n\nRon and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no explanations, he was determined of that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed.\n\nHe stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime\u2019s beats before the end. He did not look back as he closed the office door.\n\nThe castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were crammed.\n\nHarry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he reached the front doors easily.\n\nThen Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was tiny in death.\n\n\u201cYou know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,\u201d said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman\u2019s lift and carried him into the Great Hall.\n\nNeville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off down the steps again into the darkness to recover more bodies.\n\nHarry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this.\n\nHe moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see whether he could do what he must.\n\nHarry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body.\n\n\u201cNeville.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!\u201d\n\nHarry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going, alone?\u201d Neville asked suspiciously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the plan,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve got to do. Listen \u2014 Neville \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Neville looked suddenly scared. \u201cHarry, you\u2019re not thinking of handing yourself over?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry lied easily. \u201c\u2019Course not . . . this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort\u2019s snake, Neville? He\u2019s got a huge snake. . . . Calls it Nagini . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard, yeah. . . . What about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they \u2014\u201d\n\nThe awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together again: This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry\u2019s place: There would still be three in the secret.\n\n\u201cJust in case they\u2019re \u2014 busy \u2014 and you get the chance \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKill the snake?\u201d\n\n\u201cKill the snake,\u201d Harry repeated.\n\n\u201cAll right, Harry. You\u2019re okay, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thanks, Neville.\u201d\n\nBut Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I \u2014\u201d\n\nThe suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for more bodies.\n\nHarry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else was moving not far away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he realized it was Ginny.\n\nHe stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Ginny was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019re going to get you inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I want to go home,\u201d whispered the girl. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight anymore!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Ginny, and her voice broke. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d\n\nRipples of cold undulated over Harry\u2019s skin. He wanted to shout out to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home. . . .\n\nBut he was home. Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known. He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. . . .\n\nGinny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a huge effort Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she had sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back.\n\nHagrid\u2019s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert . . .\n\nHe moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped.\n\nA swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had no strength left for a Patronus. He could no longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. . . .\n\nThe Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he pulled it out.\n\nI open at the close.\n\nBreathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought. This was the close. This was the moment.\n\nHe pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, \u201cI am about to die.\u201d\n\nThe metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco\u2019s wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, \u201cLumos.\u201d\n\nThe black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible.\n\nAnd again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him.\n\nHe closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times.\n\nHe knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest. He opened his eyes and looked around.\n\nThey were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him, and on each face, there was the same loving smile.\n\nJames was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley\u2019s.\n\nSirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face.\n\nLupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. He looked happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings.\n\nLily\u2019s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at him enough.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been so brave.\u201d\n\nHe could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would be enough.\n\n\u201cYou are nearly there,\u201d said James. \u201cVery close. We are . . . so proud of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\n\nThe childish question had fallen from Harry\u2019s lips before he could stop it.\n\n\u201cDying? Not at all,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cQuicker and easier than falling asleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to die,\u201d Harry said. These words came without his volition. \u201cAny of you. I\u2019m sorry \u2014\u201d\n\nHe addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him.\n\n\u201c\u2014 right after you\u2019d had your son . . . Remus, I\u2019m sorry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry too,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cSorry I will never know him . . . but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.\u201d\n\nA chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at Harry\u2019s brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil the very end,\u201d said James.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to see you?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cWe are part of you,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cInvisible to anyone else.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at his mother.\n\n\u201cStay close to me,\u201d he said quietly.\n\nAnd he set off. The dementors\u2019 chill did not overcome him; he passed through it with his companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his courage, and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nHis body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort. . . .\n\nA thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too.\n\n\u201cSomeone there,\u201d came a rough whisper close at hand. \u201cHe\u2019s got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nTwo figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything.\n\n\u201cDefinitely heard something,\u201d said Yaxley. \u201cAnimal, d\u2019you reckon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,\u201d said Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder.\n\nYaxley looked down at his watch.\n\n\u201cTime\u2019s nearly up. Potter\u2019s had his hour. He\u2019s not coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he was sure he\u2019d come! He won\u2019t be happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter go back,\u201d said Yaxley. \u201cFind out what the plan is now.\u201d\n\nHe and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him, and his father nodded encouragement.\n\nThey had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarm of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause.\n\nA fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded; others showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension.\n\nEvery eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.\n\nWhen Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up.\n\n\u201cNo sign of him, my Lord,\u201d said Dolohov.\n\nVoldemort\u2019s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers.\n\n\u201cMy Lord \u2014\u201d\n\nBellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed.\n\nVoldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination.\n\n\u201cI thought he would come,\u201d said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping flames. \u201cI expected him to come.\u201d\n\nNobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. His hands were sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight.\n\n\u201cI was, it seems . . . mistaken,\u201d said Voldemort.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHarry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster: He did not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them.\n\nThe illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the fire between them.\n\nThen a voice yelled: \u201cHARRY! NO!\u201d\n\nHe turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.\n\n\u201cNO! NO! HARRY, WHAT\u2019RE YEH \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cQUIET!\u201d shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand Hagrid was silenced.\n\nBellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glittering cage behind Voldemort\u2019s head.\n\nHarry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless smile curled the lipless mouth.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the spitting fire. \u201cThe Boy Who Lived.\u201d\n\nNone of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her lips on his \u2014\n\nVoldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear \u2014\n\nHe saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone."}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter35": "KING\u2019S CROSS\n\n\n\n\nHe lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself.\n\nA long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too.\n\nAlmost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered that he had eyes.\n\nHe lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which to be.\n\nHe sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses anymore.\n\nThen a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, shameful.\n\nFor the first time, he wished he were clothed.\n\nBarely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took them and pulled them on: They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared, just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . .\n\nHe stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. . . .\n\nHarry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear, domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for \u2014\n\nHe recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for breath.\n\nHe was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him.\n\n\u201cYou cannot help.\u201d\n\nHe spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue.\n\n\u201cHarry.\u201d He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. \u201cYou wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.\u201d\n\nStunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster\u2019s face. Dumbledore\u2019s long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered it. And yet . . .\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re dead,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore matter-of-factly.\n\n\u201cThen . . . I\u2019m dead too?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. \u201cThat is the question, isn\u2019t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other, the old man still beaming.\n\n\u201cNot?\u201d repeated Harry.\n\n\u201cNot,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cBut . . .\u201d Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be there. \u201cBut I should have died \u2014 I didn\u2019t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwill, I think, have made all the difference.\u201d\n\nHappiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content.\n\n\u201cExplain,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut you already know,\u201d said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together.\n\n\u201cI let him kill me,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding. \u201cGo on!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the part of his soul that was in me . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face.\n\n\u201c. . . has it gone?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes!\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then . . .\u201d\n\nHarry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled under the chair.\n\n\u201cWhat is that, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething that is beyond either of our help,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cBut if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,\u201d Harry started again, \u201cand nobody died for me this time \u2014 how can I be alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you know,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThink back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.\u201d\n\nHarry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.\n\n\u201cHe took my blood,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cPrecisely!\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily\u2019s protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!\u201d\n\n\u201cI live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?\u201d\n\nHe was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again.\n\n\u201cAre you sure we can\u2019t do anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no help possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen explain . . . more,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled.\n\n\u201cYou were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived.\n\n\u201cAnd his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children\u2019s tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.\n\n\u201cHe took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort\u2019s one last hope for himself.\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.\n\n\u201cAnd you knew this? You knew \u2014 all along?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,\u201d said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs to that, I cannot be sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave a guess, then,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted it or explained it to Voldemort.\n\n\u201cWithout meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother\u2019s sacrifice into himself. If he could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . . But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all.\n\n\u201cHaving ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was twin of his, had never expected.\n\n\u201cHe was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their masters.\n\n\u201cI believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort\u2019s wand that night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius\u2019s wand had ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of Voldemort\u2019s own deadly skill: What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy\u2019s stand?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I am sure,\u201d Dumbledore finished kindly.\n\nHarry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things like time, here.\n\n\u201cHe killed me with your wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe failed to kill you with my wand,\u201d Dumbledore corrected Harry. \u201cI think we can agree that you are not dead \u2014 though, of course,\u201d he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, \u201cI do not minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel great at the moment, though,\u201d said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. \u201cWhere are we, exactly?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I was going to ask you that,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking around. \u201cWhere would you say that we are?\u201d\n\nUntil Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an answer ready to give.\n\n\u201cIt looks,\u201d he said slowly, \u201clike King\u2019s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing\u2019s Cross station!\u201d Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. \u201cGood gracious, really?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, where do you think we are?\u201d asked Harry, a little defensively.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.\u201d\n\nHarry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location.\n\n\u201cThe Deathly Hallows,\u201d he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from Dumbledore\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said. He even looked a little worried.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\nFor the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d he said. \u201cCan you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better man.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore\u2019s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes.\n\n\u201cThe Hallows, the Hallows,\u201d murmured Dumbledore. \u201cA desperate man\u2019s dream!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re real!\u201d\n\n\u201cReal, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd I was such a fool. But you know, don\u2019t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I know?\u201d\n\nDumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes.\n\n\u201cMaster of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you were,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOf course \u2014 how can you ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, true,\u201d said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. \u201cYet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the way he did,\u201d said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. \u201cHallows, not Horcruxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHallows,\u201d murmured Dumbledore, \u201cnot Horcruxes. Precisely.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around.\n\n\u201cGrindelwald was looking for them too?\u201d he asked.\n\nDumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded.\n\n\u201cIt was the thing, above all, that drew us together,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cTwo clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric\u2019s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cAll of it? The Peverell brothers \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 were the three brothers of the tale,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding. \u201cOh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death\u2019s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.\n\n\u201cThe Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus\u2019s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric\u2019s Hollow.\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled at Harry.\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!\u201d\n\nHis tone was unbearably bitter.\n\n\u201cThe Cloak wouldn\u2019t have helped them survive, though,\u201d Harry said quickly. \u201cVoldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn\u2019t have made them curse-proof.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d sighed Dumbledore. \u201cTrue.\u201d\n\nHarry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t despise you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you should,\u201d said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. \u201cYou know the secret of my sister\u2019s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana.\n\n\u201cI resented it, Harry.\u201d\n\nDumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry\u2019s head, into the distance.\n\n\u201cI was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory.\n\n\u201cDo not misunderstand me,\u201d he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again. \u201cI loved them. I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine.\n\n\u201cSo that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then, of course, he came. . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore looked directly into Harry\u2019s eyes again.\n\n\u201cGrindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.\n\n\u201cOh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true.\n\n\u201cAnd at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection Stone \u2014 to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders.\n\n\u201cAnd the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean \u2018invincible.\u2019\n\n\u201cInvincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me.\n\n\u201cAnd then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow.\n\n\u201cThe argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother\u2019s care and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.\u201d\n\nDumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control.\n\n\u201cWell, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame.\n\n\u201cYears passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!\u201d burst out Harry.\n\n\u201cWould I?\u201d asked Dumbledore heavily. \u201cI am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.\n\n\u201cI was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were the best \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him.\n\n\u201cOh, not death,\u201d said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry\u2019s questioning look. \u201cNot what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: You would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life.\n\n\u201cI think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could.\n\n\u201cWell, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.\u201d\n\nAnother silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry.\n\nThey sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore.\n\nAt last he said, \u201cGrindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.\u201d\n\nDumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose.\n\n\u201cThey say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?\u201d suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes.\n\nAfter another short pause Harry said, \u201cYou tried to use the Resurrection Stone.\u201d\n\nDumbledore nodded.\n\n\u201cWhen I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts \u2014 the Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons \u2014 I lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I was. . . .\n\n\u201cI was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt was natural! You wanted to see them again. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it.\n\n\u201cBut the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace, rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows.\u201d\n\nDumbledore patted Harry\u2019s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain angry with Dumbledore now?\n\n\u201cWhy did you have to make it so difficult?\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s smile was tremulous.\n\n\u201cI am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you expected him to go after the wand?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort\u2019s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI admit that was my intention,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cbut it did not work as I intended, did it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat bit didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nThe creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in the long minutes, like softly falling snow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go back, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is up to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a choice?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes.\u201d Dumbledore smiled at him. \u201cWe are in King\u2019s Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let\u2019s say . . . board a train.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd where would it take me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn,\u201d said Dumbledore simply.\n\nSilence again.\n\n\u201cVoldemort\u2019s got the Elder Wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you want me to go back?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cthat if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.\n\n\u201cDo not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they looked for a long moment into each other\u2019s faces.\n\n\u201cTell me one last thing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIs this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?\u201d\n\nDumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry\u2019s ears even though the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure.\n\n\u201cOf course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\u201d"}
{"7-Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-chapter36": "THE FLAW IN THE PLAN\n\n\n\n\nHe was lying facedown on the ground again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses, which had been knocked sideways by the fall, cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where the Killing Curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping.\n\nHe had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air.\n\n\u201cMy Lord . . . my Lord . . .\u201d\n\nIt was Bellatrix\u2019s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight.\n\n\u201cMy Lord . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Voldemort\u2019s voice.\n\nMore footsteps: Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a millimeter.\n\nVoldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside Voldemort.\n\nHarry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had fallen briefly unconscious and both of them had now returned. . . .\n\n\u201cMy Lord, let me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not require assistance,\u201d said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. \u201cThe boy . . . Is he dead?\u201d\n\nThere was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain. \u201cExamine him. Tell me whether he is dead.\u201d\n\nHarry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan. . . .\n\nHands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry\u2019s face, pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest, and felt his heart. He could hear the woman\u2019s fast breathing, her long hair tickled his face. He knew that she could feel the steady pounding of life against his ribs.\n\n\u201cIs Draco alive? Is he in the castle?\u201d\n\nThe whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch from his ear, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he breathed back.\n\nHe felt the hand on his chest contract; her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up.\n\n\u201cHe is dead!\u201d Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.\n\nAnd now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration.\n\nStill feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether Voldemort won.\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d screeched Voldemort over the tumult. \u201cHarry Potter is dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!\u201d\n\nHarry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove Voldemort\u2019s victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air: His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Voldemort, \u201cwe go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body? No \u2014 Wait \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him.\n\n\u201cYou carry him,\u201d Voldemort said. \u201cHe will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses \u2014 put on the glasses \u2014 he must be recognizable \u2014\u201d\n\nSomeone slammed Harry\u2019s glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid\u2019s arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost.\n\n\u201cMove,\u201d said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest. Branches caught at Harry\u2019s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of Harry Potter. . . .\n\nThe two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin.\n\n\u201cBANE!\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry\u2019s eyes open. \u201cHappy now, are yeh, that yeh didn\u2019 fight, yeh cowardly bunch o\u2019 nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter\u2019s \u2014 d-dead . . . ?\u201d\n\nHagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest.\n\n\u201cStop.\u201d\n\nHarry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort\u2019s command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the outer trees. They would not affect him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father\u2019s stag kept guardian in his heart.\n\nSomeone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the grounds, crashing upon Harry\u2019s eardrums.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone.\n\n\u201cThe battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman, or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build together.\u201d\n\nThere was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d sobbed Hagrid. \u201cOh, Harry . . . Harry . . .\u201d\n\nHarry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within.\n\n\u201cStop.\u201d\n\nThe Death Eaters came to a halt: Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid\u2019s arms.\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d\n\nThe scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall\u2019s despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry\u2019s death for themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini\u2019s head with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! HARRY!\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s, Hermione\u2019s, and Ginny\u2019s voices were worse than McGonagall\u2019s; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eaters, until \u2014\n\n\u201cSILENCE!\u201d cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was forced upon them all. \u201cIt is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!\u201d\n\nHarry felt himself lowered onto the grass.\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay. \u201cHarry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe beat you!\u201d yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.\n\n\u201cHe was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,\u201d said Voldemort, and there was relish in his voice for the lie, \u201ckilled while trying to save himself \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground, Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger\u2019s wand aside and laughing.\n\n\u201cAnd who is this?\u201d he said in his soft snake\u2019s hiss. \u201cWho has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?\u201d\n\nBellatrix gave a delighted laugh.\n\n\u201cIt is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes, I remember,\u201d said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected, standing in the no-man\u2019s-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. \u201cBut you are a pureblood, aren\u2019t you, my brave boy?\u201d Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists.\n\n\u201cSo what if I am?\u201d said Neville loudly.\n\n\u201cYou show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll join you when hell freezes over,\u201d said Neville. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s Army!\u201d he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort\u2019s Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. \u201cIf that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cbe it.\u201d\n\nStill watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle\u2019s shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort\u2019s hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sorting Hat.\n\n\u201cThere will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cThere will be no more Houses. The emblem, shield, and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone. Won\u2019t they, Neville Longbottom?\u201d\n\nHe pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto Neville\u2019s head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay.\n\n\u201cNeville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me,\u201d said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames.\n\nScreams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act \u2014\n\nAnd then many things happened at the same moment.\n\nThey heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled, \u201cHAGGER!\u201d His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort\u2019s giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too.\n\nIn one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle \u2014\n\nThe slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake\u2019s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort\u2019s mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake\u2019s body thudded to the ground at his feet \u2014\n\nHidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. Then, over the screams and the roars and the thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid\u2019s yell came loudest of all.\n\n\u201cHARRY!\u201d Hagrid shouted. \u201cHARRY \u2014 WHERE\u2019S HARRY?\u201d\n\nChaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants\u2019 stamping feet, and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the heads of Voldemort\u2019s giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them; and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike, were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.\n\nStill hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffeted into the entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort\u2019s would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it.\n\nAnd now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges.\n\nThe house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog\u2019s voice audible even above this din: \u201cFight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!\u201d\n\nThey were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde.\n\nBut it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past struggling prisoners, and into the Great Hall.\n\nVoldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside.\n\nHarry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a scream at Flitwick\u2019s hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback, Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.\n\nVoldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley all at once, and there was cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him \u2014\n\nBellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry\u2019s attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch \u2014\n\nHe changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways.\n\n\u201cNOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms. Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her new challenger.\n\n\u201cOUT OF MY WAY!\u201d shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley\u2019s wand slashed and twirled, and Bellatrix Lestrange\u2019s smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the witches\u2019 feet became hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. \u201cGet back! Get back! She is mine!\u201d\n\nHundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen to your children when I\u2019ve killed you?\u201d taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly\u2019s curses danced around her. \u201cWhen Mummy\u2019s gone the same way as Freddie?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 will \u2014 never \u2014 touch \u2014 our \u2014 children \u2014 again!\u201d screamed Mrs. Weasley.\n\nBellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did.\n\nMolly\u2019s curse soared beneath Bellatrix\u2019s outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.\n\nBellatrix\u2019s gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.\n\nHarry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort\u2019s fury at the fall of his last, best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.\n\n\u201cProtego!\u201d roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last.\n\nThe yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of \u201cHarry!\u201d \u201cHE\u2019S ALIVE!\u201d were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else to try to help,\u201d Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be like this. It\u2019s got to be me.\u201d\n\nVoldemort hissed.\n\n\u201cPotter doesn\u2019t mean that,\u201d he said, his red eyes wide. \u201cThat isn\u2019t how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody,\u201d said Harry simply. \u201cThere are no more Horcruxes. It\u2019s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of us?\u201d jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake that was about to strike. \u201cYou think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccident, was it, when my mother died to save me?\u201d asked Harry. They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort\u2019s. \u201cAccident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn\u2019t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccidents!\u201d screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. \u201cAccident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be killing anyone else tonight,\u201d said Harry as they circled, and stared into each other\u2019s eyes, green into red. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to kill any of them ever again. Don\u2019t you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you did not!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 I meant to, and that\u2019s what did it. I\u2019ve done what my mother did. They\u2019re protected from you. Haven\u2019t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can\u2019t torture them. You can\u2019t touch them. You don\u2019t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dare \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I dare,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI know things you don\u2019t know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don\u2019t. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?\u201d\n\nVoldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized and at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final secret. . . .\n\n\u201cIs it love again?\u201d said Voldemort, his snake\u2019s face jeering. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach, Potter \u2014 and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust one thing,\u201d said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret.\n\n\u201cIf it is not love that will save you this time,\u201d said Voldemort, \u201cyou must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe both,\u201d said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall.\n\n\u201cYou think you know more magic than I do?\u201d he said. \u201cThan I, than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he dreamed of it,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean he was weak!\u201d screamed Voldemort. \u201cToo weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he was cleverer than you,\u201d said Harry, \u201ca better wizard, a better man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought you did,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut you were wrong.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one.\n\n\u201cDumbledore is dead!\u201d Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though they would cause him unendurable pain. \u201cHis body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Dumbledore\u2019s dead,\u201d said Harry calmly, \u201cbut you didn\u2019t have him killed. He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat childish dream is this?\u201d said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did not waver from Harry\u2019s.\n\n\u201cSeverus Snape wasn\u2019t yours,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSnape was Dumbledore\u2019s, Dumbledore\u2019s from the moment you started hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you can\u2019t understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?\u201d\n\nVoldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart.\n\n\u201cSnape\u2019s Patronus was a doe,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthe same as my mother\u2019s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized,\u201d he said as he saw Voldemort\u2019s nostrils flare, \u201che asked you to spare her life, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe desired her, that was all,\u201d sneered Voldemort, \u201cbut when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he told you that,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut he was Dumbledore\u2019s spy from the moment you threatened her, and he\u2019s been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters not!\u201d shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but now let out a cackle of mad laughter. \u201cIt matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore\u2019s, or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape\u2019s supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand!\n\n\u201cDumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy \u2014 I reached the wand before you could get your hands on it, I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! Dumbledore\u2019s last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it did,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou\u2019re right. But before you try to kill me, I\u2019d advise you to think about what you\u2019ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\nOf all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your one last chance,\u201d said Harry, \u201cit\u2019s all you\u2019ve got left. . . . I\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dare \u2014 ?\u201d said Voldemort again.\n\n\u201cYes, I dare,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbecause Dumbledore\u2019s last plan hasn\u2019t backfired on me at all. It\u2019s backfired on you, Riddle.\u201d\n\nVoldemort\u2019s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco\u2019s very tightly. The moment, he knew, was seconds away.\n\n\u201cThat wand still isn\u2019t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe killed \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore\u2019s death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand\u2019s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand\u2019s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!\u201d Voldemort\u2019s voice shook with malicious pleasure. \u201cI stole the wand from its last master\u2019s tomb! I removed it against its last master\u2019s wishes! Its power is mine!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still don\u2019t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn\u2019t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn\u2019t make it really yours. Didn\u2019t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard. . . . The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world\u2019s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance. . . .\u201d\n\nVoldemort\u2019s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face.\n\n\u201cThe true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.\u201d\n\nBlank shock showed in Voldemort\u2019s face for a moment, but then it was gone.\n\n\u201cBut what does it matter?\u201d he said softly. \u201cEven if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re too late,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou\u2019ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.\u201d\n\nHarry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it.\n\n\u201cSo it all comes down to this, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d whispered Harry. \u201cDoes the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.\u201d\n\nA red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so that Voldemort\u2019s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco\u2019s wand:\n\n\u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d\n\n\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d\n\nThe bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort\u2019s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy\u2019s shell.\n\nOne shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last \u2014\n\nThe sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. . . .\n\nThey moved Voldemort\u2019s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love some,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll distract them all,\u201d she said. \u201cUse your Cloak.\u201d\n\nAnd before he could say a word she had cried, \u201cOooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!\u201d and pointed out of the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.\n\nNow he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother\u2019s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he muttered, crouching down between them. \u201cWill you come with me?\u201d\n\nThey stood up at once, and together he, Ron, and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed.\n\nSomewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition:\n\nWe did it, we bashed them, wee Potter\u2019s the one,\n\nAnd Voldy\u2019s gone moldy, so now let\u2019s have fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cReally gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through.\n\nHappiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination.\n\nSince he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster\u2019s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore.\n\n\u201cCan we go up?\u201d he asked the gargoyle.\n\n\u201cFeel free,\u201d groaned the statue.\n\nThey clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top.\n\nHe had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort \u2014\n\nBut it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other\u2019s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, \u201cAnd let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!\u201d\n\nBut Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmaster\u2019s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm as phoenix song.\n\nAt last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice.\n\n\u201cThe thing that was hidden in the Snitch,\u201d he began, \u201cI dropped it in the forest. I don\u2019t know exactly where, but I\u2019m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear boy, I do,\u201d said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. \u201cA wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep Ignotus\u2019s present, though,\u201d said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.\n\n\u201cBut of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019s this.\u201d\n\nHarry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron loudly. \u201cAre you mental?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s powerful,\u201d said Harry wearily. \u201cBut I was happier with mine. So . . .\u201d\n\nHe rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would.\n\nHe laid the broken wand upon the headmaster\u2019s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said, \u201cReparo.\u201d\n\nAs his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting the Elder Wand,\u201d he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, \u201cback where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won\u2019t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That\u2019ll be the end of it.\u201d\n\nDumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand.\n\n\u201cI think Harry\u2019s right,\u201d said Hermione quietly.\n\n\u201cThat wand\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd quite honestly,\u201d he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNINETEEN YEARS LATER\n\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\n\n\n\nNINETEEN YEARS LATER\n\n\n\n\nAutumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be long, and you\u2019ll be going too,\u201d Harry told her.\n\n\u201cTwo years,\u201d sniffed Lily. \u201cI want to go now!\u201d\n\nThe commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus\u2019s voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t! I won\u2019t be in Slytherin!\u201d\n\n\u201cJames, give it a rest!\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cI only said he might be,\u201d said James, grinning at his younger brother. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slyth \u2014\u201d\n\nBut James caught his mother\u2019s eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll write to me, won\u2019t you?\u201d Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother.\n\n\u201cEvery day, if you want us to,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cNot every day,\u201d said Albus quickly. \u201cJames says most people only get letters from home about once a month.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wrote to James three times a week last year,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\u201d Harry put in. \u201cHe likes a laugh, your brother.\u201d\n\nSide by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared.\n\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find them,\u201d said Ginny reassuringly.\n\nBut the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody\u2019s faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . .\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s them, Al,\u201d said Ginny suddenly.\n\nA group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.\n\nRose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him.\n\n\u201cParked all right, then?\u201d Ron asked Harry. \u201cI did. Hermione didn\u2019t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I\u2019d have to Confund the examiner.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cI had complete faith in you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, I did Confund him,\u201d Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus\u2019s trunk and owl onto the train. \u201cI only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let\u2019s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\u201d\n\nBack on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose\u2019s younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not in Gryffindor, we\u2019ll disinherit you,\u201d said Ron, \u201cbut no pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d\n\nLily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean it,\u201d said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry\u2019s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.\n\n\u201cLook who it is.\u201d\n\nDraco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s little Scorpius,\u201d said Ron under his breath. \u201cMake sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother\u2019s brains.\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d said Hermione, half stern, half amused. \u201cDon\u2019t try to turn them against each other before they\u2019ve even started school!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, sorry,\u201d said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \u201cDon\u2019t get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\nJames had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.\n\n\u201cTeddy\u2019s back there,\u201d he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. \u201cJust seen him! And guess what he\u2019s doing? Snogging Victoire!\u201d\n\nHe gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.\n\n\u201cOur Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked Teddy what he was doing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou interrupted them?\u201d said Ginny. \u201cYou are so like Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and he said he\u2019d come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He\u2019s snogging her!\u201d James added as though worried he had not made himself clear.\n\n\u201cOh, it would be lovely if they got married!\u201d whispered Lily ecstatically. \u201cTeddy would really be part of the family then!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe already comes round for dinner about four times a week,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d said James enthusiastically. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sharing with Al \u2014 Teddy could have my room!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry firmly, \u201cyou and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished.\u201d\n\nHe checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly eleven, you\u2019d better get on board.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to give Neville our love!\u201d Ginny told James as she hugged him.\n\n\u201cMum! I can\u2019t give a professor love!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know Neville \u2014\u201d\n\nJames rolled his eyes.\n\n\u201cOutside, yeah, but at school he\u2019s Professor Longbottom, isn\u2019t he? I can\u2019t walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .\u201d\n\nShaking his head at his mother\u2019s foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus.\n\n\u201cSee you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!\u201d\n\nBut James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.\n\n\u201cThestrals are nothing to worry about,\u201d Harry told Albus. \u201cThey\u2019re gentle things, there\u2019s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won\u2019t be going up to school in the carriages, you\u2019ll be going in the boats.\u201d\n\nGinny kissed Albus good-bye.\n\n\u201cSee you at Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye, Al,\u201d said Harry as his son hugged him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget Hagrid\u2019s invited you to tea next Friday. Don\u2019t mess with Peeves. Don\u2019t duel anyone till you\u2019ve learned how. And don\u2019t let James wind you up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I\u2019m in Slytherin?\u201d\n\nThe whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.\n\nHarry crouched down so that Albus\u2019s face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry\u2019s three children, Albus had inherited Lily\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cAlbus Severus,\u201d Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, \u201cyou were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut just say \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won\u2019t it? It doesn\u2019t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you\u2019ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did for me,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus\u2019s face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry.\n\n\u201cWhy are they all staring?\u201d demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around to look at the other students.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let it worry you,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m extremely famous.\u201d\n\nAlbus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son\u2019s thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. . . .\n\nThe last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry\u2019s hand was still raised in farewell.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d murmured Ginny.\n\nAs Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.\n\n\u201cI know he will.\u201d\n\nThe scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well."}
