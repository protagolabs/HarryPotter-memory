{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter1": "THE WORST BIRTHDAY\n\n\n\n\nNot for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cThird time this week!\u201d he roared across the table. \u201cIf you can\u2019t control that owl, it\u2019ll have to go!\u201d\n\nHarry tried, yet again, to explain.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s bored,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I look stupid?\u201d snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. \u201cI know what\u2019ll happen if that owl\u2019s let out.\u201d\n\nHe exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.\n\nHarry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys\u2019 son, Dudley.\n\n\u201cI want more bacon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more in the frying pan, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. \u201cWe must build you up while we\u2019ve got the chance. . . . I don\u2019t like the sound of that school food. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,\u201d said Uncle Vernon heartily. \u201cDudley gets enough, don\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n\nDudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.\n\n\u201cPass the frying pan.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten the magic word,\u201d said Harry irritably.\n\nThe effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples.\n\n\u201cI meant \u2018please\u2019!\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,\u201d thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, \u201cABOUT SAYING THE \u2018M\u2019 WORD IN OUR HOUSE?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.\n\n\u201cI just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!\u201d\n\nHarry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Harry, \u201call right . . .\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.\n\nEver since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn\u2019t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.\n\nHarry Potter was a wizard \u2014 a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt.\n\nHe missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the Wizarding world (six tall goalposts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).\n\nAll Harry\u2019s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn\u2019t practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry\u2019s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the Wizarding world.\n\nHarry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.\n\nIt was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry\u2019s very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys\u2019 doorstep eleven years before.\n\nAt the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry\u2019s parents had died in Voldemort\u2019s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow \u2014 nobody understood why \u2014 Voldemort\u2019s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.\n\nSo Harry had been brought up by his dead mother\u2019s sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys\u2019 story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.\n\nAnd then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous . . . but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.\n\nThe Dursleys hadn\u2019t even remembered that today happened to be Harry\u2019s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn\u2019t been high; they\u2019d never given him a real present, let alone a cake \u2014 but to ignore it completely . . .\n\nAt that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, \u201cNow, as we all know, today is a very important day.\u201d\n\nHarry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.\n\n\u201cThis could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,\u201d said Uncle Vernon.\n\nHarry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He\u2019d been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon\u2019s company made drills).\n\n\u201cI think we should run through the schedule one more time,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \u201cWe should all be in position at eight o\u2019clock. Petunia, you will be \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the lounge,\u201d said Aunt Petunia promptly, \u201cwaiting to welcome them graciously to our home.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, good. And Dudley?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting to open the door.\u201d Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. \u201cMay I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll love him!\u201d cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.\n\n\u201cExcellent, Dudley,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I\u2019m not there,\u201d said Harry tonelessly.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Uncle Vernon nastily. \u201cI will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll announce dinner,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cAnd, Dudley, you\u2019ll say \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\u201d said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.\n\n\u201cMy perfect little gentleman!\u201d sniffed Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I\u2019m not there,\u201d said Harry dully.\n\n\u201cPrecisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?\u201d\n\n\u201cVernon tells me you\u2019re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason. . . . Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect . . . Dudley?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about \u2014 \u2018We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn\u2019t see him laughing.\n\n\u201cAnd you, boy?\u201d\n\nHarry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I\u2019m not there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cToo right, you will,\u201d said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \u201cThe Masons don\u2019t know anything about you and it\u2019s going to stay that way. When dinner\u2019s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I\u2019ll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I\u2019ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. We\u2019ll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t feel too excited about this. He didn\u2019t think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.\n\n\u201cRight \u2014 I\u2019m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,\u201d he snarled at Harry. \u201cYou stay out of your aunt\u2019s way while she\u2019s cleaning.\u201d\n\nHarry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath:\n\n\u201cHappy birthday to me . . . happy birthday to me . . .\u201d\n\nNo cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn\u2019t seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay.\n\nCountless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig\u2019s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn\u2019t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren\u2019t allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn\u2019t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal \u2014 and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.\n\nWhat wouldn\u2019t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He\u2019d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn\u2019t all been a dream. . . .\n\nNot that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort\u2019s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes \u2014\n\nHarry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge \u2014 and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.\n\nHarry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.\n\n\u201cI know what day it is,\u201d sang Dudley, waddling toward him.\n\nThe huge eyes blinked and vanished.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been.\n\n\u201cI know what day it is,\u201d Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSo you\u2019ve finally learned the days of the week.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s your birthday,\u201d sneered Dudley. \u201cHow come you haven\u2019t got any cards? Haven\u2019t you even got friends at that freak place?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\u201d said Harry coolly.\n\nDudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019re you staring at the hedge?\u201d he said suspiciously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,\u201d said Harry.\n\nDudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.\n\n\u201cYou c-can\u2019t \u2014 Dad told you you\u2019re not to do m-magic \u2014 he said he\u2019ll chuck you out of the house \u2014 and you haven\u2019t got anywhere else to go \u2014 you haven\u2019t got any friends to take you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJiggery pokery!\u201d said Harry in a fierce voice. \u201cHocus pocus \u2014 squiggly wiggly \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMUUUUUUM!\u201d howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. \u201cMUUUUM! He\u2019s doing you know what!\u201d\n\nHarry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn\u2019t really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn\u2019t eat again until he\u2019d finished.\n\nWhile Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flower beds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn\u2019t have risen to Dudley\u2019s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself . . . maybe he didn\u2019t have any friends at Hogwarts. . . .\n\nWish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.\n\nIt was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.\n\n\u201cGet in here! And walk on the newspaper!\u201d\n\nHarry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight\u2019s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.\n\n\u201cEat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!\u201d snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.\n\nHarry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. \u201cUpstairs! Hurry!\u201d\n\nAs he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon\u2019s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cRemember, boy \u2014 one sound \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed.\n\nThe trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter2": "DOBBY\u2019S WARNING\n\n\n\n\nHarry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.\n\nAs they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley\u2019s voice from the hall.\n\n\u201cMay I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\u201d\n\nThe creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 hello,\u201d said Harry nervously.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. \u201cSo long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir . . . Such an honor it is. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTh-thank you,\u201d said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\u201d said the creature.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 really?\u201d said Harry. \u201cEr \u2014 I don\u2019t want to be rude or anything, but \u2014 this isn\u2019t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.\u201d\n\nAunt Petunia\u2019s high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head.\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m not pleased to meet you,\u201d said Harry quickly, \u201cbut, er, is there any particular reason you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, sir,\u201d said Dobby earnestly. \u201cDobby has come to tell you, sir . . . it is difficult, sir . . . Dobby wonders where to begin. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.\n\nTo his horror, the elf burst into tears \u2014 very noisy tears.\n\n\u201cS-sit down!\u201d he wailed. \u201cNever . . . never ever . . .\u201d\n\nHarry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend you or anything \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOffend Dobby!\u201d choked the elf. \u201cDobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard \u2014 like an equal \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry, trying to say \u201cShh!\u201d and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have met many decent wizards,\u201d said Harry, trying to cheer him up.\n\nDobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, \u201cBad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2014 what are you doing?\u201d Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed \u2014 Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.\n\n\u201cDobby had to punish himself, sir,\u201d said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed. \u201cDobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYour family?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf \u2014 bound to serve one house and one family forever. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDo they know you\u2019re here?\u201d asked Harry curiously.\n\nDobby shuddered.\n\n\u201cOh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut won\u2019t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why don\u2019t you leave? Escape?\u201d\n\n\u201cA house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby free . . . Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stared.\n\n\u201cAnd I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can\u2019t anyone help you? Can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nAlmost at once, Harry wished he hadn\u2019t spoken. Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Harry whispered frantically, \u201cplease be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you\u2019re here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \u201cWhatever you\u2019ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I\u2019m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that\u2019s Hermione, she \u2014\u201d\n\nBut he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter is humble and modest,\u201d said Dobby reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. \u201cHarry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort?\u201d said Harry.\n\nDobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, \u201cAh, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the name!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cI know lots of people don\u2019t like it. My friend Ron \u2014\u201d\n\nHe stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.\n\nDobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.\n\n\u201cDobby heard tell,\u201d he said hoarsely, \u201cthat Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped yet again.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded and Dobby\u2019s eyes suddenly shone with tears.\n\n\u201cAh, sir,\u201d he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing. \u201cHarry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later. . . . Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cW-what?\u201d Harry stammered. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to go back \u2014 term starts on September first. It\u2019s all that\u2019s keeping me going. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like here. I don\u2019t belong here. I belong in your world \u2014 at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped. \u201cHarry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry in surprise.\n\n\u201cThere is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,\u201d whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. \u201cDobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat terrible things?\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cWho\u2019s plotting them?\u201d\n\nDobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall.\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d cried Harry, grabbing the elf\u2019s arm to stop him. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?\u201d A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him. \u201cHang on \u2014 this hasn\u2019t got anything to do with Vol- \u2014 sorry \u2014 with You-Know-Who, has it? You could just shake or nod,\u201d he added hastily as Dobby\u2019s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again.\n\nSlowly, Dobby shook his head.\n\n\u201cNot \u2014 not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Dobby\u2019s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a brother, has he?\u201d\n\nDobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.\n\n\u201cWell then, I can\u2019t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s Dumbledore, for one thing \u2014 you know who Dumbledore is, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nDobby bowed his head.\n\n\u201cAlbus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore\u2019s powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir\u201d \u2014 Dobby\u2019s voice dropped to an urgent whisper \u2014 \u201cthere are powers Dumbledore doesn\u2019t . . . powers no decent wizard . . .\u201d\n\nAnd before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry\u2019s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps.\n\nA sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, \u201cDudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\u201d\n\n\u201cQuick! In the closet!\u201d hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 the \u2014 devil \u2014 are \u2014 you \u2014 doing?\u201d said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019ve just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. . . . One more sound and you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d never been born, boy!\u201d\n\nHe stomped flat-footed from the room.\n\nShaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.\n\n\u201cSee what it\u2019s like here?\u201d he said. \u201cSee why I\u2019ve got to go back to Hogwarts? It\u2019s the only place I\u2019ve got \u2014 well, I think I\u2019ve got friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriends who don\u2019t even write to Harry Potter?\u201d said Dobby slyly.\n\n\u201cI expect they\u2019ve just been \u2014 wait a minute,\u201d said Harry, frowning. \u201cHow do you know my friends haven\u2019t been writing to me?\u201d\n\nDobby shuffled his feet.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter mustn\u2019t be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you been stopping my letters?\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby has them here, sir,\u201d said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry\u2019s reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione\u2019s neat writing, Ron\u2019s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.\n\nDobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter mustn\u2019t be angry. . . . Dobby hoped . . . if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him . . . Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say you won\u2019t go back, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cGive me my friends\u2019 letters!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,\u201d said the elf sadly.\n\nBefore Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.\n\nMouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, \u201c. . . tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She\u2019s been dying to hear . . .\u201d\n\nHarry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.\n\nAunt Petunia\u2019s masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d croaked Harry. \u201cPlease . . . they\u2019ll kill me. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter must say he\u2019s not going back to school \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby . . . please . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSay it, sir \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\nDobby gave him a tragic look.\n\n\u201cThen Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter\u2019s own good.\u201d\n\nThe pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished.\n\nThere were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia\u2019s pudding.\n\nAt first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over. (\u201cJust our nephew \u2014 very disturbed \u2014 meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs. . . .\u201d) He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean.\n\nUncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal \u2014 if it hadn\u2019t been for the owl.\n\nAunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason\u2019s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke.\n\nHarry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.\n\n\u201cRead it!\u201d he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered. \u201cGo on \u2014 read it!\u201d\n\nHarry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.\n\nDear Mr. Potter,\n\nWe have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.\n\nAs you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).\n\nWe would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks\u2019 Statute of Secrecy.\n\nEnjoy your holidays!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\nMafalda Hopkirk\n\nIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE\n\nMinistry of Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry looked up from the letter and gulped.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us you weren\u2019t allowed to use magic outside school,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. \u201cForgot to mention it. . . . Slipped your mind, I daresay. . . .\u201d\n\nHe was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got news for you, boy. . . . I\u2019m locking you up. . . . You\u2019re never going back to that school . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself out \u2014 they\u2019ll expel you!\u201d\n\nAnd laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs.\n\nUncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry\u2019s window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.\n\nThree days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn\u2019t see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him.\n\nWhat was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren\u2019t going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he\u2019d probably starve to death anyway.\n\nThe cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia\u2019s hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig\u2019s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good turning your beak up at it \u2014 that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Harry grimly.\n\nHe put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup.\n\nSupposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if he didn\u2019t turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why he hadn\u2019t come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go?\n\nThe room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.\n\nHe dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby\u2019s face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, \u201cHarry Potter is safe there, sir!\u201d and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him.\n\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head. \u201cLeave me alone . . . cut it out . . . I\u2019m trying to sleep. . . .\u201d\n\nHe opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone.\n\nRon Weasley was outside Harry\u2019s window."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter3": "THE BURROW\n\n\n\n\nRon!\u201d breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars. \u201cRon, how did you \u2014 What the \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in midair. Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George, Ron\u2019s elder twin brothers.\n\n\u201cAll right, Harry?\u201d asked George.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been going on?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been answering my letters? I\u2019ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you\u2019d got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me \u2014 and how did he know?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe works for the Ministry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou know we\u2019re not supposed to do spells outside school \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should talk,\u201d said Harry, staring at the floating car.\n\n\u201cOh, this doesn\u2019t count,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019re only borrowing this. It\u2019s Dad\u2019s, we didn\u2019t enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, I didn\u2019t \u2014 but it\u2019ll take too long to explain now \u2014 look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won\u2019t let me come back, and obviously I can\u2019t magic myself out, because the Ministry\u2019ll think that\u2019s the second spell I\u2019ve done in three days, so \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop gibbering,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to take you home with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t magic me out either \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to,\u201d said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning. \u201cYou forget who I\u2019ve got with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cTie that around the bars,\u201d said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry.\n\n\u201cIf the Dursleys wake up, I\u2019m dead,\u201d said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Fred, \u201cand stand back.\u201d\n\nHarry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys\u2019 bedroom.\n\nWhen the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry\u2019s window.\n\n\u201cGet in,\u201d Ron said.\n\n\u201cBut all my Hogwarts stuff \u2014 my wand \u2014 my broomstick \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLocked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can\u2019t get out of this room \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said George from the front passenger seat. \u201cOut of the way, Harry.\u201d\n\nFred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry\u2019s room. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.\n\n\u201cA lot of wizards think it\u2019s a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick,\u201d said Fred, \u201cbut we feel they\u2019re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.\u201d\n\nThere was a small click and the door swung open.\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 we\u2019ll get your trunk \u2014 you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron,\u201d whispered George.\n\n\u201cWatch out for the bottom stair \u2014 it creaks,\u201d Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.\n\nHarry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.\n\nAt last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harry\u2019s room to the open window. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.\n\nUncle Vernon coughed again.\n\n\u201cA bit more,\u201d panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car. \u201cOne good push \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car.\n\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go,\u201d George whispered.\n\nBut as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cTHAT RUDDY OWL!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten Hedwig!\u201d\n\nHarry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on \u2014 he snatched up Hedwig\u2019s cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door \u2014 and it crashed open.\n\nFor a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle.\n\nRon, Fred, and George seized Harry\u2019s arms and pulled as hard as they could.\n\n\u201cPetunia!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon. \u201cHe\u2019s getting away! HE\u2019S GETTING AWAY!\u201d\n\nBut the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry\u2019s leg slid out of Uncle Vernon\u2019s grasp \u2014 Harry was in the car \u2014 he\u2019d slammed the door shut \u2014\n\n\u201cPut your foot down, Fred!\u201d yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon.\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe it \u2014 he was free. He rolled down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry\u2019s window.\n\n\u201cSee you next summer!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\nThe Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\u201cLet Hedwig out,\u201d he told Ron. \u201cShe can fly behind us. She hasn\u2019t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.\u201d\n\nGeorge handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost.\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 what\u2019s the story, Harry?\u201d said Ron impatiently. \u201cWhat\u2019s been happening?\u201d\n\nHarry told them all about Dobby, the warning he\u2019d given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished.\n\n\u201cVery fishy,\u201d said Fred finally.\n\n\u201cDefinitely dodgy,\u201d agreed George. \u201cSo he wouldn\u2019t even tell you who\u2019s supposed to be plotting all this stuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he could,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.\u201d\n\nHe saw Fred and George look at each other.\n\n\u201cWhat, you think he was lying to me?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Fred, \u201cput it this way \u2014 house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can\u2019t usually use it without their master\u2019s permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts. Someone\u2019s idea of a joke. Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry and Ron together, instantly.\n\n\u201cDraco Malfoy,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cHe hates me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDraco Malfoy?\u201d said George, turning around. \u201cNot Lucius Malfoy\u2019s son?\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be, it\u2019s not a very common name, is it?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard Dad talking about him,\u201d said George. \u201cHe was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when You-Know-Who disappeared,\u201d said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, \u201cLucius Malfoy came back saying he\u2019d never meant any of it. Load of dung \u2014 Dad reckons he was right in You-Know-Who\u2019s inner circle.\u201d\n\nHarry had heard these rumors about Malfoy\u2019s family before, and they didn\u2019t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family, and they\u2019ll be rich,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cYeah, Mum\u2019s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\u201d said George. \u201cBut all we\u2019ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn\u2019t catch one in our house. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we came to get you, anyway,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI was getting really worried when you didn\u2019t answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol\u2019s fault at first \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Errol?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur owl. He\u2019s ancient. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,\u201d said Fred from the front.\n\n\u201cBut Percy wouldn\u2019t lend him to me,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSaid he needed him.\u201d\n\n\u201cPercy\u2019s been acting very oddly this summer,\u201d said George, frowning. \u201cAnd he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room. . . . I mean, there\u2019s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge. . . . You\u2019re driving too far west, Fred,\u201d he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel.\n\n\u201cSo, does your dad know you\u2019ve got the car?\u201d said Harry, guessing the answer.\n\n\u201cEr, no,\u201d said Ron, \u201che had to work tonight. Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe works in the most boring department,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare \u2014 Dad was working overtime for weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was going frantic \u2014 it\u2019s only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office \u2014 and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your dad \u2014 this car \u2014\u201d\n\nFred laughed. \u201cYeah, Dad\u2019s crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed\u2019s full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he\u2019d have to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the main road,\u201d said George, peering down through the windshield. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there in ten minutes. . . . Just as well, it\u2019s getting light. . . .\u201d\n\nA faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.\n\nFred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little way outside the village,\u201d said George. \u201cOttery St. Catchpole.\u201d\n\nLower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees.\n\n\u201cTouchdown!\u201d said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron\u2019s house.\n\nIt looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which, Harry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BURROW. Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not much,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive.\n\nThey got out of the car.\n\n\u201cNow, we\u2019ll go upstairs really quietly,\u201d said Fred, \u201cand wait for Mum to call us for breakfast. Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, \u2018Mum, look who turned up in the night!\u2019 and she\u2019ll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCome on, Harry, I sleep at the \u2014 at the top \u2014\u201d\n\nRon had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The other three wheeled around.\n\nMrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d said George.\n\nMrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMorning, Mum,\u201d said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice.\n\n\u201cHave you any idea how worried I\u2019ve been?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley in a deadly whisper.\n\n\u201cSorry, Mum, but see, we had to \u2014\u201d\n\nAll three of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them.\n\n\u201cBeds empty! No note! Car gone \u2014 could have crashed \u2014 out of my mind with worry \u2014 did you care? \u2014 never, as long as I\u2019ve lived \u2014 you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect Percy,\u201d muttered Fred.\n\n\u201cYOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY\u2019S BOOK!\u201d yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred\u2019s chest. \u201cYou could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job \u2014\u201d\n\nIt seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cCome in and have some breakfast.\u201d\n\nShe turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.\n\nThe kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard house before.\n\nThe clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You\u2019re late. Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts \u2014 It\u2019s Magic! And unless Harry\u2019s ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was \u201cWitching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like \u201cdon\u2019t know what you were thinking of,\u201d and \u201cnever would have believed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame you, dear,\u201d she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. \u201cArthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we\u2019d come and get you ourselves if you hadn\u2019t written back to Ron by Friday. But really\u201d (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate), \u201cflying an illegal car halfway across the country \u2014 anyone could have seen you \u2014\u201d\n\nShe flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean themselves, clinking gently in the background.\n\n\u201cIt was cloudy, Mum!\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cYou keep your mouth closed while you\u2019re eating!\u201d Mrs. Weasley snapped.\n\n\u201cThey were starving him, Mum!\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cAnd you!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him.\n\nAt that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again.\n\n\u201cGinny,\u201d said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \u201cMy sister. She\u2019s been talking about you all summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, she\u2019ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\u201d Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother\u2019s eye and bent his face over his plate without another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time.\n\n\u201cBlimey, I\u2019m tired,\u201d yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not,\u201d snapped Mrs. Weasley. \u201cIt\u2019s your own fault you\u2019ve been up all night. You\u2019re going to de-gnome the garden for me; they\u2019re getting completely out of hand again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Mum \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you two,\u201d she said, glaring at Ron and George. \u201cYou can go up to bed, dear,\u201d she added to Harry. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask them to fly that wretched car \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \u201cI\u2019ll help Ron. I\u2019ve never seen a de-gnoming \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you, dear, but it\u2019s dull work,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cNow, let\u2019s see what Lockhart\u2019s got to say on the subject \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George groaned.\n\n\u201cMum, we know how to de-gnome a garden \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s book. Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s Guide to Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the Wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.\n\n\u201cOh, he is marvelous,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knows his household pests, all right, it\u2019s a wonderful book. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMum fancies him,\u201d said Fred, in a very audible whisper.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so ridiculous, Fred,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. \u201cAll right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there\u2019s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.\u201d\n\nYawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry\u2019s eyes, exactly what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn\u2019t have liked it \u2014 there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting \u2014 but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.\n\n\u201cMuggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\u201d Harry told Ron as they crossed the lawn.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen those things they think are gnomes,\u201d said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, \u201clike fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods. . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. \u201cThis is a gnome,\u201d he said grimly.\n\n\u201cGerroff me! Gerroff me!\u201d squealed the gnome.\n\nIt was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm\u2019s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.\n\n\u201cThis is what you have to do,\u201d he said. He raised the gnome above his head (\u201cGerroff me!\u201d) and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry\u2019s face, Ron added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt them \u2014 you\u2019ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can\u2019t find their way back to the gnomeholes.\u201d\n\nHe let go of the gnome\u2019s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.\n\n\u201cPitiful,\u201d said Fred. \u201cI bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\u201d\n\nHarry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry\u2019s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off \u2014 until \u2014\n\n\u201cWow, Harry \u2014 that must\u2019ve been fifty feet. . . .\u201d\n\nThe air was soon thick with flying gnomes.\n\n\u201cSee, they\u2019re not too bright,\u201d said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. \u201cThe moment they know the de-gnoming\u2019s going on they storm up to have a look. You\u2019d think they\u2019d have learned by now just to stay put.\u201d\n\nSoon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be back,\u201d said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. \u201cThey love it here. . . . Dad\u2019s too soft with them; he thinks they\u2019re funny. . . .\u201d\n\nJust then, the front door slammed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s back!\u201d said George. \u201cDad\u2019s home!\u201d\n\nThey hurried through the garden and back into the house.\n\nMr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children\u2019s. He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.\n\n\u201cWhat a night,\u201d he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him. \u201cNine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned. . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.\n\n\u201cFind anything, Dad?\u201d said Fred eagerly.\n\n\u201cAll I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\u201d yawned Mr. Weasley. \u201cThere was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn\u2019t my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that\u2019s the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cJust Muggle-baiting,\u201d sighed Mr. Weasley. \u201cSell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it. . . . Of course, it\u2019s very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking \u2014 they\u2019ll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they\u2019ll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it\u2019s staring them in the face. . . . But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn\u2019t believe \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley\u2019s eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.\n\n\u201cC-cars, Molly, dear?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Arthur, cars,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \u201cImagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly.\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley blinked.\n\n\u201cWell, dear, I think you\u2019ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if \u2014 er \u2014 he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth. . . . There\u2019s a loophole in the law, you\u2019ll find. . . . As long as he wasn\u2019t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!\u201d shouted Mrs. Weasley. \u201cJust so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren\u2019t intending to fly!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d said Mr. Weasley blankly. \u201cHarry who?\u201d\n\nHe looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.\n\n\u201cGood lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron\u2019s told us so much about \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour sons flew that car to Harry\u2019s house and back last night!\u201d shouted Mrs. Weasley. \u201cWhat have you got to say about that, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you really?\u201d said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \u201cDid it go all right? I \u2014 I mean,\u201d he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley\u2019s eyes, \u201cthat \u2014 that was very wrong, boys \u2014 very wrong indeed. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave them to it,\u201d Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you my bedroom.\u201d\n\nThey slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap.\n\n\u201cGinny,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how weird it is for her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally \u2014\u201d\n\nThey climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD\u2019S ROOM.\n\nHarry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron\u2019s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically.\n\n\u201cYour Quidditch team?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThe Chudley Cannons,\u201d said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C\u2019s and a speeding cannonball. \u201cNinth in the league.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron\u2019s magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun.\n\nHarry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys\u2019 hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for his opinion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit small,\u201d said Ron quickly. \u201cNot like that room you had with the Muggles. And I\u2019m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he\u2019s always banging on the pipes and groaning. . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry, grinning widely, said, \u201cThis is the best house I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears went pink."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter4": "AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS\n\n\n\n\nLife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys\u2019 house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted,\u201cTuck your shirt in, scruffy!\u201d The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George\u2019s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron\u2019s, however, wasn\u2019t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.\n\nMrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked.\n\n\u201cFascinating!\u201d he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. \u201cIngenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.\u201d\n\nHarry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn\u2019t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.\n\n\u201cLetters from school,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. \u201cDumbledore already knows you\u2019re here, Harry \u2014 doesn\u2019t miss a trick, that man. You two\u2019ve got them, too,\u201d he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas.\n\nFor a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harry\u2019s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King\u2019s Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books he\u2019d need for the coming year.\n\n\n\nSECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda Goshawk\n\nBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart\n\nGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart\n\nHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart\n\nTravels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart\n\nVoyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart\n\nWanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart\n\nYear with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart\n\n\n\nFred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry\u2019s.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been told to get all Lockhart\u2019s books, too!\u201d he said. \u201cThe new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan \u2014 bet it\u2019s a witch.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Fred caught his mother\u2019s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade.\n\n\u201cThat lot won\u2019t come cheap,\u201d said George, with a quick look at his parents. \u201cLockhart\u2019s books are really expensive. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll manage,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. \u201cI expect we\u2019ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny\u2019s things secondhand.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?\u201d Harry asked Ginny.\n\nShe nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron\u2019s elder brother Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest.\n\n\u201cMorning, all,\u201d said Percy briskly. \u201cLovely day.\u201d\n\nHe sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath him a molting, gray feather duster \u2014 at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was breathing.\n\n\u201cErrol!\u201d said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing. \u201cFinally \u2014 he\u2019s got Hermione\u2019s answer. I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.\u201d\n\nHe carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron laid him on the draining board instead, muttering, \u201cPathetic.\u201d Then he ripped open Hermione\u2019s letter and read it out loud:\n\n\u201c\u2018Dear Ron, and Harry if you\u2019re there,\n\n\u201c\u2018I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn\u2019t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too. I\u2019ve been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl, because I think another delivery might finish your one off.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m very busy with schoolwork, of course\u2019 \u2014 How can she be?\u201d said Ron in horror. \u201cWe\u2019re on vacation! \u2014 \u2018and we\u2019re going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don\u2019t we meet in Diagon Alley?\n\n\u201c\u2018Let me know what\u2019s happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. \u201cWhat\u2019re you all up to today?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn\u2019t fly too high. They couldn\u2019t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harry\u2019s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; Ron\u2019s old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.\n\nFive minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.\n\n\u201cWish I knew what he was up to,\u201d said Fred, frowning. \u201cHe\u2019s not himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrdinary Wizarding Levels,\u201d George explained, seeing Harry\u2019s puzzled look. \u201cBill got twelve, too. If we\u2019re not careful, we\u2019ll have another Head Boy in the family. I don\u2019t think I could stand the shame.\u201d\n\nBill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizards\u2019 bank, Gringotts.\n\n\u201cDunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,\u201d said George after a while. \u201cFive sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him. Of course, it was only in the Wizarding world that he had money; you couldn\u2019t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn\u2019t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold.\n\nMrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running low, Arthur,\u201d she sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to buy some more today. . . . Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!\u201d\n\nAnd she offered him the flowerpot.\n\nHarry stared at them all watching him.\n\n\u201cW-what am I supposed to do?\u201d he stammered.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never traveled by Floo powder,\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cSorry, Harry, I forgot.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever?\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cBut how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year?\u201d\n\n\u201cI went on the Underground \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \u201cWere there escapators? How exactly \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now, Arthur,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cFloo powder\u2019s a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you\u2019ve never used it before \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right, Mum,\u201d said Fred. \u201cHarry, watch us first.\u201d\n\nHe took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.\n\nWith a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, \u201cDiagon Alley!\u201d and vanished.\n\n\u201cYou must speak clearly, dear,\u201d Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot. \u201cAnd be sure to get out at the right grate. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right what?\u201d said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too.\n\n\u201cWell, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you\u2019ve spoken clearly \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, Molly, don\u2019t fuss,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to Floo powder, too.\n\n\u201cBut, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d Harry reassured her. \u201cDudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don\u2019t worry about that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . all right . . . you go after Arthur,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cNow, when you get into the fire, say where you\u2019re going \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd keep your elbows tucked in,\u201d Ron advised.\n\n\u201cAnd your eyes shut,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cThe soot \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fidget,\u201d said Ron. \u201cOr you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George.\u201d\n\nTrying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash.\n\n\u201cD-Dia-gon Alley,\u201d he coughed.\n\nIt felt as though he were being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed to be spinning very fast \u2014 the roaring in his ears was deafening \u2014 he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick \u2014 something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning \u2014 now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face \u2014 squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond \u2014 his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him \u2014 he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then \u2014\n\nHe fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap.\n\nDizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard\u2019s shop \u2014 but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.\n\nA glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.\n\nThe sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he\u2019d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass \u2014 and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.\n\nHarry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.\n\nThe man who followed could only be Draco\u2019s father. He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, \u201cTouch nothing, Draco.\u201d\n\nMalfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \u201cI thought you were going to buy me a present.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I would buy you a racing broom,\u201d said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of that if I\u2019m not on the House team?\u201d said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. \u201cHarry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He\u2019s not even that good, it\u2019s just because he\u2019s famous . . . famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead. . . .\u201d\n\nMalfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.\n\n\u201c. . . everyone thinks he\u2019s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have told me this at least a dozen times already,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \u201cAnd I would remind you that it is not \u2014 prudent \u2014 to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear \u2014 ah, Mr. Borgin.\u201d\n\nA stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face.\n\n\u201cMr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\u201d said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. \u201cDelighted \u2014 and young Master Malfoy, too \u2014 charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy.\n\n\u201cSelling?\u201d The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cYou have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \u201cI have a few \u2014 ah \u2014 items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call. . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry wouldn\u2019t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\u201d\n\nMr. Malfoy\u2019s lip curled.\n\n\u201cI have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act \u2014 no doubt that flea-bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry felt a hot surge of anger.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand, sir, of course,\u201d said Mr. Borgin. \u201cLet me see . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I have that?\u201d interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion.\n\n\u201cAh, the Hand of Glory!\u201d said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy\u2019s list and scurrying over to Draco. \u201cInsert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \u201cNo offense, sir, no offense meant \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThough if his grades don\u2019t pick up,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, \u201cthat may indeed be all he is fit for \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d retorted Draco. \u201cThe teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have thought you\u2019d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,\u201d snapped Mr. Malfoy.\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same all over,\u201d said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. \u201cWizard blood is counting for less everywhere \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot with me,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.\n\n\u201cNo, sir, nor with me, sir,\u201d said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.\n\n\u201cIn that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy shortly. \u201cI am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today \u2014\u201d\n\nThey started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman\u2019s rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed \u2014 Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.\n\nDraco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He walked forward \u2014 he stretched out his hand for the handle \u2014\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. \u201cCome, Draco \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.\n\n\u201cGood day to you, Mr. Borgin. I\u2019ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.\u201d\n\nThe moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.\n\n\u201cGood day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven\u2019t sold me half of what\u2019s hidden in your manor. . . .\u201d\n\nMuttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.\n\nClutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he\u2019d just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he\u2019d be able to find a way out of here.\n\nAn old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn\u2019t help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn\u2019t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys\u2019 fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do.\n\n\u201cNot lost are you, my dear?\u201d said a voice in his ear, making him jump.\n\nAn aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHARRY! What d\u2019yeh think yer doin\u2019 down there?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d Harry croaked in relief. \u201cI was lost \u2014 Floo powder \u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance \u2014 Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cYer a mess!\u201d said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary. \u201cSkulkin\u2019 around Knockturn Alley, I dunno \u2014 dodgy place, Harry \u2014 don\u2019 want no one ter see yeh down there \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI realized that,\u201d said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again. \u201cI told you, I was lost \u2014 what were you doing down there, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was lookin\u2019 fer a Flesh-Eatin\u2019 Slug Repellent,\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cThey\u2019re ruinin\u2019 the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go and find them. . . .\u201d\n\nThey set off together down the street.\n\n\u201cHow come yeh never wrote back ter me?\u201d said Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrid\u2019s enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys.\n\n\u201cLousy Muggles,\u201d growled Hagrid. \u201cIf I\u2019d\u2019ve known \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry! Over here!\u201d\n\nHarry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid \u2014 Oh, it\u2019s wonderful to see you two again \u2014 Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as I\u2019ve found the Weasleys,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeh won\u2019t have long ter wait,\u201d Hagrid said with a grin.\n\nHarry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Mr. Weasley panted. \u201cWe hoped you\u2019d only gone one grate too far. . . .\u201d He mopped his glistening bald patch. \u201cMolly\u2019s frantic \u2014 she\u2019s coming now \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you come out?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cKnockturn Alley,\u201d said Hagrid grimly.\n\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d said Fred and George together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been allowed in,\u201d said Ron enviously.\n\n\u201cI should ruddy well think not,\u201d growled Hagrid.\n\nMrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry \u2014 oh, my dear \u2014 you could have been anywhere \u2014\u201d\n\nGasping for breath, she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn\u2019t managed to beat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry\u2019s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and returned them, good as new.\n\n\u201cWell, gotta be off,\u201d said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (\u201cKnockturn Alley! If you hadn\u2019t found him, Hagrid!\u201d). \u201cSee yer at Hogwarts!\u201d And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.\n\n\u201cGuess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?\u201d Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. \u201cMalfoy and his father.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Lucius Malfoy buy anything?\u201d said Mr. Weasley sharply behind them.\n\n\u201cNo, he was selling \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s worried,\u201d said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. \u201cOh, I\u2019d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou be careful, Arthur,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. \u201cThat family\u2019s trouble. Don\u2019t go biting off more than you can chew \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t think I\u2019m a match for Lucius Malfoy?\u201d said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione\u2019s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re Muggles!\u201d said Mr. Weasley delightedly. \u201cWe must have a drink! What\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there? Oh, you\u2019re changing Muggle money. Molly, look!\u201d He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr. Granger\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cMeet you back here,\u201d Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.\n\nThe vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the bank\u2019s underground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys\u2019 vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag.\n\nBack outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. \u201cAnd not one step down Knockturn Alley!\u201d she shouted at the twins\u2019 retreating backs.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry\u2019s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster\u2019s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.\n\n\u201cA study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers,\u201d Ron read aloud off the back cover. \u201cThat sounds fascinating. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d Percy snapped.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course, he\u2019s very ambitious, Percy, he\u2019s got it all planned out. . . . He wants to be Minister of Magic . . .\u201d Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it.\n\nAn hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows:\n\n\n\nGILDEROY LOCKHART\n\nwill be signing copies of his autobiography\n\nMAGICAL ME\n\ntoday 12:30 P.M. to 4:30 P.M.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can actually meet him!\u201d Hermione squealed. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s written almost the whole booklist!\u201d\n\nThe crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs. Weasley\u2019s age. A harassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, \u201cCalmly, please, ladies. . . . Don\u2019t push, there . . . mind the books, now. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.\n\n\u201cOh, there you are, good,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to see him in a minute. . . .\u201d\n\nGilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard\u2019s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.\n\nA short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash.\n\n\u201cOut of the way, there,\u201d he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better shot. \u201cThis is for the Daily Prophet \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBig deal,\u201d said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it.\n\nGilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron \u2014 and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, \u201cIt can\u2019t be Harry Potter?\u201d\n\nThe crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry\u2019s arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry\u2019s face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys.\n\n\u201cNice big smile, Harry,\u201d said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth. \u201cTogether, you and I are worth the front page.\u201d\n\nWhen he finally let go of Harry\u2019s hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d he said loudly, waving for quiet. \u201cWhat an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I\u2019ve been sitting on for some time!\n\n\u201cWhen young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography \u2014 which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge \u2014\u201d The crowd applauded again. \u201cHe had no idea,\u201d Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, \u201cthat he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron.\n\n\u201cYou have these,\u201d Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron. \u201cI\u2019ll buy my own \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBet you loved that, didn\u2019t you, Potter?\u201d said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.\n\n\u201cFamous Harry Potter,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cCan\u2019t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave him alone, he didn\u2019t want all that!\u201d said Ginny. It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.\n\n\u201cPotter, you\u2019ve got yourself a girlfriend!\u201d drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart\u2019s books.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. \u201cBet you\u2019re surprised to see Harry here, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,\u201d retorted Malfoy. \u201cI suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.\u201d\n\nRon went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket.\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George. \u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s too crowded in here, let\u2019s go outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, well, well \u2014 Arthur Weasley.\u201d\n\nIt was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco\u2019s shoulder, sneering in just the same way.\n\n\u201cLucius,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.\n\n\u201cBusy time at the Ministry, I hear,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy. \u201cAll those raids . . . I hope they\u2019re paying you overtime?\u201d\n\nHe reached into Ginny\u2019s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Transfiguration.\n\n\u201cObviously not,\u201d Mr. Malfoy said. \u201cDear me, what\u2019s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don\u2019t even pay you well for it?\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.\n\n\u201cWe have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cClearly,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. \u201cThe company you keep, Weasley . . . and I thought your family could sink no lower \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a thud of metal as Ginny\u2019s cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, \u201cGet him, Dad!\u201d from Fred or George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, \u201cNo, Arthur, no!\u201d; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; \u201cGentlemen, please \u2014 please!\u201d cried the assistant, and then, louder than all \u2014\n\n\u201cBreak it up, there, gents, break it up \u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still holding Ginny\u2019s old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice.\n\n\u201cHere, girl \u2014 take your book \u2014 it\u2019s the best your father can give you \u2014\u201d Pulling himself out of Hagrid\u2019s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.\n\n\u201cYeh should\u2019ve ignored him, Arthur,\u201d said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. \u201cRotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that \u2014 no Malfoy\u2019s worth listenin\u2019 ter \u2014 bad blood, that\u2019s what it is \u2014 come on now \u2014 let\u2019s get outta here.\u201d\n\nThe assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid\u2019s waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury.\n\n\u201cA fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in public . . . what Gilderoy Lockhart must\u2019ve thought \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was pleased,\u201d said Fred. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear him as we were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he\u2019d be able to work the fight into his report \u2014 said it was all publicity \u2014\u201d\n\nBut it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley\u2019s face.\n\nHarry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn\u2019t his favorite way to travel."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter5": "THE WHOMPING WILLOW\n\n\n\n\nThe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry\u2019s liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.\n\nOn their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry\u2019s favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed.\n\nIt took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny\u2019s trunk to the car.\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.\n\n\u201cNot a word to Molly,\u201d he whispered to Harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily.\n\nWhen at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, \u201cMuggles do know more than we give them credit for, don\u2019t they?\u201d She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. \u201cI mean, you\u2019d never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to wonder when he\u2019d see it again when they were back \u2014 George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she\u2019d left her diary. By the time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high.\n\nMr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.\n\n\u201cMolly, dear \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Arthur \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one would see \u2014 this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed \u2014 that\u2019d get us up in the air \u2014 then we fly above the clouds. We\u2019d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight \u2014\u201d\n\nThey reached King\u2019s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station.\n\nHarry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn\u2019t visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn\u2019t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.\n\n\u201cPercy first,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier.\n\nPercy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George followed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\u201d Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny\u2019s hand and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go together, we\u2019ve only got a minute,\u201d Ron said to Harry.\n\nHarry made sure that Hedwig\u2019s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt perfectly confident; this wasn\u2019t nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and \u2014\n\nCRASH.\n\nBoth trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron\u2019s trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig\u2019s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, \u201cWhat in blazes d\u2019you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cLost control of the trolley,\u201d Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we get through?\u201d Harry hissed to Ron.\n\n\u201cI dunno \u2014\u201d\n\nRon looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still watching them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to miss the train,\u201d Ron whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the gateway\u2019s sealed itself \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. Ten seconds . . . nine seconds . . .\n\nHe wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.\n\nThree seconds . . . two seconds . . . one second . . .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d said Ron, sounding stunned. \u201cThe train\u2019s left. What if Mum and Dad can\u2019t get back through to us? Have you got any Muggle money?\u201d\n\nHarry gave a hollow laugh. \u201cThe Dursleys haven\u2019t given me pocket money for about six years.\u201d\n\nRon pressed his ear to the cold barrier.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t hear a thing,\u201d he said tensely. \u201cWhat\u2019re we going to do? I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us.\u201d\n\nThey looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of Hedwig\u2019s continuing screeches.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019d better go and wait by the car,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe\u2019re attracting too much atten \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d said Ron, his eyes gleaming. \u201cThe car!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can fly the car to Hogwarts!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I thought \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stuck, right? And we\u2019ve got to get to school, haven\u2019t we? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it\u2019s a real emergency, section nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your mum and dad . . .\u201d said Harry, pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way. \u201cHow will they get home?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need the car!\u201d said Ron impatiently. \u201cThey know how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother with Floo powder and the car because we\u2019re all underage and we\u2019re not allowed to Apparate yet. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.\n\n\u201cCan you fly it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to face the exit. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go. If we hurry we\u2019ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.\n\nRon unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand. They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front.\n\n\u201cCheck that no one\u2019s watching,\u201d said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said.\n\nRon pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them vanished \u2014 and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice from his right.\n\nAnd the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them.\n\nThen there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron reappeared.\n\n\u201cUh-oh,\u201d said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \u201cIt\u2019s faulty \u2014\u201d\n\nBoth of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back again.\n\n\u201cHold on!\u201d Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the accelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy.\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides.\n\n\u201cWe need to see the train to know what direction to go in,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cDip back down again \u2014 quickly \u2014\u201d\n\nThey dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats, squinting at the ground.\n\n\u201cI can see it!\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cRight ahead \u2014 there!\u201d\n\nThe Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake.\n\n\u201cDue north,\u201d said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll just have to check on it every half hour or so \u2014 hold on \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out into a blaze of sunlight.\n\nIt was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019ve got to worry about now are airplanes,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThey looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they couldn\u2019t stop.\n\nIt was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel \u2014 past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred\u2019s and George\u2019s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle.\n\nThey made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.\n\nSeveral uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry\u2019s T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why hadn\u2019t they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t be much further, can it?\u201d croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. \u201cReady for another check on the train?\u201d\n\nIt was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds.\n\nRon put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but as he did so, the engine began to whine.\n\nHarry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably just tired,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s never been this far before. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were blossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest.\n\n\u201cNot far,\u201d said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, \u201cnot far now,\u201d and he patted the dashboard nervously.\n\nWhen they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump. \u201cStraight ahead!\u201d\n\nSilhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.\n\nBut the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a little shake, \u201cnearly there, come on \u2014\u201d\n\nThe engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake.\n\nThe car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below. Ron\u2019s knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled again.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\nThey were over the lake \u2014 the castle was right ahead \u2014 Ron put his foot down.\n\nThere was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely.\n\n\u201cUh-oh,\u201d said Ron, into the silence.\n\nThe nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall.\n\n\u201cNoooooo!\u201d Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.\n\nRon let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket \u2014\n\n\u201cSTOP! STOP!\u201d he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them \u2014\n\n\u201cWATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!\u201d Harry bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late \u2014\n\nCRUNCH.\n\nWith an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golf-ball-sized lump was throbbing on Harry\u2019s head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Harry said urgently.\n\n\u201cMy wand,\u201d said Ron, in a shaky voice. \u201cLook at my wand \u2014\u201d\n\nIt had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters.\n\nHarry opened his mouth to say he was sure they\u2019d be able to mend it up at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happen \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nRon gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree they had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach.\n\n\u201cAaargh!\u201d said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving \u2014\n\n\u201cRun for it!\u201d Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry\u2019s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re done for!\u201d he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating \u2014 the engine had restarted.\n\n\u201cReverse!\u201d Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d panted Ron, \u201cwas close. Well done, car \u2014\u201d\n\nThe car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig\u2019s cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.\n\n\u201cCome back!\u201d Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand. \u201cDad\u2019ll kill me!\u201d\n\nBut the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust.\n\n\u201cCan you believe our luck?\u201d said Ron miserably, bending down to pick up Scabbers. \u201cOf all the trees we could\u2019ve hit, we had to get one that hits back.\u201d\n\nHe glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing its branches threateningly.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Harry wearily, \u201cwe\u2019d better get up to the school. . . .\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.\n\n\u201cI think the feast\u2019s already started,\u201d said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window. \u201cHey \u2014 Harry \u2014 come and look \u2014 it\u2019s the Sorting!\u201d\n\nHarry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall.\n\nInnumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with stars.\n\nThrough the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny was among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.\n\nEvery year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the House that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other \u2014 but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years.\n\nA very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head. Harry\u2019s eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.\n\n\u201cHang on . . .\u201d Harry muttered to Ron. \u201cThere\u2019s an empty chair at the staff table. . . . Where\u2019s Snape?\u201d\n\nProfessor Severus Snape was Harry\u2019s least favorite teacher. Harry also happened to be Snape\u2019s least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from his own House (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s ill!\u201d said Ron hopefully.\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s left,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbecause he missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again!\u201d\n\n\u201cOr he might have been sacked!\u201d said Ron enthusiastically. \u201cI mean, everyone hates him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOr maybe,\u201d said a very cold voice right behind them, \u201che\u2019s waiting to hear why you two didn\u2019t arrive on the school train.\u201d\n\nHarry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble.\n\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d said Snape.\n\nNot daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.\n\n\u201cIn!\u201d he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing.\n\nThey entered Snape\u2019s office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn\u2019t really want to know the name of at the moment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the door and turned to look at them.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said softly, \u201cthe train isn\u2019t good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, it was the barrier at King\u2019s Cross, it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence!\u201d said Snape coldly. \u201cWhat have you done with the car?\u201d\n\nRon gulped. This wasn\u2019t the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he understood, as Snape unrolled today\u2019s issue of the Evening Prophet.\n\n\u201cYou were seen,\u201d he hissed, showing them the headline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read aloud: \u201cTwo Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower . . . at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing . . . Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police . . . Six or seven Muggles in all. I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?\u201d he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. \u201cDear, dear . . . his own son . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though he\u2019d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree\u2019s larger branches. If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car . . . he hadn\u2019t thought of that. . . .\n\n\u201cI noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,\u201d Snape went on.\n\n\u201cThat tree did more damage to us than we \u2014\u201d Ron blurted out.\n\n\u201cSilence!\u201d snapped Snape again. \u201cMost unfortunately, you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. You will wait here.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn\u2019t feel hungry anymore. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape\u2019s desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better off. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict.\n\nTen minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted.\n\n\u201cSit,\u201d she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.\n\n\u201cExplain,\u201d she said, her glasses glinting ominously.\n\nRon launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through.\n\n\u201c\u2014 so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn\u2019t get on the train.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?\u201d Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.\n\nHarry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I didn\u2019t think \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, \u201cis obvious.\u201d\n\nThere was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier than ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore.\n\nHarry\u2019s whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually grave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow.\n\nThere was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, \u201cPlease explain why you did this.\u201d\n\nIt would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the disappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go and get our stuff,\u201d said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Weasley?\u201d barked Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re expelling us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHarry looked quickly at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cNot today, Mr. Weasley,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to both your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.\u201d\n\nSnape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his throat and said, \u201cProfessor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree \u2014 surely acts of this nature \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys\u2019 punishments, Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cThey are in her House and are therefore her responsibility.\u201d He turned to Professor McGonagall. \u201cI must go back to the feast, Minerva, I\u2019ve got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there\u2019s a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much,\u201d said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve. \u201cProfessor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sorting Ceremony is over,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cYour sister is also in Gryffindor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cAnd speaking of Gryffindor \u2014\u201d Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: \u201cProfessor, when we took the car, term hadn\u2019t started, so \u2014 so Gryffindor shouldn\u2019t really have points taken from it \u2014 should it?\u201d he finished, watching her anxiously.\n\nProfessor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure she had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.\n\n\u201cI will not take any points from Gryffindor,\u201d she said, and Harry\u2019s heart lightened considerably. \u201cBut you will both get a detention.\u201d\n\nIt was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore\u2019s writing to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly well they\u2019d just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn\u2019t squashed him flat.\n\nProfessor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape\u2019s desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop.\n\n\u201cYou will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,\u201d she said. \u201cI must also return to the feast.\u201d\n\nWhen the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.\n\n\u201cI thought we\u2019d had it,\u201d he said, grabbing a sandwich.\n\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d said Harry, taking one, too.\n\n\u201cCan you believe our luck, though?\u201d said Ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham. \u201cFred and George must\u2019ve flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them.\u201d He swallowed and took another huge bite. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we get through the barrier?\u201d\n\nHarry shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to watch our step from now on, though,\u201d he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. \u201cWish we could\u2019ve gone up to the feast. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t want us showing off,\u201d said Ron sagely. \u201cDoesn\u2019t want people to think it\u2019s clever, arriving by flying car.\u201d\n\nWhen they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate kept refilling itself), they rose and left the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n\n\u201cPassword?\u201d she said as they approached.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014\u201d said Harry.\n\nThey didn\u2019t know the new year\u2019s password, not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward them.\n\n\u201cThere you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors \u2014 someone said you\u2019d been expelled for crashing a flying car \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t been expelled,\u201d Harry assured her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me you did fly here?\u201d said Hermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cSkip the lecture,\u201d said Ron impatiently, \u201cand tell us the new password.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018wattlebird,\u2019\u201d said Hermione impatiently, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the point \u2014\u201d\n\nHer words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after them.\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d yelled Lee Jordan. \u201cInspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people\u2019ll be talking about that one for years \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGood for you,\u201d said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he\u2019d just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we\u2019ve come in the car, eh?\u201d Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn\u2019t look happy at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy\u2019s direction. Ron got the point at once.\n\n\u201cGot to get upstairs \u2014 bit tired,\u201d he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.\n\n\u201c\u2019Night,\u201d Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy\u2019s.\n\nThey managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.\n\nRon grinned guiltily at Harry.\n\n\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve enjoyed that or anything, but \u2014\u201d\n\nThe dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable!\u201d beamed Seamus.\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d said Dean.\n\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d said Neville, awestruck.\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t help it. He grinned, too."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter6": "GILDEROY LOCKHART\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long House tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said \u201cMorning,\u201d which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.\n\n\u201cMail\u2019s due any minute \u2014 I think Gran\u2019s sending a few things I forgot.\u201d\n\nHarry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville\u2019s head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione\u2019s jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers.\n\n\u201cErrol!\u201d said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak.\n\n\u201cOh, no \u2014\u201d Ron gasped.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, he\u2019s still alive,\u201d said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that \u2014 it\u2019s that.\u201d\n\nRon was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s sent me a Howler,\u201d said Ron faintly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better open it, Ron,\u201d said Neville in a timid whisper. \u201cIt\u2019ll be worse if you don\u2019t. My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\u201d \u2014 he gulped \u2014 \u201cit was horrible.\u201d\n\nHarry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Howler?\u201d he said.\n\nBut Ron\u2019s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners.\n\n\u201cOpen it,\u201d Neville urged. \u201cIt\u2019ll all be over in a few minutes \u2014\u201d\n\nRon stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol\u2019s beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.\n\n\u201c\u2014 STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN\u2019T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY\u2019D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON\u2019T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE \u2014\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley\u2019s yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen.\n\n\u201c\u2014 LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN\u2019T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn\u2019t hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb.\n\n\u201c\u2014 ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED \u2014 YOUR FATHER\u2019S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT\u2019S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE\u2019LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.\u201d\n\nA ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron\u2019s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.\n\nHermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what you expected, Ron, but you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I deserved it,\u201d snapped Ron.\n\nHarry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer . . .\n\nBut he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again.\n\nAs they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout\u2019s arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings.\n\nProfessor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming.\n\n\u201cOh, hello there!\u201d he called, beaming around at the assembled students. \u201cJust been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! But I don\u2019t want you running away with the idea that I\u2019m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGreenhouse three today, chaps!\u201d said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.\n\nThere was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before \u2014 greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart\u2019s hand shot out.\n\n\u201cHarry! I\u2019ve been wanting a word \u2014 you don\u2019t mind if he\u2019s a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\u201d\n\nJudging by Professor Sprout\u2019s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, \u201cThat\u2019s the ticket,\u201d and closed the greenhouse door in her face.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head. \u201cHarry, Harry, Harry.\u201d\n\nCompletely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard \u2014 well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked myself.\u201d\n\nHarry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so when Lockhart went on, \u201cDon\u2019t know when I\u2019ve been more shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you\u2019d done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\u201d\n\nIt was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn\u2019t talking.\n\n\u201cGave you a taste for publicity, didn\u2019t I?\u201d said Lockhart. \u201cGave you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn\u2019t wait to do it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, Professor, see \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, Harry, Harry,\u201d said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder. \u201cI understand. Natural to want a bit more once you\u2019ve had that first taste \u2014 and I blame myself for giving you that, because it was bound to go to your head \u2014 but see here, young man, you can\u2019t start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you\u2019re older. Yes, yes, I know what you\u2019re thinking! \u2018It\u2019s all right for him, he\u2019s an internationally famous wizard already!\u2019 But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, I\u2019d say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven\u2019t they? All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\u201d He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead. \u201cI know, I know \u2014 it\u2019s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly\u2019s Most-Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have \u2014 but it\u2019s a start, Harry, it\u2019s a start.\u201d\n\nHe gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside.\n\nProfessor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored earmuffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?\u201d\n\nTo nobody\u2019s surprise, Hermione\u2019s hand was first into the air.\n\n\u201cMandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\u201d said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \u201cIt is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\u201d said Professor Sprout. \u201cThe Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s hand narrowly missed Harry\u2019s glasses as it shot up again.\n\n\u201cThe cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\u201d she said promptly.\n\n\u201cPrecisely. Take another ten points,\u201d said Professor Sprout. \u201cNow, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn\u2019t have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the \u201ccry\u201d of the Mandrake.\n\n\u201cEveryone take a pair of earmuffs,\u201d said Professor Sprout.\n\nThere was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn\u2019t pink and fluffy.\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,\u201d said Professor Sprout. \u201cWhen it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right \u2014 earmuffs on.\u201d\n\nHarry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.\n\nHarry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.\n\nInstead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.\n\nProfessor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.\n\n\u201cAs our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won\u2019t kill yet,\u201d she said calmly as though she\u2019d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. \u201cHowever, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I\u2019m sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up.\n\n\u201cFour to a tray \u2014 there is a large supply of pots here \u2014 compost in the sacks over there \u2014 and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it\u2019s teething.\u201d\n\nShe gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.\n\n\u201cJustin Finch-Fletchley,\u201d he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand. \u201cKnow who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter. . . . And you\u2019re Hermione Granger \u2014 always top in everything\u201d (Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) \u201c\u2014 and Ron Weasley. Wasn\u2019t that your flying car?\u201d\n\nRon didn\u2019t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.\n\n\u201cThat Lockhart\u2019s something, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \u201cAwfully brave chap. Have you read his books? I\u2019d have died of fear if I\u2019d been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and \u2014 zap \u2014 just fantastic.\n\n\u201cMy name was down for Eton, you know. I can\u2019t tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart\u2019s books I think she\u2019s begun to see how useful it\u2019ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family. . . .\u201d\n\nAfter that they didn\u2019t have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn\u2019t. The Mandrakes didn\u2019t like coming out of the earth, but didn\u2019t seem to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.\n\nBy the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.\n\nRon was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn\u2019t pleased.\n\nHarry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.\n\n\u201cStupid \u2014 useless \u2014 thing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWrite home for another one,\u201d Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\u201d said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s your own fault your wand got snapped \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\nThey went down to lunch, where Ron\u2019s mood was not improved by Hermione\u2019s showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve we got this afternoon?\u201d said Harry, hastily changing the subject.\n\n\u201cDefense Against the Dark Arts,\u201d said Hermione at once.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \u201chave you outlined all Lockhart\u2019s lessons in little hearts?\u201d\n\nHermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.\n\nThey finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he\u2019d seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red.\n\n\u201cAll right, Harry? I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m Colin Creevey,\u201d he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. \u201cI\u2019m in Gryffindor, too. D\u2019you think \u2014 would it be all right if \u2014 can I have a picture?\u201d he said, raising the camera hopefully.\n\n\u201cA picture?\u201d Harry repeated blankly.\n\n\u201cSo I can prove I\u2019ve met you,\u201d said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward. \u201cI know all about you. Everyone\u2019s told me. About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you\u2019ve still got a lightning scar on your forehead\u201d (his eyes raked Harry\u2019s hairline) \u201cand a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures\u2019ll move.\u201d Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing here, isn\u2019t it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad\u2019s a milkman, he couldn\u2019t believe it either. So I\u2019m taking loads of pictures to send home to him. And it\u2019d be really good if I had one of you\u201d \u2014 he looked imploringly at Harry \u2014 \u201cmaybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSigned photos? You\u2019re giving out signed photos, Potter?\u201d\n\nLoud and scathing, Draco Malfoy\u2019s voice echoed around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cEveryone line up!\u201d Malfoy roared to the crowd. \u201cHarry Potter\u2019s giving out signed photos!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \u201cShut up, Malfoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous,\u201d piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cJealous?\u201d said Malfoy, who didn\u2019t need to shout anymore: Half the courtyard was listening in. \u201cOf what? I don\u2019t want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don\u2019t think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.\u201d\n\nCrabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.\n\n\u201cEat slugs, Malfoy,\u201d said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.\n\n\u201cBe careful, Weasley,\u201d sneered Malfoy. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to start any trouble or your mummy\u2019ll have to come and take you away from school.\u201d He put on a shrill, piercing voice. \u201c\u2018If you put another toe out of line\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\nA knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed loudly at this.\n\n\u201cWeasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\u201d smirked Malfoy. \u201cIt\u2019d be worth more than his family\u2019s whole house \u2014\u201d\n\nRon whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, \u201cLook out!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this, what\u2019s all this?\u201d Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. \u201cWho\u2019s giving out signed photos?\u201d\n\nHarry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, \u201cShouldn\u2019t have asked! We meet again, Harry!\u201d\n\nPinned to Lockhart\u2019s side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd.\n\n\u201cCome on then, Mr. Creevey,\u201d said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. \u201cA double portrait, can\u2019t do better than that, and we\u2019ll both sign it for you.\u201d\n\nColin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.\n\n\u201cOff you go, move along there,\u201d Lockhart called to the crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.\n\n\u201cA word to the wise, Harry,\u201d said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door. \u201cI covered up for you back there with young Creevey \u2014 if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won\u2019t think you\u2019re setting yourself up so much. . . .\u201d\n\nDeaf to Harry\u2019s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase.\n\n\u201cLet me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn\u2019t sensible \u2014 looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you\u2019ll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but\u201d \u2014 he gave a little chortle \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite there yet.\u201d\n\nThey had reached Lockhart\u2019s classroom and he let Harry go at last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart\u2019s books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing.\n\nThe rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry.\n\n\u201cYou could\u2019ve fried an egg on your face,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope Creevey doesn\u2019t meet Ginny, or they\u2019ll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase \u201cHarry Potter fan club.\u201d\n\nWhen the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom\u2019s copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \u201cGilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly\u2019s Most-Charming-Smile Award \u2014 but I don\u2019t talk about that. I didn\u2019t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!\u201d\n\nHe waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.\n\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve all bought a complete set of my books \u2014 well done. I thought we\u2019d start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about \u2014 just to check how well you\u2019ve read them, how much you\u2019ve taken in \u2014\u201d\n\nWhen he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, \u201cYou have thirty minutes \u2014 start \u2014 now!\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at his paper and read:\n\n\n\n1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s favorite color?\n\n2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s secret ambition?\n\n3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s greatest achievement to date?\n\n\n\n\n\nOn and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:\n\n\n\n54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s birthday, and what would his ideal gift be?\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class.\n\n\u201cTut, tut \u2014 hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully \u2014 I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples \u2014 though I wouldn\u2019t say no to a large bottle of Ogden\u2019s Old Firewhisky!\u201d\n\nHe gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name.\n\n\u201c. . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions \u2014 good girl! In fact\u201d \u2014 he flipped her paper over \u2014 \u201cfull marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?\u201d\n\nHermione raised a trembling hand.\n\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d beamed Lockhart. \u201cQuite excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so \u2014 to business \u2014\u201d\n\nHe bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.\n\n\u201cNow \u2014 be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\u201d\n\nIn spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat.\n\n\u201cI must ask you not to scream,\u201d said Lockhart in a low voice. \u201cIt might provoke them.\u201d\n\nAs the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said dramatically. \u201cFreshly caught Cornish pixies.\u201d\n\nSeamus Finnigan couldn\u2019t control himself. He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn\u2019t mistake for a scream of terror.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d He smiled at Seamus.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not very \u2014 dangerous, are they?\u201d Seamus choked.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure!\u201d said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. \u201cDevilish tricky little blighters they can be!\u201d\n\nThe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them.\n\n\u201cRight, then,\u201d Lockhart said loudly. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you make of them!\u201d And he opened the cage.\n\nIt was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, upended the wastebasket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling.\n\n\u201cCome on now \u2014 round them up, round them up, they\u2019re only pixies,\u201d Lockhart shouted.\n\nHe rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, \u201cPeskipiksi Pesternomi!\u201d\n\nIt had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way.\n\nThe bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\u201d He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.\n\n\u201cCan you believe him?\u201d roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.\n\n\u201cHe just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\u201d said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage.\n\n\u201cHands on?\u201d said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. \u201cHermione, he didn\u2019t have a clue what he was doing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cYou\u2019ve read his books \u2014 look at all those amazing things he\u2019s done \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says he\u2019s done,\u201d Ron muttered."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter7": "MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS\n\n\n\n\nHarry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry\u2019s schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \u201cAll right, Harry?\u201d six or seven times a day and hear, \u201cHello, Colin,\u201d back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.\n\nHedwig was still angry with Harry about the disastrous car journey and Ron\u2019s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron\u2019s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\n\n\u201cWhassamatter?\u201d said Harry groggily.\n\n\u201cQuidditch practice!\u201d said Wood. \u201cCome on!\u201d\n\nHarry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn\u2019t understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making.\n\n\u201cOliver,\u201d Harry croaked. \u201cIt\u2019s the crack of dawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let\u2019s go,\u201d said Wood heartily. \u201cNone of the other teams have started training yet; we\u2019re going to be first off the mark this year \u2014\u201d\n\nYawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.\n\n\u201cGood man,\u201d said Wood. \u201cMeet you on the field in fifteen minutes.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he\u2019d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand.\n\n\u201cI heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I\u2019ve got here! I\u2019ve had it developed, I wanted to show you \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose.\n\nA moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture.\n\n\u201cWill you sign it?\u201d said Colin eagerly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. \u201cSorry, Colin, I\u2019m in a hurry \u2014 Quidditch practice \u2014\u201d\n\nHe climbed through the portrait hole.\n\n\u201cOh, wow! Wait for me! I\u2019ve never watched a Quidditch game before!\u201d\n\nColin scrambled through the hole after him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be really boring,\u201d Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement.\n\n\u201cYou were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren\u2019t you, Harry? Weren\u2019t you?\u201d said Colin, trotting alongside him. \u201cYou must be brilliant. I\u2019ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an extremely talkative shadow.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really understand Quidditch,\u201d said Colin breathlessly. \u201cIs it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. \u201cThey\u2019re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are the other balls for?\u201d Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, the Quaffle \u2014 that\u2019s the biggish red one \u2014 is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goalposts at the end of the pitch \u2014 they\u2019re three long poles with hoops on the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the fourth ball \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 is the Golden Snitch,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand it\u2019s very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that\u2019s what the Seeker\u2019s got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn\u2019t end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team\u2019s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Colin in awe.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the Keeper, too. He guards the goalposts. That\u2019s it, really.\u201d\n\nBut Colin didn\u2019t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, \u201cI\u2019ll go and get a good seat, Harry!\u201d and hurried off to the stands.\n\nThe rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them.\n\n\u201cThere you are, Harry, what kept you?\u201d said Wood briskly. \u201cNow, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference. . . .\u201d\n\nWood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different-colored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley\u2019s head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet\u2019s shoulder and he began to snore.\n\nThe first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. \u201cIs that clear? Any questions?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a question, Oliver,\u201d said George, who had woken with a start. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?\u201d\n\nWood wasn\u2019t pleased.\n\n\u201cNow, listen here, you lot,\u201d he said, glowering at them all. \u201cWe should have won the Quidditch Cup last year. We\u2019re easily the best team. But unfortunately \u2014 owing to circumstances beyond our control \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.\n\nWood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.\n\n\u201cSo this year, we train harder than ever before. . . . Okay, let\u2019s go and put our new theories into practice!\u201d Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed.\n\nThey had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you finished yet?\u201d called Ron incredulously.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t even started,\u201d said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. \u201cWood\u2019s been teaching us new moves.\u201d\n\nHe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood\u2019s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that funny clicking noise?\u201d called Fred as they hurtled around the corner.\n\nHarry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.\n\n\u201cLook this way, Harry! This way!\u201d he cried shrilly.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. \u201cWhy\u2019s that first year taking pictures? I don\u2019t like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in Gryffindor,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cAnd the Slytherins don\u2019t need a spy, Oliver,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d said Wood testily.\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re here in person,\u201d said George, pointing.\n\nSeveral people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Wood hissed in outrage. \u201cI booked the field for today! We\u2019ll see about this!\u201d\n\nWood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed.\n\n\u201cFlint!\u201d Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \u201cThis is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\u201d\n\nMarcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, \u201cPlenty of room for all of us, Wood.\u201d\n\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.\n\n\u201cBut I booked the field!\u201d said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \u201cI booked it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Flint. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. \u2018I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a new Seeker?\u201d said Wood, distracted. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\nAnd from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you Lucius Malfoy\u2019s son?\u201d said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike.\n\n\u201cFunny you should mention Draco\u2019s father,\u201d said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. \u201cLet me show you the generous gift he\u2019s made to the Slytherin team.\u201d\n\nAll seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors\u2019 noses in the early morning sun.\n\n\u201cVery latest model. Only came out last month,\u201d said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \u201cI believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps\u201d \u2014 he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives \u2014 \u201csweeps the board with them.\u201d\n\nNone of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.\n\n\u201cOh, look,\u201d said Flint. \u201cA field invasion.\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Ron asked Harry. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you playing? And what\u2019s he doing here?\u201d\n\nHe was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\u201d said Malfoy, smugly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s just been admiring the brooms my father\u2019s bought our team.\u201d\n\nRon gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.\n\n\u201cGood, aren\u2019t they?\u201d said Malfoy smoothly. \u201cBut perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.\u201d\n\nThe Slytherin team howled with laughter.\n\n\u201cAt least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\u201d said Hermione sharply. \u201cThey got in on pure talent.\u201d\n\nThe smug look on Malfoy\u2019s face flickered.\n\n\u201cNo one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,\u201d he spat.\n\nHarry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, \u201cHow dare you!\u201d, and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that one, Malfoy!\u201d and pointed it furiously under Flint\u2019s arm at Malfoy\u2019s face.\n\nA loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron\u2019s wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass.\n\n\u201cRon! Ron! Are you all right?\u201d squealed Hermione.\n\nRon opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.\n\nThe Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better get him to Hagrid\u2019s, it\u2019s nearest,\u201d said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms.\n\n\u201cWhat happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can\u2019t you?\u201d Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front.\n\n\u201cOooh,\u201d said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. \u201cCan you hold him still, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of the way, Colin!\u201d said Harry angrily. He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.\n\n\u201cNearly there, Ron,\u201d said Hermione as the gamekeeper\u2019s cabin came into view. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right in a minute \u2014 almost there \u2014\u201d\n\nThey were within twenty feet of Hagrid\u2019s house when the front door opened, but it wasn\u2019t Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.\n\n\u201cQuick, behind here,\u201d Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple matter if you know what you\u2019re doing!\u201d Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. \u201cIf you need help, you know where I am! I\u2019ll let you have a copy of my book. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t already got one \u2014 I\u2019ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!\u201d And he strode away toward the castle.\n\nHarry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid\u2019s front door. They knocked urgently.\n\nHagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was.\n\n\u201cBin wonderin\u2019 when you\u2019d come ter see me \u2014 come in, come in \u2014 thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn\u2019t seem perturbed by Ron\u2019s slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair.\n\n\u201cBetter out than in,\u201d he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him. \u201cGet \u2019em all up, Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to do except wait for it to stop,\u201d said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand \u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?\u201d Harry asked, scratching Fang\u2019s ears.\n\n\u201cGivin\u2019 me advice on gettin\u2019 kelpies out of a well,\u201d growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. \u201cLike I don\u2019 know. An\u2019 bangin\u2019 on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I\u2019ll eat my kettle.\u201d\n\nIt was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, \u201cI think you\u2019re being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the on\u2019y man for the job,\u201d said Hagrid, offering them a plate of treacle toffee, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin. \u201cAn\u2019 I mean the on\u2019y one. Gettin\u2019 very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job. People aren\u2019t too keen ter take it on, see. They\u2019re startin\u2019 ter think it\u2019s jinxed. No one\u2019s lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,\u201d said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. \u201cWho was he tryin\u2019 ter curse?\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy called Hermione something \u2014 it must\u2019ve been really bad, because everyone went wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was bad,\u201d said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. \u201cMalfoy called her \u2018Mudblood,\u2019 Hagrid \u2014\u201d\n\nRon dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019!\u201d he growled at Hermione.\n\n\u201cHe did,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the most insulting thing he could think of,\u201d gasped Ron, coming back up. \u201cMudblood\u2019s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born \u2014 you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards \u2014 like Malfoy\u2019s family \u2014 who think they\u2019re better than everyone else because they\u2019re what people call pure-blood.\u201d He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and continued, \u201cI mean, the rest of us know it doesn\u2019t make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom \u2014 he\u2019s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 they haven\u2019t invented a spell our Hermione can\u2019 do,\u201d said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disgusting thing to call someone,\u201d said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. \u201cDirty blood, see. Common blood. It\u2019s ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn\u2019t married Muggles we\u2019d\u2019ve died out.\u201d\n\nHe retched and ducked out of sight again.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019 blame yeh fer tryin\u2019 ter curse him, Ron,\u201d said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. \u201cBu\u2019 maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. \u2019Spect Lucius Malfoy would\u2019ve come marchin\u2019 up ter school if yeh\u2019d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.\u201d\n\nHarry would have pointed out that trouble didn\u2019t come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn\u2019t; Hagrid\u2019s treacle toffee had cemented his jaws together.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. \u201cGotta bone ter pick with yeh. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ve bin givin\u2019 out signed photos. How come I haven\u2019t got one?\u201d\n\nFurious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.\n\n\u201cI have not been giving out signed photos,\u201d he said hotly. \u201cIf Lockhart\u2019s still spreading that around \u2014\u201d\n\nBut then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on\u2019y jokin\u2019,\u201d he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table. \u201cI knew yeh hadn\u2019t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn\u2019 need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet he didn\u2019t like that,\u201d said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 think he did,\u201d said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. \u201cAn\u2019 then I told him I\u2019d never read one o\u2019 his books an\u2019 he decided ter go. Treacle toffee, Ron?\u201d he added as Ron reappeared.\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d said Ron weakly. \u201cBetter not risk it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome an\u2019 see what I\u2019ve bin growin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea.\n\nIn the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid\u2019s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder.\n\n\u201cGettin\u2019 on well, aren\u2019t they?\u201d said Hagrid happily. \u201cFer the Halloween feast . . . should be big enough by then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you been feeding them?\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve bin givin\u2019 them \u2014 you know \u2014 a bit o\u2019 help \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry noticed Hagrid\u2019s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid\u2019s old school wand was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn\u2019t supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why \u2014 any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed.\n\n\u201cAn Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\u201d said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve done a good job on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what yer little sister said,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. \u201cMet her jus\u2019 yesterday.\u201d Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. \u201cSaid she was jus\u2019 lookin\u2019 round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin\u2019 she might run inter someone else at my house.\u201d He winked at Harry. \u201cIf yeh ask me, she wouldn\u2019 say no ter a signed \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs.\n\n\u201cWatch it!\u201d Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins.\n\nIt was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle toffee since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.\n\nThey had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, \u201cThere you are, Potter \u2014 Weasley.\u201d Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern. \u201cYou will both do your detentions this evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we doing, Professor?\u201d said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp.\n\n\u201cYou will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cAnd no magic, Weasley \u2014 elbow grease.\u201d\n\nRon gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school.\n\n\u201cAnd you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cOh n \u2014 Professor, can\u2019t I go and do the trophy room, too?\u201d said Harry desperately.\n\n\u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. \u201cProfessor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o\u2019clock sharp, both of you.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression. Harry didn\u2019t enjoy his shepherd\u2019s pie as much as he\u2019d thought. Both he and Ron felt they\u2019d got the worse deal.\n\n\u201cFilch\u2019ll have me there all night,\u201d said Ron heavily. \u201cNo magic! There must be about a hundred cups in that room. I\u2019m no good at Muggle cleaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d swap anytime,\u201d said Harry hollowly. \u201cI\u2019ve had loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart\u2019s fan mail . . . he\u2019ll be a nightmare. . . .\u201d\n\nSaturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart\u2019s office. He gritted his teeth and knocked.\n\nThe door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him.\n\n\u201cAh, here\u2019s the scalawag!\u201d he said. \u201cCome in, Harry, come in \u2014\u201d\n\nShining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another large pile lay on his desk.\n\n\u201cYou can address the envelopes!\u201d Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat. \u201cThis first one\u2019s to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her \u2014 huge fan of mine \u2014\u201d\n\nThe minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart\u2019s voice wash over him, occasionally saying, \u201cMmm\u201d and \u201cRight\u201d and \u201cYeah.\u201d Now and then he caught a phrase like, \u201cFame\u2019s a fickle friend, Harry,\u201d or \u201cCelebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.\u201d\n\nThe candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley\u2019s address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly time. . . .\n\nAnd then he heard something \u2014 something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart\u2019s prattle about his fans.\n\nIt was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.\n\n\u201cCome . . . come to me. . . . Let me rip you. . . . Let me tear you. . . . Let me kill you. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley\u2019s street.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said loudly.\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d said Lockhart. \u201cSix solid months at the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry frantically. \u201cThat voice!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d said Lockhart, looking puzzled. \u201cWhat voice?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat \u2014 that voice that said \u2014 didn\u2019t you hear it?\u201d\n\nLockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you\u2019re getting a little drowsy? Great Scott \u2014 look at the time! We\u2019ve been here nearly four hours! I\u2019d never have believed it \u2014 the time\u2019s flown, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn\u2019t expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry left.\n\nIt was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn\u2019t back yet. Harry pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room.\n\n\u201cMy muscles have all seized up,\u201d he groaned, sinking on his bed. \u201cFourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch Cup before he was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off. . . . How was it with Lockhart?\u201d\n\nKeeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard.\n\n\u201cAnd Lockhart said he couldn\u2019t hear it?\u201d said Ron. Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight. \u201cD\u2019you think he was lying? But I don\u2019t get it \u2014 even someone invisible would\u2019ve had to open the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him. \u201cI don\u2019t get it either.\u201d"}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter8": "THE DEATHDAY PARTY\n\n\n\n\nOctober arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup Potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire.\n\nRaindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid\u2019s pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood\u2019s enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.\n\nEven aside from the rain and wind it hadn\u2019t been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles.\n\nAs Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, \u201c. . . don\u2019t fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, Nick,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHello, hello,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.\n\n\u201cYou look troubled, young Potter,\u201d said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.\n\n\u201cSo do you,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \u201ca matter of no importance. . . . It\u2019s not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I\u2019d apply, but apparently I \u2018don\u2019t fulfill requirements\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\nIn spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.\n\n\u201cBut you would think, wouldn\u2019t you,\u201d he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, \u201cthat getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 yes,\u201d said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.\n\n\u201cI mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However \u2014\u201d Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously:\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2018We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.\n\n\u201cHalf an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that\u2019s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it\u2019s not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.\u201d\n\nNearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, \u201cSo \u2014 what\u2019s bothering you? Anything I can do?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNot unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly \u2014\u201d\n\nThe rest of Harry\u2019s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get out of here, Harry,\u201d said Nick quickly. \u201cFilch isn\u2019t in a good mood \u2014 he\u2019s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He\u2019s been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry\u2019s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple.\n\n\u201cFilth!\u201d he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry\u2019s Quidditch robes. \u201cMess and muck everywhere! I\u2019ve had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!\u201d\n\nSo Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor.\n\nHarry had never been inside Filch\u2019s office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch\u2019s desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.\n\nFilch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment.\n\n\u201cDung,\u201d he muttered furiously, \u201cgreat sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains . . . rat intestines . . . I\u2019ve had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where\u2019s the form . . . yes . . .\u201d\n\nHe retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.\n\n\u201cName . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was only a bit of mud!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it\u2019s an extra hour scrubbing!\u201d shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. \u201cCrime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . .\u201d\n\nDabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry, who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.\n\nBut as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle.\n\n\u201cPEEVES!\u201d Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. \u201cI\u2019ll have you this time, I\u2019ll have you!\u201d\n\nAnd without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.\n\nPeeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn\u2019t much like Peeves, but couldn\u2019t help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he\u2019d wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry.\n\nThinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn\u2019t on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read:\n\nKWIKSPELL\n\n_____________________________________\n\nA Correspondence Course in Beginners\u2019 Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nIntrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said:\n\n\n\nFeel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork?\n\nThere is an answer!\n\n\n\nKwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method!\n\n\n\nMadam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes:\n\n\u201cI had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!\u201d\n\n\n\nWarlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says:\n\n\u201cMy wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!\u201d\n\n\n\nFascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope\u2019s contents. Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn\u2019t a proper wizard? Harry was just reading \u201cLesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)\u201d when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened.\n\nFilch was looking triumphant.\n\n\u201cThat Vanishing Cabinet was extremely valuable!\u201d he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. \u201cWe\u2019ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet \u2014\u201d\n\nHis eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.\n\nFilch\u2019s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer.\n\n\u201cHave you \u2014 did you read \u2014 ?\u201d he sputtered.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry lied quickly.\n\nFilch\u2019s knobbly hands were twisting together.\n\n\u201cIf I thought you\u2019d read my private \u2014 not that it\u2019s mine \u2014 for a friend \u2014 be that as it may \u2014 however \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn\u2019t help.\n\n\u201cVery well \u2014 go \u2014 and don\u2019t breathe a word \u2014 not that \u2014 however, if you didn\u2019t read \u2014 go now, I have to write up Peeves\u2019 report \u2014 go \u2014\u201d\n\nAmazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from Filch\u2019s office without punishment was probably some kind of school record.\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry! Did it work?\u201d\n\nNearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height.\n\n\u201cI persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch\u2019s office,\u201d said Nick eagerly. \u201cThought it might distract him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWas that you?\u201d said Harry gratefully. \u201cYeah, it worked, I didn\u2019t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!\u201d\n\nThey set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick\u2019s rejection letter.\n\n\u201cI wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\u201d Harry said.\n\nNearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him. He wished he hadn\u2019t; it was like stepping through an icy shower.\n\n\u201cBut there is something you could do for me,\u201d said Nick excitedly. \u201cHarry \u2014 would I be asking too much \u2014 but no, you wouldn\u2019t want \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course \u2014 but I daresay you\u2019d rather go to the school feast?\u201d He watched Harry on tenterhooks.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry quickly, \u201cI\u2019ll come \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And\u201d \u2014 he hesitated, looking excited \u2014 \u201cdo you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf \u2014 of course,\u201d said Harry.\n\nNearly Headless Nick beamed at him.\n\n\u201cA deathday party?\u201d said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room. \u201cI bet there aren\u2019t many living people who can say they\u2019ve been to one of those \u2014 it\u2019ll be fascinating!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?\u201d said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \u201cSounds dead depressing to me. . . .\u201d\n\nRain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \u201crescued\u201d the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people.\n\nHarry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander\u2019s mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry\u2019s mind.\n\nBy the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid\u2019s vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.\n\n\u201cA promise is a promise,\u201d Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \u201cYou said you\u2019d go to the deathday party.\u201d\n\nSo at seven o\u2019clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.\n\nThe passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick\u2019s party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.\n\n\u201cIs that supposed to be music?\u201d Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.\n\n\u201cMy dear friends,\u201d he said mournfully. \u201cWelcome, welcome . . . so pleased you could come. . . .\u201d\n\nHe swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.\n\nIt was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.\n\n\u201cShall we have a look around?\u201d Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet.\n\n\u201cCareful not to walk through anyone,\u201d said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn\u2019t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \u201cTurn back, turn back, I don\u2019t want to talk to Moaning Myrtle \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d said Harry as they backtracked quickly.\n\n\u201cShe haunts one of the toilets in the girls\u2019 bathroom on the first floor,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cShe haunts a toilet?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s been out of order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it\u2019s awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, food!\u201d said Ron.\n\nOn the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words,\n\n\n\nSIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON\n\nDIED 31ST OCTOBER, 1492\n\n\n\nHarry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.\n\n\u201cCan you taste it if you walk through it?\u201d Harry asked him.\n\n\u201cAlmost,\u201d said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.\n\n\u201cI expect they\u2019ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\u201d said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.\n\n\u201cCan we move? I feel sick,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThey had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.\n\n\u201cHello, Peeves,\u201d said Harry cautiously.\n\nUnlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.\n\n\u201cNibbles?\u201d he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus.\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cHeard you talking about poor Myrtle,\u201d said Peeves, his eyes dancing. \u201cRude you was about poor Myrtle.\u201d He took a deep breath and bellowed, \u201cOI! MYRTLE!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, Peeves, don\u2019t tell her what I said, she\u2019ll be really upset,\u201d Hermione whispered frantically. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it, I don\u2019t mind her \u2014 er, hello, Myrtle.\u201d\n\nThe squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said sulkily.\n\n\u201cHow are you, Myrtle?\u201d said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you out of the toilet.\u201d\n\nMyrtle sniffed.\n\n\u201cMiss Granger was just talking about you \u2014\u201d said Peeves slyly in Myrtle\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cJust saying \u2014 saying \u2014 how nice you look tonight,\u201d said Hermione, glaring at Peeves.\n\nMyrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me,\u201d she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 honestly \u2014 didn\u2019t I just say how nice Myrtle\u2019s looking?\u201d said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. \u201cD\u2019you think I don\u2019t know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten pimply,\u201d Peeves hissed in her ear.\n\nMoaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, \u201cPimply! Pimply!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, dear,\u201d said Hermione sadly.\n\nNearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.\n\n\u201cEnjoying yourselves?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d they lied.\n\n\u201cNot a bad turnout,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. \u201cThe Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It\u2019s nearly time for my speech, I\u2019d better go and warn the orchestra. . . .\u201d\n\nThe orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded.\n\n\u201cOh, here we go,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.\n\nThrough the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick\u2019s face.\n\nThe horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck.\n\n\u201cNick!\u201d he roared. \u201cHow are you? Head still hanging in there?\u201d\n\nHe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cWelcome, Patrick,\u201d said Nick stiffly.\n\n\u201cLive \u2019uns!\u201d said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).\n\n\u201cVery amusing,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind Nick!\u201d shouted Sir Patrick\u2019s head from the floor. \u201cStill upset we won\u2019t let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say \u2014 look at the fellow \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, \u201cNick\u2019s very \u2014 frightening and \u2014 er \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d yelled Sir Patrick\u2019s head. \u201cBet he asked you to say that!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I could have everyone\u2019s attention, it\u2019s time for my speech!\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight.\n\n\u201cMy late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . .\u201d\n\nBut nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd was turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick\u2019s head went sailing past him to loud cheers.\n\nHarry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand much more of this,\u201d Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Harry agreed.\n\nThey backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles.\n\n\u201cPudding might not be finished yet,\u201d said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall.\n\nAnd then Harry heard it.\n\n\u201c. . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . .\u201d\n\nIt was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart\u2019s office.\n\nHe stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.\n\n\u201cHarry, what\u2019re you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that voice again \u2014 shut up a minute \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.\n\n\u201c. . . kill . . . time to kill . . .\u201d\n\nThe voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away \u2014 moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn\u2019t matter?\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.\n\n\u201cHarry, what\u2019re we \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSHH!\u201d\n\nHarry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: \u201c. . . I smell blood. . . . I SMELL BLOOD!\u201d\n\nHis stomach lurched \u2014\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to kill someone!\u201d he shouted, and ignoring Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps \u2014\n\nHarry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage.\n\n\u201cHarry, what was that all about?\u201d said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear anything. . . .\u201d\n\nBut Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d\n\nSomething was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches.\n\n\n\nTHE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that thing \u2014 hanging underneath?\u201d said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice.\n\nAs they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped \u2014 there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash.\n\nMrs. Norris, the caretaker\u2019s cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.\n\nFor a few seconds, they didn\u2019t move. Then Ron said, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we try and help \u2014\u201d Harry began awkwardly.\n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be found here.\u201d\n\nBut it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.\n\nThe chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.\n\nThen someone shouted through the quiet.\n\n\u201cEnemies of the Heir, beware! You\u2019ll be next, Mudbloods!\u201d\n\nIt was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter9": "THE WRITING ON THE WALL\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nAttracted no doubt by Malfoy\u2019s shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror.\n\n\u201cMy cat! My cat! What\u2019s happened to Mrs. Norris?\u201d he shrieked.\n\nAnd his popping eyes fell on Harry.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d he screeched. \u201cYou! You\u2019ve murdered my cat! You\u2019ve killed her! I\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019ll \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cArgus!\u201d\n\nDumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.\n\n\u201cCome with me, Argus,\u201d he said to Filch. \u201cYou, too, Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.\u201d\n\nLockhart stepped forward eagerly.\n\n\u201cMy office is nearest, Headmaster \u2014 just upstairs \u2014 please feel free \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Gilderoy,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nThe silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape.\n\nAs they entered Lockhart\u2019s darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore laid Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching.\n\nThe tip of Dumbledore\u2019s long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs. Norris\u2019s fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a curse that killed her \u2014 probably the Transmogrifian Torture \u2014 I\u2019ve seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn\u2019t there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved her. . . .\u201d\n\nLockhart\u2019s comments were punctuated by Filch\u2019s dry, racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself. If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled for sure.\n\nDumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand, but nothing happened: She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.\n\n\u201c. . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,\u201d said Lockhart, \u201ca series of attacks, the full story\u2019s in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at once. . . .\u201d\n\nThe photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net.\n\nAt last Dumbledore straightened up.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not dead, Argus,\u201d he said softly.\n\nLockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented.\n\n\u201cNot dead?\u201d choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. \u201cBut why\u2019s she all \u2014 all stiff and frozen?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has been Petrified,\u201d said Dumbledore (\u201cAh! I thought so!\u201d said Lockhart). \u201cBut how, I cannot say. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk him!\u201d shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry.\n\n\u201cNo second year could have done this,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly. \u201cIt would take Dark Magic of the most advanced \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did it, he did it!\u201d Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. \u201cYou saw what he wrote on the wall! He found \u2014 in my office \u2014 he knows I\u2019m a \u2014 I\u2019m a \u2014\u201d Filch\u2019s face worked horribly. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m a Squib!\u201d he finished.\n\n\u201cI never touched Mrs. Norris!\u201d Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even know what a Squib is.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish!\u201d snarled Filch. \u201cHe saw my Kwikspell letter!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I might speak, Headmaster,\u201d said Snape from the shadows, and Harry\u2019s sense of foreboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good.\n\n\u201cPotter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it. \u201cBut we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn\u2019t he at the Halloween feast?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. \u201c. . . there were hundreds of ghosts, they\u2019ll tell you we were there \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why not join the feast afterward?\u201d said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. \u201cWhy go up to that corridor?\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione looked at Harry.\n\n\u201cBecause \u2014 because \u2014\u201d Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, \u201cbecause we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWithout any supper?\u201d said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face. \u201cI didn\u2019t think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t hungry,\u201d said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble.\n\nSnape\u2019s nasty smile widened.\n\n\u201cI suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, Severus,\u201d said Professor McGonagall sharply, \u201cI see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn\u2019t hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nDumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling light-blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.\n\n\u201cInnocent until proven guilty, Severus,\u201d he said firmly.\n\nSnape looked furious. So did Filch.\n\n\u201cMy cat has been Petrified!\u201d he shrieked, his eyes popping. \u201cI want to see some punishment!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be able to cure her, Argus,\u201d said Dumbledore patiently. \u201cProfessor Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it,\u201d Lockhart butted in. \u201cI must have done it a hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Snape icily. \u201cBut I believe I am the Potions master at this school.\u201d\n\nThere was a very awkward pause.\n\n\u201cYou may go,\u201d Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\nThey went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When they were a floor up from Lockhart\u2019s office, they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted at his friends\u2019 darkened faces.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, without hesitation. \u201cHearing voices no one else can hear isn\u2019t a good sign, even in the Wizarding world.\u201d\n\nSomething in Ron\u2019s voice made Harry ask, \u201cYou do believe me, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course I do,\u201d said Ron quickly. \u201cBut \u2014 you must admit it\u2019s weird. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s weird,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe whole thing\u2019s weird. What was that writing on the wall about? The Chamber Has Been Opened. . . . What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, it rings a sort of bell,\u201d said Ron slowly. \u201cI think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once . . . might\u2019ve been Bill. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what on earth\u2019s a Squib?\u201d said Harry.\n\nTo his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 it\u2019s not funny really \u2014 but as it\u2019s Filch,\u201d he said. \u201cA Squib is someone who was born into a Wizarding family but hasn\u2019t got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch\u2019s trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates students so much.\u201d Ron gave a satisfied smile. \u201cHe\u2019s bitter.\u201d\n\nA clock chimed somewhere.\n\n\u201cMidnight,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe\u2019d better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else.\u201d\n\nFor a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone\u2019s minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower\u2019s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn\u2019t guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like \u201cbreathing loudly\u201d and \u201clooking happy.\u201d\n\nGinny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris\u2019s fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.\n\n\u201cBut you haven\u2019t really got to know Mrs. Norris,\u201d Ron told her bracingly. \u201cHonestly, we\u2019re much better off without her.\u201d Ginny\u2019s lip trembled. \u201cStuff like this doesn\u2019t often happen at Hogwarts,\u201d Ron assured her. \u201cThey\u2019ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he\u2019s got time to Petrify Filch before he\u2019s expelled. I\u2019m only joking \u2014\u201d Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.\n\nThe attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.\n\nHarry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.\n\nHarry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a three-foot-long composition on \u201cThe Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, I\u2019m still eight inches short. . . .\u201d said Ron furiously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll. \u201cAnd Hermione\u2019s done four feet seven inches and her writing\u2019s tiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework.\n\n\u201cSomewhere over there,\u201d said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \u201cLooking for another book. I think she\u2019s trying to read the whole library before Christmas.\u201d\n\nHarry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.\n\n\u201cDunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,\u201d said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. \u201cAll that junk about Lockhart being so great \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them.\n\n\u201cAll the copies of Hogwarts: A History have been taken out,\u201d she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn\u2019t left my copy at home, but I couldn\u2019t fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you want it?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThe same reason everyone else wants it,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cto read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I can\u2019t remember,\u201d said Hermione, biting her lip. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t find the story anywhere else \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, let me read your composition,\u201d said Ron desperately, checking his watch.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione, suddenly severe. \u201cYou\u2019ve had ten days to finish it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI only need another two inches, come on \u2014\u201d\n\nThe bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering.\n\nHistory of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn\u2019t noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staffroom fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.\n\nToday was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.\n\nProfessor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.\n\n\u201cMiss \u2014 er \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cGranger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,\u201d said Hermione in a clear voice.\n\nDean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown\u2019s head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom\u2019s elbow slipped off his desk.\n\nProfessor Binns blinked.\n\n\u201cMy subject is History of Magic,\u201d he said in his dry, wheezy voice. \u201cI deal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\u201d He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk snapping and continued, \u201cIn September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers \u2014\u201d\n\nHe stuttered to a halt. Hermione\u2019s hand was waving in the air again.\n\n\u201cMiss Grant?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, sir, don\u2019t legends always have a basis in fact?\u201d\n\nProfessor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Professor Binns slowly, \u201cyes, one could argue that, I suppose.\u201d He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before. \u201cHowever, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns\u2019s every word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.\n\n\u201cOh, very well,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cLet me see . . . the Chamber of Secrets . . .\n\n\u201cYou all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago \u2014 the precise date is uncertain \u2014 by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\u201d\n\nHe paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.\n\n\u201cFor a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.\u201d\n\nProfessor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise.\n\n\u201cReliable historical sources tell us this much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing.\n\n\u201cSlytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.\u201d\n\nThere was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn\u2019t the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns\u2019s classes. There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale told to frighten the gullible.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s hand was back in the air.\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 what exactly do you mean by the \u2018horror within\u2019 the Chamber?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,\u201d said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy voice.\n\nThe class exchanged nervous looks.\n\n\u201cI tell you, the thing does not exist,\u201d said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes. \u201cThere is no Chamber and no monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, sir,\u201d said Seamus Finnigan, \u201cif the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin\u2019s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense, O\u2019Flaherty,\u201d said Professor Binns in an aggravated tone. \u201cIf a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses haven\u2019t found the thing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Professor,\u201d piped up Parvati Patil, \u201cyou\u2019d probably have to use Dark Magic to open it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because a wizard doesn\u2019t use Dark Magic doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t, Miss Pennyfeather,\u201d snapped Professor Binns. \u201cI repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut maybe you\u2019ve got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn\u2019t \u2014\u201d began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough.\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cIt is a myth! It does not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable fact!\u201d\n\nAnd within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.\n\n\u201cI always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,\u201d Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. \u201cBut I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn\u2019t be in his House if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I\u2019d\u2019ve got the train straight back home. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn\u2019t say anything. His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly.\n\nHarry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he\u2019d placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great, you know, it\u2019s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. . . .\n\nBut Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House\u2019s reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not Slytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you\u2019re sure . . . better be Gryffindor. . . .\n\nAs they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevey went past.\n\n\u201cHiya, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cHullo, Colin,\u201d said Harry automatically.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 Harry \u2014 a boy in my class has been saying you\u2019re \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Colin was so small he couldn\u2019t fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, \u201cSee you, Harry!\u201d and he was gone.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a boy in his class saying about you?\u201d Hermione wondered.\n\n\u201cThat I\u2019m Slytherin\u2019s heir, I expect,\u201d said Harry, his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime.\n\n\u201cPeople here\u2019ll believe anything,\u201d said Ron in disgust.\n\nThe crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you really think there\u2019s a Chamber of Secrets?\u201d Ron asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cDumbledore couldn\u2019t cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be \u2014 well \u2014 human.\u201d\n\nAs she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where Filch has been keeping guard,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\nThey looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t hurt to have a poke around,\u201d said Harry, dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues.\n\n\u201cScorch marks!\u201d he said. \u201cHere \u2014 and here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCome and look at this!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThis is funny. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.\n\n\u201cHave you ever seen spiders act like that?\u201d said Hermione wonderingly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201chave you, Ron? Ron?\u201d\n\nHe looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 like \u2014 spiders,\u201d said Ron tensely.\n\n\u201cI never knew that,\u201d said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ve used spiders in Potions loads of times. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind them dead,\u201d said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the way they move. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione giggled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d said Ron, fiercely. \u201cIf you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my \u2014 my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick. . . . You wouldn\u2019t like them either if you\u2019d been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and . . .\u201d\n\nHe broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, \u201cRemember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone\u2019s mopped it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was about here,\u201d said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch\u2019s chair and pointing. \u201cLevel with this door.\u201d\n\nHe reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he\u2019d been burned.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t go in there,\u201d said Ron gruffly. \u201cThat\u2019s a girls\u2019 toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Ron, there won\u2019t be anyone in there,\u201d said Hermione, standing up and coming over. \u201cThat\u2019s Moaning Myrtle\u2019s place. Come on, let\u2019s have a look.\u201d\n\nAnd ignoring the large OUT OF ORDER sign, she opened the door.\n\nIt was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges.\n\nHermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall. When she reached it she said, \u201cHello, Myrtle, how are you?\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.\n\n\u201cThis is a girls\u2019 bathroom,\u201d she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously. \u201cThey\u2019re not girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hermione agreed. \u201cI just wanted to show them how \u2014 er \u2014 nice it is in here.\u201d\n\nShe waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.\n\n\u201cAsk her if she saw anything,\u201d Harry mouthed at Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat are you whispering?\u201d said Myrtle, staring at him.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cWe wanted to ask \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish people would stop talking behind my back!\u201d said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. \u201cI do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMyrtle, no one wants to upset you,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHarry only \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one wants to upset me! That\u2019s a good one!\u201d howled Myrtle. \u201cMy life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to ask you if you\u2019ve seen anything funny lately,\u201d said Hermione quickly. \u201cBecause a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see anyone near here that night?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t paying attention,\u201d said Myrtle dramatically. \u201cPeeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself. Then, of course, I remembered that I\u2019m \u2014 that I\u2019m \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready dead,\u201d said Ron helpfully.\n\nMyrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.\n\nHarry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, \u201cHonestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle. . . . Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nHarry had barely closed the door on Myrtle\u2019s gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump.\n\n\u201cRON!\u201d\n\nPercy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a girls\u2019 bathroom!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhat were you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust having a look around,\u201d Ron shrugged. \u201cClues, you know \u2014\u201d\n\nPercy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cGet \u2014 away \u2014 from \u2014 there \u2014\u201d Percy said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone\u2019s at dinner \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we be here?\u201d said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy. \u201cListen, we never laid a finger on that cat!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I told Ginny,\u201d said Percy fiercely, \u201cbut she still seems to think you\u2019re going to be expelled, I\u2019ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t care about Ginny,\u201d said Ron, whose ears were now reddening. \u201cYou\u2019re just worried I\u2019m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFive points from Gryffindor!\u201d Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge. \u201cAnd I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or I\u2019ll write to Mum!\u201d\n\nAnd he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron\u2019s ears.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry\u2019s surprise, Hermione followed suit.\n\n\u201cWho can it be, though?\u201d she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. \u201cWho\u2019d want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s think,\u201d said Ron in mock puzzlement. \u201cWho do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?\u201d\n\nHe looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Malfoy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I am!\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou heard him \u2014 \u2018You\u2019ll be next, Mudbloods!\u2019 \u2014 come on, you\u2019ve only got to look at his foul rat face to know it\u2019s him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?\u201d said Hermione skeptically.\n\n\u201cLook at his family,\u201d said Harry, closing his books, too. \u201cThe whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he\u2019s always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin\u2019s descendants. His father\u2019s definitely evil enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey could\u2019ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!\u201d said Ron. \u201cHanding it down, father to son. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione cautiously, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how do we prove it?\u201d said Harry darkly.\n\n\u201cThere might be a way,\u201d said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. \u201cOf course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We\u2019d be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Ron irritably.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Hermione coldly. \u201cWhat we\u2019d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it\u2019s us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible,\u201d Harry said as Ron laughed.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAll we\u2019d need would be some Polyjuice Potion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Ron and Harry together.\n\n\u201cSnape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think we\u2019ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?\u201d muttered Ron.\n\n\u201cIt transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He\u2019s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,\u201d said Ron, frowning. \u201cWhat if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wears off after a while,\u201d said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently. \u201cBut getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it\u2019s bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.\u201d\n\nThere was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher.\n\n\u201cHard to see why we\u2019d want the book, really,\u201d said Ron, \u201cif we weren\u2019t going to try and make one of the potions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cthat if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on, no teacher\u2019s going to fall for that,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey\u2019d have to be really thick. . . .\u201d"}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter10": "THE ROGUE BLUDGER\n\n\n\n\nSince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.\n\nHarry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf. If he hadn\u2019t had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would have refused to do it.\n\n\u201cNice loud howl, Harry \u2014 exactly \u2014 and then, if you\u2019ll believe it, I pounced \u2014 like this \u2014 slammed him to the floor \u2014 thus \u2014 with one hand, I managed to hold him down \u2014 with my other, I put my wand to his throat \u2014 I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm \u2014 he let out a piteous moan \u2014 go on, Harry \u2014 higher than that \u2014 good \u2014 the fur vanished \u2014 the fangs shrank \u2014 and he turned back into a man. Simple, yet effective \u2014 and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.\u201d\n\nThe bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.\n\n\u201cHomework \u2014 compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!\u201d\n\nThe class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Harry muttered.\n\n\u201cWait till everyone\u2019s gone,\u201d said Hermione nervously. \u201cAll right . . .\u201d\n\nShe approached Lockhart\u2019s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 Professor Lockhart?\u201d Hermione stammered. \u201cI wanted to \u2014 to get this book out of the library. Just for background reading.\u201d She held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. \u201cBut the thing is, it\u2019s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it \u2014 I\u2019m sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Gadding with Ghouls!\u201d said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her. \u201cPossibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Hermione eagerly. \u201cSo clever, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help,\u201d said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill. \u201cYes, nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron\u2019s face. \u201cI usually save it for book signings.\u201d\n\nHe scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to Hermione.\n\n\u201cSo, Harry,\u201d said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear you\u2019re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even look at the book we wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s a brainless git,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut who cares, we\u2019ve got what we needed \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not a brainless git,\u201d said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library.\n\n\u201cJust because he said you were the best student of the year \u2014\u201d\n\nThey dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture.\n\n\u201cMoste Potente Potions?\u201d she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn\u2019t let go.\n\n\u201cI was wondering if I could keep it,\u201d she said breathlessly.\n\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you another autograph. Lockhart\u2019ll sign anything if it stands still long enough.\u201d\n\nMadam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.\n\nFive minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle\u2019s out-of-order bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron\u2019s objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she them.\n\nHermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.\n\n\u201cHere it is,\u201d said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces.\n\n\u201cThis is the most complicated potion I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Hermione as they scanned the recipe. \u201cLacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,\u201d she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. \u201cWell, they\u2019re easy enough, they\u2019re in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. . . . Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn \u2014 don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to get that \u2014 shredded skin of a boomslang \u2014 that\u2019ll be tricky, too \u2014 and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d said Ron sharply. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, a bit of whoever we\u2019re changing into? I\u2019m drinking nothing with Crabbe\u2019s toenails in it \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione continued as though she hadn\u2019t heard him.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits last. . . .\u201d\n\nRon turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you realize how much we\u2019re going to have to steal, Hermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that\u2019s definitely not in the students\u2019 cupboard. What\u2019re we going to do, break into Snape\u2019s private stores? I don\u2019t know if this is a good idea. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione shut the book with a snap.\n\n\u201cWell, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,\u201d she said. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. \u201cI don\u2019t want to break rules, you know. I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don\u2019t want to find out if it\u2019s Malfoy, I\u2019ll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when you\u2019d be persuading us to break rules,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAll right, we\u2019ll do it. But not toenails, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long will it take to make, anyway?\u201d said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again.\n\n\u201cWell, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days . . . I\u2019d say it\u2019d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.\u201d\n\n\u201cA month?\u201d said Ron. \u201cMalfoy could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!\u201d But Hermione\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, \u201cBut it\u2019s the best plan we\u2019ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.\u201d\n\nHowever, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, \u201cIt\u2019ll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHarry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much.\n\nAs eleven o\u2019clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood\u2019s usual pre-match pep talk.\n\n\u201cSlytherin has better brooms than us,\u201d he began. \u201cNo point denying it. But we\u2019ve got better people on our brooms. We\u2019ve trained harder than they have, we\u2019ve been flying in all weathers \u2014\u201d (\u201cToo true,\u201d muttered George Weasley. \u201cI haven\u2019t been properly dry since August\u201d) \u201c\u2014 and we\u2019re going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.\u201d\n\nChest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we\u2019ve got to win today, we\u2019ve got to.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo no pressure, Harry,\u201d said Fred, winking at him.\n\nAs they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.\n\n\u201cOn my whistle,\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cThree . . . two . . . one . . .\u201d\n\nWith a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch.\n\n\u201cAll right there, Scarhead?\u201d yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom.\n\nHarry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed.\n\n\u201cClose one, Harry!\u201d said George, streaking past him with his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again.\n\nHarry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry\u2019s head.\n\nHarry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What was going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible. . . .\n\nFred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course.\n\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed.\n\nIt had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face, splattering onto his glasses. He didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, \u201cSlytherin lead, sixty points to zero \u2014\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins\u2019 superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s \u2014 tampered \u2014 with \u2014 this \u2014 Bludger \u2014\u201d Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on Harry.\n\n\u201cWe need time out,\u201d said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry\u2019s nose at the same time.\n\nWood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch\u2019s whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \u201cWe\u2019re being flattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,\u201d said George angrily. \u201cSomeone\u2019s fixed it \u2014 it won\u2019t leave Harry alone. It hasn\u2019t gone for anyone else all game. The Slytherins must have done something to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch\u2019s office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then. . . .\u201d said Wood, anxiously.\n\nMadam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, \u201cwith you two flying around me all the time the only way I\u2019m going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be thick,\u201d said Fred. \u201cIt\u2019ll take your head off.\u201d\n\nWood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.\n\n\u201cOliver, this is insane,\u201d said Alicia Spinnet angrily. \u201cYou can\u2019t let Harry deal with that thing on his own. Let\u2019s ask for an inquiry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we stop now, we\u2019ll have to forfeit the match!\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is all your fault,\u201d George said angrily to Wood. \u201c\u2018Get the Snitch or die trying,\u2019 what a stupid thing to tell him \u2014\u201d\n\nMadam Hooch had joined them.\n\n\u201cReady to resume play?\u201d she asked Wood.\n\nWood looked at the determined look on Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cFred, George, you heard Harry \u2014 leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own.\u201d\n\nThe rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch\u2019s whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn\u2019t change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goalposts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood \u2014\n\nA whistling in Harry\u2019s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.\n\n\u201cTraining for the ballet, Potter?\u201d yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it \u2014 the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches above Malfoy\u2019s left ear \u2014 and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn\u2019t seen it.\n\nFor an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.\n\nWHAM.\n\nHe had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side \u2014 the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time aiming at his face \u2014 Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy.\n\nThrough a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him.\n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014\u201d he gasped, careening out of Harry\u2019s way.\n\nHarry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out.\n\nWith a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.\n\n\u201cAha,\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cWe\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\nAnd he fainted.\n\nHe came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth.\n\n\u201cOh, no, not you,\u201d he moaned.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying,\u201d said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. \u201cNot to worry, Harry. I\u2019m about to fix your arm.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it like this, thanks. . . .\u201d\n\nHe tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a photo of this, Colin,\u201d he said loudly.\n\n\u201cLie back, Harry,\u201d said Lockhart soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple charm I\u2019ve used countless times \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just go to the hospital wing?\u201d said Harry through clenched teeth.\n\n\u201cHe should really, Professor,\u201d said a muddy Wood, who couldn\u2019t help grinning even though his Seeker was injured. \u201cGreat capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, I\u2019d say \u2014\u201d\n\nThrough the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific fight.\n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014\u201d said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry\u2019s arm.\n\nA strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry\u2019s shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was being deflated. He didn\u2019t dare look at what was happening. He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly. His arm didn\u2019t hurt anymore \u2014 nor did it feel remotely like an arm.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Lockhart. \u201cYes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. That\u2019s the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing \u2014 ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? \u2014 and Madam Pomfrey will be able to \u2014 er \u2014 tidy you up a bit.\u201d\n\nAs Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again.\n\nPoking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.\n\nLockhart hadn\u2019t mended Harry\u2019s bones. He had removed them.\n\nMadam Pomfrey wasn\u2019t at all pleased.\n\n\u201cYou should have come straight to me!\u201d she raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. \u201cI can mend bones in a second \u2014 but growing them back \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be able to, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Harry desperately.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to stay the night. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry\u2019s bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve.\n\n\u201cHow can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?\u201d Ron called through the curtain as he pulled Harry\u2019s limp fingers through the cuff. \u201cIf Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone can make a mistake,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, does it, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, getting into bed. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t do anything else either.\u201d\n\nAs he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.\n\nHermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in for a rough night,\u201d she said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him. \u201cRegrowing bones is a nasty business.\u201d\n\nSo was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry\u2019s mouth and throat as it went down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water.\n\n\u201cWe won, though,\u201d said Ron, a grin breaking across his face. \u201cThat was some catch you made. Malfoy\u2019s face . . . he looked ready to kill. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know how he fixed that Bludger,\u201d said Hermione darkly.\n\n\u201cWe can add that to the list of questions we\u2019ll ask him when we\u2019ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,\u201d said Harry, sinking back onto his pillows. \u201cI hope it tastes better than this stuff. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s got bits of Slytherins in it? You\u2019ve got to be joking,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThe door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable flying, Harry,\u201d said George. \u201cI\u2019ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn\u2019t seem too happy.\u201d\n\nThey had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry\u2019s bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over, shouting, \u201cThis boy needs rest, he\u2019s got thirty-three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!\u201d\n\nAnd Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm.\n\nHours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken him. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark.\n\n\u201cGet off!\u201d he said loudly, and then, \u201cDobby!\u201d\n\nThe house-elf\u2019s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness. A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter came back to school,\u201d he whispered miserably. \u201cDobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn\u2019t you heed Dobby? Why didn\u2019t Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train?\u201d\n\nHarry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby\u2019s sponge away.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd how did you know I missed the train?\u201d\n\nDobby\u2019s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion.\n\n\u201cIt was you!\u201d he said slowly. \u201cYou stopped the barrier from letting us through!\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed yes, sir,\u201d said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears flapping. \u201cDobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward\u201d \u2014 he showed Harry ten long, bandaged fingers \u2014 \u201cbut Dobby didn\u2019t care, sir, for he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way!\u201d\n\nHe was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.\n\n\u201cDobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts, he let his master\u2019s dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry slumped back onto his pillows.\n\n\u201cYou nearly got Ron and me expelled,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cYou\u2019d better get lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.\u201d\n\nDobby smiled weakly.\n\n\u201cDobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.\u201d\n\nHe blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself.\n\n\u201cWhy d\u2019you wear that thing, Dobby?\u201d he asked curiously.\n\n\u201cThis, sir?\u201d said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. \u201c\u2019Tis a mark of the house-elf\u2019s enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever.\u201d\n\nDobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, \u201cHarry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Bludger?\u201d said Harry, anger rising once more. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot kill you, sir, never kill you!\u201d said Dobby, shocked. \u201cDobby wants to save Harry Potter\u2019s life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain here, sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, is that all?\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, if Harry Potter only knew!\u201d Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase. \u201cIf he knew what he means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,\u201d he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase. \u201cBut mostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord\u2019s power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the dark days would never end, sir. . . . And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more \u2014\u201d\n\nDobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry\u2019s water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, \u201cBad Dobby, very bad Dobby . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there is a Chamber of Secrets?\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cAnd \u2014 did you say it\u2019s been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!\u201d\n\nHe seized the elf\u2019s bony wrist as Dobby\u2019s hand inched toward the water jug. \u201cBut I\u2019m not Muggle-born \u2014 how can I be in danger from the Chamber?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,\u201d stammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. \u201cDark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen \u2014 go home, Harry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, \u2019tis too dangerous \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is it, Dobby?\u201d Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby\u2019s wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. \u201cWho\u2019s opened it? Who opened it last time?\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby can\u2019t, sir, Dobby can\u2019t, Dobby mustn\u2019t tell!\u201d squealed the elf. \u201cGo home, Harry Potter, go home!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere!\u201d said Harry fiercely. \u201cOne of my best friends is Muggle-born; she\u2019ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter risks his own life for his friends!\u201d moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy. \u201cSo noble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not \u2014\u201d\n\nDobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too. There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside.\n\n\u201cDobby must go!\u201d breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry\u2019s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer.\n\nNext moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.\n\n\u201cGet Madam Pomfrey,\u201d whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry\u2019s bed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress. He heard a sharp intake of breath.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed.\n\n\u201cAnother attack,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cMinerva found him on the stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a bunch of grapes next to him,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cWe think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face.\n\nIt was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him, holding his camera.\n\n\u201cPetrified?\u201d whispered Madam Pomfrey.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cBut I shudder to think . . . If Albus hadn\u2019t been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate \u2014 who knows what might have \u2014\u201d\n\nThe three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin\u2019s rigid grip.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?\u201d said Professor McGonagall eagerly.\n\nDumbledore didn\u2019t answer. He opened the back of the camera.\n\n\u201cGood gracious!\u201d said Madam Pomfrey.\n\nA jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.\n\n\u201cMelted,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. \u201cAll melted . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does this mean, Albus?\u201d Professor McGonagall asked urgently.\n\n\u201cIt means,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cthat the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.\u201d\n\nMadam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cBut, Albus . . . surely . . . who?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is not who,\u201d said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin. \u201cThe question is, how. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall\u2019s shadowy face, she didn\u2019t understand this any better than he did."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter11": "THE DUELING CLUB\n\n\n\n\nHarry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin\u2019s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.\n\n\u201cAll in order,\u201d she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-handed. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve finished eating, you may leave.\u201d\n\nHarry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren\u2019t there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren\u2019t interested in whether he had his bones back or not.\n\nAs Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time they\u2019d met.\n\n\u201cOh, hello, Harry,\u201d he said. \u201cExcellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup \u2014 you earned fifty points!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d said Percy, his smile fading. \u201cI hope Ron\u2019s not in another girls\u2019 toilet. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom. He couldn\u2019t see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione\u2019s eye peering through the keyhole.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d she said. \u201cYou gave us such a fright \u2014 come in \u2014 how\u2019s your arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d\u2019ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,\u201d Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.\u201d\n\nHarry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.\n\n\u201cWe already know \u2014 we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning. That\u2019s why we decided we\u2019d better get going \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,\u201d snarled Ron. \u201cD\u2019you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. \u201cDobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything Dobby had told him \u2014 or hadn\u2019t told him. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open.\n\n\u201cThe Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?\u201d Hermione said.\n\n\u201cThis settles it,\u201d said Ron in a triumphant voice. \u201cLucius Malfoy must\u2019ve opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he\u2019s told dear old Draco how to do it. It\u2019s obvious. Wish Dobby\u2019d told you what kind of monster\u2019s in there, though. I want to know how come nobody\u2019s noticed it sneaking around the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it can make itself invisible,\u201d said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. \u201cOr maybe it can disguise itself \u2014 pretend to be a suit of armor or something \u2014 I\u2019ve read about Chameleon Ghouls \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou read too much, Hermione,\u201d said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry.\n\n\u201cSo Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm. . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou know what, Harry? If he doesn\u2019t stop trying to save your life he\u2019s going to kill you.\u201d\n\nThe news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.\n\nGinny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.\n\nMeanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.\n\n\u201cThey went for Filch first,\u201d Neville said, his round face fearful. \u201cAnd everyone knows I\u2019m almost a Squib.\u201d\n\nIn the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.\n\nUnfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape\u2019s private stores. Harry privately felt he\u2019d rather face Slytherin\u2019s legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.\n\n\u201cWhat we need,\u201d said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon\u2019s double Potions lesson loomed nearer, \u201cis a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape\u2019s office and take what we need.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron looked at her nervously.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d better do the actual stealing,\u201d Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone. \u201cYou two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I\u2019ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.\u201d\n\nHarry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape\u2019s Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.\n\nPotions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon\u2019s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors\u2019 work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape\u2019s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say \u201cUnfair.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things. He was waiting for Hermione\u2019s signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry\u2019s eye and nodded.\n\nHarry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred\u2019s Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle\u2019s cauldron.\n\nGoyle\u2019s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate \u2014 Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cSilence! SILENCE!\u201d Snape roared. \u201cAnyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught \u2014 when I find out who did this \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape\u2019s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.\n\nWhen everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle\u2019s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.\n\n\u201cIf I ever find out who threw this,\u201d Snape whispered, \u201cI shall make sure that person is expelled.\u201d\n\nHarry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome.\n\n\u201cHe knew it was me,\u201d Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom. \u201cI could tell.\u201d\n\nHermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be ready in two weeks,\u201d she said happily.\n\n\u201cSnape can\u2019t prove it was you,\u201d said Ron reassuringly to Harry. \u201cWhat can he do?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnowing Snape, something foul,\u201d said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled.\n\nA week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re starting a Dueling Club!\u201d said Seamus. \u201cFirst meeting tonight! I wouldn\u2019t mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, you reckon Slytherin\u2019s monster can duel?\u201d said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest.\n\n\u201cCould be useful,\u201d he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner. \u201cShall we go?\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o\u2019clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.\n\n\u201cI wonder who\u2019ll be teaching us?\u201d said Hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd. \u201cSomeone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young \u2014 maybe it\u2019ll be him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not \u2014\u201d Harry began, but he ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his usual black.\n\nLockhart waved an arm for silence and called, \u201cGather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent!\n\n\u201cNow, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions \u2014 for full details, see my published works.\n\n\u201cLet me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,\u201d said Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. \u201cHe tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. Now, I don\u2019t want any of you youngsters to worry \u2014 you\u2019ll still have your Potions master when I\u2019m through with him, never fear!\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be good if they finished each other off?\u201d Ron muttered in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\nSnape\u2019s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he\u2019d have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.\n\nLockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them.\n\n\u201cAs you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,\u201d Lockhart told the silent crowd. \u201cOn the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on that,\u201d Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth.\n\n\u201cOne \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014\u201d\n\nBoth of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor.\n\nMalfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s all right?\u201d she squealed through her fingers.\n\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d said Harry and Ron together.\n\nLockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end.\n\n\u201cWell, there you have it!\u201d he said, tottering back onto the platform. \u201cThat was a Disarming Charm \u2014 as you see, I\u2019ve lost my wand \u2014 ah, thank you, Miss Brown \u2014 yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don\u2019t mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy \u2014 however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see . . .\u201d\n\nSnape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, \u201cEnough demonstrating! I\u2019m going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you\u2019d like to help me \u2014\u201d\n\nThey moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first.\n\n\u201cTime to split up the dream team, I think,\u201d he sneered. \u201cWeasley, you can partner Finnigan. Potter \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry moved automatically toward Hermione.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Snape, smiling coldly. \u201cMr. Malfoy, come over here. Let\u2019s see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger \u2014 you can partner Miss Bulstrode.\u201d\n\nMalfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he\u2019d seen in Holidays with Hags. She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return.\n\n\u201cFace your partners!\u201d called Lockhart, back on the platform. \u201cAnd bow!\u201d\n\nHarry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each other.\n\n\u201cWands at the ready!\u201d shouted Lockhart. \u201cWhen I count to three, cast your charms to Disarm your opponents \u2014 only to disarm them \u2014 we don\u2019t want any accidents \u2014 one . . . two . . . three \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on \u201ctwo\u201d: His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he\u2019d been hit over the head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, \u201cRictusempra!\u201d\n\nA jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.\n\n\u201cI said Disarm only!\u201d Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry\u2019s knees, choked, \u201cTarantallegra!\u201d and the next second Harry\u2019s legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep.\n\n\u201cStop! Stop!\u201d screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge.\n\n\u201cFinite Incantatem!\u201d he shouted; Harry\u2019s feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.\n\nA haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger than he was.\n\n\u201cDear, dear,\u201d said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels. \u201cUp you go, Macmillan. . . . Careful there, Miss Fawcett. . . . Pinch it hard, it\u2019ll stop bleeding in a second, Boot \u2014\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,\u201d said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. \u201cLet\u2019s have a volunteer pair \u2014 Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA bad idea, Professor Lockhart,\u201d said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat. \u201cLongbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells. We\u2019ll be sending what\u2019s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox.\u201d Neville\u2019s round, pink face went pinker. \u201cHow about Malfoy and Potter?\u201d said Snape with a twisted smile.\n\n\u201cExcellent idea!\u201d said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.\n\n\u201cNow, Harry,\u201d said Lockhart. \u201cWhen Draco points his wand at you, you do this.\u201d\n\nHe raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, \u201cWhoops \u2014 my wand is a little overexcited \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, \u201cProfessor, could you show me that blocking thing again?\u201d\n\n\u201cScared?\u201d muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn\u2019t hear him.\n\n\u201cYou wish,\u201d said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.\n\nLockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. \u201cJust do what I did, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, drop my wand?\u201d\n\nBut Lockhart wasn\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cThree \u2014 two \u2014 one \u2014 go!\u201d he shouted.\n\nMalfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, \u201cSerpensortia!\u201d\n\nThe end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move, Potter,\u201d said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. \u201cI\u2019ll get rid of it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAllow me!\u201d shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.\n\nHarry wasn\u2019t sure what made him do it. He wasn\u2019t even aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, \u201cLeave him alone!\u201d And miraculously \u2014 inexplicably \u2014 the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn\u2019t attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn\u2019t have explained.\n\nHe looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful \u2014 but certainly not angry and scared.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re playing at?\u201d he shouted, and before Harry could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.\n\nSnape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry didn\u2019t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice in his ear. \u201cMove \u2014 come on \u2014\u201d\n\nRon steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a Parselmouth. Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a what?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cA Parselmouth!\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou can talk to snakes!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s only the second time I\u2019ve ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once \u2014 long story \u2014 but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to \u2014 that was before I knew I was a wizard \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?\u201d Ron repeated faintly.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI bet loads of people here can do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no they can\u2019t,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very common gift. Harry, this is bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s bad?\u201d said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn\u2019t told that snake not to attack Justin \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s what you said to it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean? You were there \u2014 you heard me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard you speaking Parseltongue,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnake language. You could have been saying anything \u2014 no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something \u2014 it was creepy, you know \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry gaped at him.\n\n\u201cI spoke a different language? But \u2014 I didn\u2019t realize \u2014 how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?\u201d\n\nRon shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died. Harry couldn\u2019t see what was so terrible.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you want to tell me what\u2019s wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin\u2019s head?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn\u2019t have to join the Headless Hunt?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters,\u201d said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, \u201cbecause being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That\u2019s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd now the whole school\u2019s going to think you\u2019re his great-great-great-great-grandson or something \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not,\u201d said Harry, with a panic he couldn\u2019t quite explain.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find that hard to prove,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHe lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.\u201d\n\nHarry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered . . .\n\nCould he be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin? He didn\u2019t know anything about his father\u2019s family, after all. The Dursleys had always forbidden questions about his Wizarding relatives.\n\nQuietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words wouldn\u2019t come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it.\n\nBut I\u2019m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn\u2019t have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood. . . .\n\nAh, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don\u2019t you remember?\n\nHarry turned over. He\u2019d see Justin the next day in Herbology and he\u2019d explain that he\u2019d been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.\n\nBy next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.\n\nHarry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.\n\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, exasperated, as one of Ron\u2019s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board. \u201cGo and find Justin if it\u2019s so important to you.\u201d\n\nSo Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where Justin might be.\n\nThe castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of what was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger. Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first.\n\nA group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn\u2019t seem to be working. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation. He couldn\u2019t see whether Justin was among them. He was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section.\n\n\u201cSo anyway,\u201d a stout boy was saying, \u201cI told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter\u2019s marked him down as his next victim, it\u2019s best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin\u2019s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he\u2019d been down for Eton. That\u2019s not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin\u2019s heir on the loose, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?\u201d said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously.\n\n\u201cHannah,\u201d said the stout boy solemnly, \u201che\u2019s a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that\u2019s the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.\u201d\n\nThere was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, \u201cRemember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir, Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch\u2019s cat\u2019s attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud. Next thing we know \u2014 Creevey\u2019s been attacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always seems so nice, though,\u201d said Hannah uncertainly, \u201cand, well, he\u2019s the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can\u2019t be all bad, can he?\u201d\n\nErnie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cNo one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have been blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that.\u201d He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn\u2019t want another Dark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter\u2019s been hiding?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves. If he hadn\u2019t been feeling so angry, he would have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him, and the color was draining out of Ernie\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.\u201d\n\nThe Hufflepuffs\u2019 worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all looked fearfully at Ernie.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want with him?\u201d said Ernie in a quavering voice.\n\n\u201cI wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club,\u201d said Harry.\n\nErnie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, \u201cWe were all there. We saw what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAll I saw,\u201d said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, \u201cwas you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t chase it at him!\u201d Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even touch him!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very near miss,\u201d said Ernie. \u201cAnd in case you\u2019re getting ideas,\u201d he added hastily, \u201cI might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood\u2019s as pure as anyone\u2019s, so \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what sort of blood you\u2019ve got!\u201d said Harry fiercely. \u201cWhy would I want to attack Muggle-borns?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,\u201d said Ernie swiftly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try it.\u201d\n\nHe turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spell book.\n\nHarry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going, he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something very large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.\n\n\u201cOh, hello, Hagrid,\u201d Harry said, looking up.\n\nHagrid\u2019s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered balaclava, but it couldn\u2019t possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive, gloved hands.\n\n\u201cAll righ\u2019, Harry?\u201d he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t yeh in class?\u201d\n\n\u201cCanceled,\u201d said Harry, getting up. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing in here?\u201d\n\nHagrid held up the limp rooster.\n\n\u201cSecond one killed this term,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s either foxes or a Blood-Suckin\u2019 Bugbear, an\u2019 I need the headmaster\u2019s permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.\u201d\n\nHe peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snow-flecked eyebrows.\n\n\u201cYeh sure yeh\u2019re all righ\u2019? Yeh look all hot an\u2019 bothered \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d better get going, Hagrid, it\u2019s Transfiguration next and I\u2019ve got to pick up my books.\u201d\n\nHe walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.\n\n\u201cJustin\u2019s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor.\n\nHe turned to squint at what he\u2019d fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved.\n\nJustin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn\u2019t all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen.\n\nIt was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin\u2019s.\n\nHarry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side.\n\nHe could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But he couldn\u2019t just leave them lying here. . . . He had to get help. . . . Would anyone believe he hadn\u2019t had anything to do with this?\n\nAs he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out.\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s potty wee Potter!\u201d cackled Peeves, knocking Harry\u2019s glasses askew as he bounced past him. \u201cWhat\u2019s Potter up to? Why\u2019s Potter lurking \u2014\u201d\n\nPeeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed, \u201cATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! ATTAAAACK!\u201d\n\nCrash \u2014 crash \u2014 crash \u2014 door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.\n\n\u201cCaught in the act!\u201d Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his finger dramatically at Harry.\n\n\u201cThat will do, Macmillan!\u201d said Professor McGonagall sharply.\n\nPeeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done,\n\nYou\u2019re killing off students, you think it\u2019s good fun \u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Peeves!\u201d barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.\n\nJustin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.\n\n\u201cThis way, Potter,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d said Harry at once, \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is out of my hands, Potter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall curtly.\n\nThey marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.\n\n\u201cLemon drop!\u201d she said. This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn\u2019t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.\n\nHe knew now where he was being taken. This must be where Dumbledore lived."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter12": "THE POLYJUICE POTION\n\n\n\n\nThey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.\n\nHarry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers\u2019 offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore\u2019s was by far the most interesting. If he hadn\u2019t been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it.\n\nIt was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard\u2019s hat \u2014 the Sorting Hat.\n\nHarry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn\u2019t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? Just to see . . . just to make sure it had put him in the right House \u2014\n\nHe walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he\u2019d put it on. Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, \u201cBee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr, yes,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cEr \u2014 sorry to bother you \u2014 I wanted to ask \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\u201d said the hat smartly. \u201cYes . . . you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said before\u201d \u2014 Harry\u2019s heart leapt \u2014 \u201cyou would have done well in Slytherin \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn\u2019t move. Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.\n\nHarry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore\u2019s pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.\n\nHarry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn\u2019t see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoldering pile of ash on the floor.\n\nThe office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d Harry gasped. \u201cYour bird \u2014 I couldn\u2019t do anything \u2014 he just caught fire \u2014\u201d\n\nTo Harry\u2019s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.\n\n\u201cAbout time, too,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s been looking dreadful for days; I\u2019ve been telling him to get a move on.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled at the stunned look on Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cFawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,\u201d said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. \u201cHe\u2019s really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\u201d\n\nIn the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare.\n\nBefore Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019 Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\u201d said Hagrid urgently. \u201cI was talkin\u2019 ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir \u2014\u201d\n\nDumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.\n\n\u201c\u2014 it can\u2019t\u2019ve bin him, I\u2019ll swear it in front o\u2019 the Ministry o\u2019 Magic if I have to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 yeh\u2019ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d said Dumbledore loudly. \u201cI do not think that Harry attacked those people.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll wait outside then, Headmaster.\u201d\n\nAnd he stomped out looking embarrassed.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it was me, Professor?\u201d Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.\n\n\u201cNo, Harry, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again. \u201cBut I still want to talk to you.\u201d\n\nHarry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.\n\n\u201cI must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you\u2019d like to tell me,\u201d he said gently. \u201cAnything at all.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \u201cYou\u2019ll be next, Mudbloods!\u201d and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: \u201cHearing voices no one else can hear isn\u2019t a good sign, even in the Wizarding world.\u201d He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin. . . .\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything, Professor. . . .\u201d\n\nThe double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick\u2019s fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas.\n\n\u201cAt this rate, we\u2019ll be the only ones left,\u201d Ron told Harry and Hermione. \u201cUs, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nCrabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he were about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.\n\nFred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, \u201cMake way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through. . . .\u201d\n\nPercy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.\n\n\u201cIt is not a laughing matter,\u201d he said coldly.\n\n\u201cOh, get out of the way, Percy,\u201d said Fred. \u201cHarry\u2019s in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,\u201d said George, chortling.\n\nGinny didn\u2019t find it amusing either.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t,\u201d she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin\u2019s heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s bursting to say it\u2019s really him,\u201d said Ron knowingly. \u201cYou know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you\u2019re getting all the credit for his dirty work.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot for long,\u201d said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \u201cThe Polyjuice Potion\u2019s nearly ready. We\u2019ll be getting the truth out of him any day now.\u201d\n\nAt last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn\u2019t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.\n\nChristmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.\n\n\u201cWake up,\u201d she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.\n\n\u201cHermione \u2014 you\u2019re not supposed to be in here \u2014\u201d said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas to you, too,\u201d said Hermione, throwing him his present. \u201cI\u2019ve been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\nHarry sat up, suddenly wide awake.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive,\u201d said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron\u2019s four-poster. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, I say it should be tonight.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \u201cAre you speaking to me again?\u201d\n\nShe nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he\u2019d be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.\n\nThe rest of Harry\u2019s Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle toffee, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley\u2019s car (which hadn\u2019t been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.\n\nNo one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.\n\nThe Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn\u2019t noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \u201cPinhead,\u201d kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn\u2019t even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours\u2019 time.\n\nHarry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.\n\n\u201cWe still need a bit of the people you\u2019re changing into,\u201d said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. \u201cAnd obviously, it\u2019ll be best if you can get something of Crabbe\u2019s and Goyle\u2019s; they\u2019re Malfoy\u2019s best friends, he\u2019ll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can\u2019t burst in on us while we\u2019re interrogating him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it all worked out,\u201d she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry\u2019s and Ron\u2019s stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. \u201cI\u2019ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they\u2019re bound to eat them. Once they\u2019re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.\n\n\u201cHermione, I don\u2019t think \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat could go seriously wrong \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.\n\n\u201cThe potion will be useless without Crabbe\u2019s and Goyle\u2019s hair,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cYou do want to investigate Malfoy, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all right, all right,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got mine!\u201d said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. \u201cRemember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she\u2019s gone home for Christmas \u2014 so I\u2019ll just have to tell the Slytherins I\u2019ve decided to come back.\u201d\n\nWhen Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?\u201d\n\nBut to Harry\u2019s and Ron\u2019s utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.\n\n\u201cHow thick can you get?\u201d Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.\n\nBy far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle\u2019s forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe\u2019s hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom.\n\nThey could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.\n\n\u201cHermione?\u201d\n\nThey heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat.\n\n\u201cDid you get them?\u201d Hermione asked breathlessly.\n\nHarry showed her Goyle\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cGood. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\u201d Hermione said, holding up a small sack. \u201cYou\u2019ll need bigger sizes once you\u2019re Crabbe and Goyle.\u201d\n\nThe three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve done everything right,\u201d said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \u201cIt looks like the book says it should . . . once we\u2019ve drunk it, we\u2019ll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow what?\u201d Ron whispered.\n\n\u201cWe separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\u201d\n\nHermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode\u2019s hair out of its bottle into the first glass.\n\nThe potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.\n\n\u201cUrgh \u2014 essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\u201d said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. \u201cBet it tastes disgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdd yours, then,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nHarry dropped Goyle\u2019s hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe\u2019s into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle\u2019s turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe\u2019s a dark, murky brown.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses. \u201cWe\u2019d better not all drink them in here. . . . Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won\u2019t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode\u2019s no pixie.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood thinking,\u201d said Ron, unlocking the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll take separate stalls.\u201d\n\nCareful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d he called.\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d came Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s voices.\n\n\u201cOne \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014\u201d\n\nPinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage.\n\nImmediately, his insides started writhing as though he\u2019d just swallowed live snakes \u2014 doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick \u2014 then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes \u2014 next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax \u2014 and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts \u2014 his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows \u2014 his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops \u2014 his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small \u2014\n\nAs suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle\u2019s boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn\u2019t need them \u2014 he took them off and called, \u201cAre you two okay?\u201d Goyle\u2019s low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.\n\nHarry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle.\n\nRon\u2019s door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.\n\n\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe\u2019s flat nose. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better get going,\u201d said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle\u2019s thick wrist. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got to find out where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find someone to follow . . .\u201d\n\nRon, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\u201d He banged on Hermione\u2019s door. \u201cC\u2019mon, we need to go \u2014\u201d\n\nA high-pitched voice answered him.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to come after all. You go on without me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode\u2019s ugly, no one\u2019s going to know it\u2019s you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 really \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll come. You two hurry up, you\u2019re wasting time \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry looked at Ron, bewildered.\n\n\u201cThat looks more like Goyle,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThat\u2019s how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, are you okay?\u201d said Harry through the door.\n\n\u201cFine \u2014 I\u2019m fine \u2014 go on \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you back here, all right?\u201d he said.\n\nHarry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t swing your arms like that,\u201d Harry muttered to Ron.\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\n\u201cCrabbe holds them sort of stiff. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s better. . . .\u201d\n\nThey went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around.\n\n\u201cAny ideas?\u201d muttered Harry.\n\n\u201cThe Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\u201d said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Ron, hurrying up to her. \u201cWe\u2019ve forgotten the way to our common room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d said the girl stiffly. \u201cOur common room? I\u2019m a Ravenclaw.\u201d\n\nShe walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.\n\nHarry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe\u2019s and Goyle\u2019s huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn\u2019t going to be as easy as they had hoped.\n\nThe labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Ron excitedly. \u201cThere\u2019s one of them now!\u201d\n\nThe figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn\u2019t a Slytherin, it was Percy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing down here?\u201d said Ron in surprise.\n\nPercy looked affronted.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said stiffly, \u201cis none of your business. It\u2019s Crabbe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWh \u2014 oh, yeah,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, get off to your dormitories,\u201d said Percy sternly. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d Ron pointed out.\n\n\u201cI,\u201d said Percy, drawing himself up, \u201cam a prefect. Nothing\u2019s about to attack me.\u201d\n\nA voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him.\n\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d he drawled, looking at them. \u201cHave you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I\u2019ve been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.\u201d\n\nMalfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019re you doing down here, Weasley?\u201d he sneered.\n\nPercy looked outraged.\n\n\u201cYou want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like your attitude!\u201d\n\nMalfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next passage, \u201cThat Peter Weasley \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPercy,\u201d Ron corrected him automatically.\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he\u2019s up to. He thinks he\u2019s going to catch Slytherin\u2019s heir single-handed.\u201d\n\nHe gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks.\n\nMalfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the new password again?\u201d he said to Harry.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah \u2014 pure-blood!\u201d said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron followed him.\n\nThe Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.\n\n\u201cWait here,\u201d said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire. \u201cI\u2019ll go and get it \u2014 my father\u2019s just sent it to me \u2014\u201d\n\nWondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at home.\n\nMalfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron\u2019s nose.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll give you a laugh,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry saw Ron\u2019s eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry.\n\nIt had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said:\n\n\n\nINQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\n\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.\n\nMr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr. Weasley\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cWeasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,\u201d Mr. Malfoy told our reporter. \u201cHe is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporters to clear off or she\u2019d set the family ghoul on them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cHa, ha,\u201d said Harry bleakly.\n\n\u201cArthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them,\u201d said Malfoy scornfully. \u201cYou\u2019d never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s \u2014 or rather, Crabbe\u2019s \u2014 face was contorted with fury.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, Crabbe?\u201d snapped Malfoy.\n\n\u201cStomachache,\u201d Ron grunted.\n\n\u201cWell, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me,\u201d said Malfoy, snickering. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m surprised the Daily Prophet hasn\u2019t reported all these attacks yet,\u201d he went on thoughtfully. \u201cI suppose Dumbledore\u2019s trying to hush it all up. He\u2019ll be sacked if it doesn\u2019t stop soon. Father\u2019s always said old Dumbledore\u2019s the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would never\u2019ve let slime like that Creevey in.\u201d\n\nMalfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: \u201c\u2018Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d\n\nFar too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.\n\n\u201cSaint Potter, the Mudbloods\u2019 friend,\u201d said Malfoy slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn\u2019t go around with that jumped-up Granger Mudblood. And people think he\u2019s Slytherin\u2019s heir!\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him \u2014 but then \u2014\n\n\u201cI wish I knew who it is,\u201d said Malfoy petulantly. \u201cI could help them.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn\u2019t notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, \u201cYou must have some idea who\u2019s behind it all. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I haven\u2019t, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?\u201d snapped Malfoy. \u201cAnd Father won\u2019t tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it\u2019ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing \u2014 last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it\u2019s a matter of time before one of them\u2019s killed this time. . . . I hope it\u2019s Granger,\u201d he said with relish.\n\nRon was clenching Crabbe\u2019s gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, \u201cD\u2019you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah . . . whoever it was was expelled,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cThey\u2019re probably still in Azkaban.\u201d\n\n\u201cAzkaban?\u201d said Harry, puzzled.\n\n\u201cAzkaban \u2014 the wizard prison, Goyle,\u201d said Malfoy, looking at him in disbelief. \u201cHonestly, if you were any slower, you\u2019d be going backward.\u201d\n\nHe shifted restlessly in his chair and said, \u201cFather says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. Of course, he\u2019s got a lot on his plate at the moment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?\u201d\n\nHarry tried to force Goyle\u2019s dull face into a look of concern.\n\n\u201cYeah . . .\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cLuckily, they didn\u2019t find much. Father\u2019s got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we\u2019ve got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHo!\u201d said Ron.\n\nMalfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was turning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening \u2014 their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.\n\nThey both jumped to their feet.\n\n\u201cMedicine for my stomach,\u201d Ron grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn\u2019t noticed anything. Harry could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle\u2019s huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they\u2019d locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom.\n\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t a complete waste of time,\u201d Ron panted, closing the bathroom door behind them. \u201cI know we still haven\u2019t found out who\u2019s doing the attacks, but I\u2019m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys\u2019 drawing room.\u201d\n\nHarry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal. He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione\u2019s stall.\n\n\u201cHermione, come out, we\u2019ve got loads to tell you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away!\u201d Hermione squeaked.\n\nHarry and Ron looked at each other.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou must be back to normal by now, we are \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had never seen her looking so happy.\n\n\u201cOoooooh, wait till you see,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s awful \u2014\u201d\n\nThey heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Ron uncertainly. \u201cHave you still got Millicent\u2019s nose or something?\u201d\n\nHermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.\n\nHer face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.\n\n\u201cIt was a c-cat hair!\u201d she howled. \u201cM-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn\u2019t supposed to be used for animal transformations!\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-oh,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be teased something dreadful,\u201d said Myrtle happily.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Hermione,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions. . . .\u201d\n\nIt took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. \u201cWait till everyone finds out you\u2019ve got a tail!\u201d"}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter13": "THE VERY SECRET DIARY\n\n\n\n\nHermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione\u2019s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face.\n\nHarry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term started, they brought her each day\u2019s homework.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d sprouted whiskers, I\u2019d take a break from work,\u201d said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione\u2019s bedside table one evening.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Ron, I\u2019ve got to keep up,\u201d said Hermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got any new leads?\u201d she added in a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn\u2019t hear her.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry gloomily.\n\n\u201cI was so sure it was Malfoy,\u201d said Ron, for about the hundredth time.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione\u2019s pillow.\n\n\u201cJust a get well card,\u201d said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud:\n\n\u201cTo Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly\u2019s Most-Charming-Smile Award.\u201d\n\nRon looked up at Hermione, disgusted.\n\n\u201cYou sleep with this under your pillow?\u201d\n\nBut Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine.\n\n\u201cIs Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you\u2019ve ever met, or what?\u201d Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much homework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a Hair-Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Filch,\u201d Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think someone else\u2019s been attacked?\u201d said Ron tensely.\n\nThey stood still, their heads inclined toward Filch\u2019s voice, which sounded quite hysterical.\n\n\u201c\u2014 even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven\u2019t got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I\u2019m going to Dumbledore \u2014\u201d\n\nHis footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam.\n\nThey poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle\u2019s wails echoing off the bathroom walls.\n\n\u201cNow what\u2019s up with her?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and see,\u201d said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.\n\nMoaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Myrtle?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d glugged Myrtle miserably. \u201cCome to throw something else at me?\u201d\n\nHarry waded across to her stall and said, \u201cWhy would I throw something at you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me,\u201d Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. \u201cHere I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it\u2019s funny to throw a book at me. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it can\u2019t hurt you if someone throws something at you,\u201d said Harry, reasonably. \u201cI mean, it\u2019d just go right through you, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHe had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, \u201cLet\u2019s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can\u2019t feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don\u2019t think!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho threw it at you, anyway?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. . . . I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,\u201d said Myrtle, glaring at them. \u201cIt\u2019s over there, it got washed out. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt could be dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cDangerous?\u201d said Harry, laughing. \u201cCome off it, how could it be dangerous?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book. \u201cSome of the books the Ministry\u2019s confiscated \u2014 Dad\u2019s told me \u2014 there was one that burned your eyes out. And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. And \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ve got the point,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.\n\n\u201cWell, we won\u2019t find out unless we look at it,\u201d he said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor.\n\nHarry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page he could just make out the name \u201cT. M. Riddle\u201d in smudged ink.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know that name. . . . T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow on earth d\u2019you know that?\u201d said Harry in amazement.\n\n\u201cBecause Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention,\u201d said Ron resentfully. \u201cThat was the one I burped slugs all over. If you\u2019d wiped slime off a name for an hour, you\u2019d remember it, too.\u201d\n\nHarry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There wasn\u2019t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel\u2019s birthday, or dentist, half-past three.\n\n\u201cHe never wrote in it,\u201d said Harry, disappointed.\n\n\u201cI wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\u201d said Ron curiously.\n\nHarry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve been Muggle-born,\u201d said Harry thoughtfully. \u201cTo have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not much use to you,\u201d said Ron. He dropped his voice. \u201cFifty points if you can get it through Myrtle\u2019s nose.\u201d\n\nHarry, however, pocketed it.\n\nHermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and fur-free, at the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle\u2019s diary and told her the story of how they had found it.\n\n\u201cOooh, it might have hidden powers,\u201d said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely.\n\n\u201cIf it has, it\u2019s hiding them very well,\u201d said Ron. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s shy. I don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t chuck it, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould\u2019ve been anything,\u201d said Ron. \u201cMaybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would\u2019ve done everyone a favor. . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione\u2019s face that she was thinking what he was thinking.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron, looking from one to the other.\n\n\u201cWell, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Malfoy said.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . .\u201d said Ron slowly.\n\n\u201cAnd this diary is fifty years old,\u201d said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Ron, wake up,\u201d snapped Hermione. \u201cWe know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything \u2014 where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it \u2014 the person who\u2019s behind the attacks this time wouldn\u2019t want that lying around, would they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a brilliant theory, Hermione,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwith just one tiny little flaw. There\u2019s nothing written in his diary.\u201d\n\nBut Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.\n\n\u201cIt might be invisible ink!\u201d she whispered.\n\nShe tapped the diary three times and said, \u201cAparecium!\u201d\n\nNothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\u201d she said.\n\nShe rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s nothing to find in there,\u201d said Ron. \u201cRiddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn\u2019t be bothered filling it in.\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t explain, even to himself, why he didn\u2019t just throw Riddle\u2019s diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though Riddle was a friend he\u2019d had when he was very small, and had half-forgotten. But this was absurd. He\u2019d never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.\n\nNevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle\u2019s special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he\u2019d seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime.\n\nRiddle\u2019s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It didn\u2019t carry details of why it had been given to him (\u201cGood thing, too, or it\u2019d be even bigger and I\u2019d still be polishing it,\u201d said Ron). However, they did find Riddle\u2019s name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys.\n\n\u201cHe sounds like Percy,\u201d said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \u201cPrefect, Head Boy . . . probably top of every class \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice.\n\nThe sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood.\n\n\u201cThe moment their acne clears up, they\u2019ll be ready for repotting again,\u201d Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \u201cAnd after that, it won\u2019t be long until we\u2019re cutting them up and stewing them. You\u2019ll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years. . . .\n\nErnie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn\u2019t take this cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \u201cgiven himself away\u201d at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn\u2019t helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \u201cOh, Potter, you rotter . . .\u201d now with a dance routine to match.\n\nGilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any more trouble, Minerva,\u201d he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. \u201cI think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him.\n\n\u201cYou know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won\u2019t say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing. . . .\u201d\n\nHe tapped his nose again and strode off.\n\nLockhart\u2019s idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn\u2019t had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he\u2019d walked through the wrong doors.\n\nThe walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon.\n\nRon pointed to the teachers\u2019 table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall\u2019s cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.\n\n\u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day!\u201d Lockhart shouted. \u201cAnd may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t end here!\u201d\n\nLockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.\n\n\u201cMy friendly, card-carrying cupids!\u201d beamed Lockhart. \u201cThey will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn\u2019t stop here! I\u2019m sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you\u2019re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I\u2019ve ever met, the sly old dog!\u201d\n\nProfessor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.\n\n\u201cPlease, Hermione, tell me you weren\u2019t one of the forty-six,\u201d said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn\u2019t answer.\n\nAll day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry.\n\n\u201cOi, you! \u2019Arry Potter!\u201d shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.\n\nHot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people\u2019s shins, and reached him before he\u2019d gone two paces.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a musical message to deliver to \u2019Arry Potter in person,\u201d he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.\n\n\u201cNot here,\u201d Harry hissed, trying to escape.\n\n\u201cStay still!\u201d grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry\u2019s bag and pulling him back.\n\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d Harry snarled, tugging.\n\nWith a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything.\n\nHarry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all this commotion?\u201d said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived.\n\nLosing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, sitting on Harry\u2019s ankles. \u201cHere is your singing valentine:\n\n\n\nHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,\n\nHis hair is as dark as a blackboard.\n\nI wish he was mine, he\u2019s really divine,\n\nThe hero who conquered the Dark Lord.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.\n\n\u201cOff you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\u201d he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \u201cAnd you, Malfoy \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he\u2019d got Riddle\u2019s diary.\n\n\u201cGive that back,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\n\u201cWonder what Potter\u2019s written in this?\u201d said Malfoy, who obviously hadn\u2019t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry\u2019s own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.\n\n\u201cHand it over, Malfoy,\u201d said Percy sternly.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve had a look,\u201d said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry.\n\nPercy said, \u201cAs a school prefect \u2014\u201d but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d and just as Snape had Disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d said Percy loudly. \u201cNo magic in the corridors. I\u2019ll have to report this, you know!\u201d\n\nBut Harry didn\u2019t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \u201cI don\u2019t think Potter liked your valentine much!\u201d\n\nGinny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn\u2019t need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until they had reached Professor Flitwick\u2019s class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle\u2019s diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn\u2019t much interested in anything else.\n\nHarry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn\u2019t think he could stand Fred and George singing, \u201cHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\u201d one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle\u2019s diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.\n\nHarry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.\n\nThe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \u201cMy name is Harry Potter.\u201d\n\nThe words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened.\n\nOozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written.\n\n\u201cHello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?\u201d\n\nThese words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back.\n\n\u201cSomeone tried to flush it down a toilet.\u201d\n\nHe waited eagerly for Riddle\u2019s reply.\n\n\u201cLucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.\n\n\u201cI mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I am now,\u201d Harry wrote quickly. \u201cI\u2019m at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff\u2019s been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\u201d\n\nHis heart was hammering. Riddle\u2019s reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\n\n\u201cOf course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person who\u2019d opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned.\u201d\n\nHarry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who\u2019s behind them. Who was it last time?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can show you, if you like,\u201d came Riddle\u2019s reply. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him.\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else\u2019s memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.\n\n\u201cLet me show you.\u201d\n\nHarry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.\n\n\u201cOK.\u201d\n\nThe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a minuscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.\n\nHe felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.\n\nHe knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore\u2019s office \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said shakily. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to butt in \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the wizard didn\u2019t look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \u201cEr \u2014 I\u2019ll just go, shall I?\u201d\n\nStill the wizard ignored him. He didn\u2019t seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.\n\n\u201cSorry I disturbed you. I\u2019ll go now,\u201d he half-shouted.\n\nThe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.\n\nThe sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.\n\nHarry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix \u2014 no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.\n\nThere was a knock on the office door.\n\n\u201cEnter,\u201d said the old wizard in a feeble voice.\n\nA boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect\u2019s badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.\n\n\u201cAh, Riddle,\u201d said the headmaster.\n\n\u201cYou wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\u201d said Riddle. He looked nervous.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said Dippet. \u201cI\u2019ve just been reading the letter you sent me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy,\u201d said Dippet kindly, \u201cI cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Riddle at once. \u201cI\u2019d much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that \u2014 to that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\u201d said Dippet curiously.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Riddle, reddening slightly.\n\n\u201cYou are Muggle-born?\u201d\n\n\u201cHalf-blood, sir,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cMuggle father, witch mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd are both your parents \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me \u2014 Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\u201d\n\nDippet clucked his tongue sympathetically.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, Tom,\u201d he sighed, \u201cspecial arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean all these attacks, sir?\u201d said Riddle, and Harry\u2019s heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d said the headmaster. \u201cMy dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy . . . the death of that poor little girl. . . . You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the \u2014 er \u2014 source of all this unpleasantness. . . .\u201d\n\nRiddle\u2019s eyes had widened.\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 if the person was caught \u2014 if it all stopped \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \u201cRiddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Riddle quickly.\n\nBut Harry was sure it was the same sort of \u201cno\u201d that he himself had given Dumbledore.\n\nDippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.\n\n\u201cYou may go, Tom. . . .\u201d\n\nRiddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him.\n\nDown the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\n\nThen, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn\u2019t see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?\u201d\n\nHarry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-years-younger Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI had to see the headmaster, sir,\u201d said Riddle.\n\n\u201cWell, hurry off to bed,\u201d said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \u201cBest not to roam the corridors these days. Not since . . .\u201d\n\nHe sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.\n\nBut to Harry\u2019s disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn\u2019t been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.\n\nIt felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door.\n\nSomeone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn\u2019t be heard.\n\nFor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon . . . gotta get yeh outta here. . . . C\u2019mon now . . . in the box . . .\u201d\n\nThere was something familiar about that voice. . . .\n\nRiddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.\n\n\u201cEvening, Rubeus,\u201d said Riddle sharply.\n\nThe boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\n\n\u201cWhat yer doin\u2019 down here, Tom?\u201d\n\nRiddle stepped closer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They\u2019re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019yeh \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don\u2019t make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never killed no one!\u201d said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rubeus,\u201d said Riddle, moving yet closer. \u201cThe dead girl\u2019s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him!\u201d roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019! He never!\u201d\n\n\u201cStand aside,\u201d said Riddle, drawing out his wand.\n\nHis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone \u2014\n\nA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers \u2014 Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, \u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d\n\nThe scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle\u2019s diary lying open on his stomach.\n\nBefore he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in.\n\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Ron, looking at him with concern.\n\n\u201cIt was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.\u201d"}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter14": "CORNELIUS FUDGE\n\n\n\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he\u2019d christened \u201cFluffy.\u201d And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he\u2019d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He\u2019d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody.\n\nHarry half wished he hadn\u2019t found out how to work Riddle\u2019s diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he\u2019d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.\n\n\u201cRiddle might have got the wrong person,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cMaybe it was some other monster that was attacking people. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many monsters d\u2019you think this place can hold?\u201d Ron asked dully.\n\n\u201cWe always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\u201d said Harry miserably. \u201cAnd the attacks must\u2019ve stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn\u2019t have got his award.\u201d\n\nRon tried a different tack.\n\n\u201cRiddle does sound like Percy \u2014 who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the monster had killed someone, Ron,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cAnd Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him for wanting to stay here. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\nThe three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\n\n\u201cDo you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be a cheerful visit,\u201d said Ron. \u201c\u2018Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his \u201cOh, Potter, you rotter\u201d song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy.\n\n\u201cThe moment they start trying to move into each other\u2019s pots, we\u2019ll know they\u2019re fully mature,\u201d she told Harry. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.\u201d\n\nThe second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.\n\n\u201cIt could affect our whole future,\u201d she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.\n\n\u201cI just want to give up Potions,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d said Ron gloomily. \u201cWe keep all our old subjects, or I\u2019d\u2019ve ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s very important!\u201d said Hermione, shocked.\n\n\u201cNot the way Lockhart teaches it,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI haven\u2019t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.\u201d\n\nNeville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than Study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody\u2019s advice but signed up for everything.\n\nHarry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn\u2019t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience.\n\n\u201cDepends where you want to go, Harry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never too early to think about the future, so I\u2019d recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they\u2019re thinking of working in close contact with them \u2014 look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.\u201d\n\nBut the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he\u2019d have someone friendly to help him.\n\nGryffindor\u2019s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday\u2019s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor\u2019s chances for the Quidditch Cup had never been better.\n\nBut his cheerful mood didn\u2019t last long. At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 I don\u2019t know who did it \u2014 I just found \u2014\u201d\n\nWatching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.\n\nThe contents of Harry\u2019s trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.\n\nHarry walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly.\n\n\u201cWhat happened, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry\u2019s robes. All the pockets were hanging out.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s been looking for something,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIs there anything missing?\u201d\n\nHarry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cRiddle\u2019s diary\u2019s gone,\u201d he said in an undertone to Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHarry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.\n\nHermione looked aghast at the news.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 only a Gryffindor could have stolen \u2014 nobody else knows our password \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze.\n\n\u201cPerfect Quidditch conditions!\u201d said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team\u2019s plates with scrambled eggs. \u201cHarry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.\u201d\n\nHarry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle\u2019s diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn\u2019t like the idea. He\u2019d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He didn\u2019t want to be the one who brought it all up again.\n\nAs he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry\u2019s growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again \u2014\n\n\u201cKill this time . . . let me rip . . . tear . . .\u201d\n\nHe shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm.\n\n\u201cThe voice!\u201d said Harry, looking over his shoulder. \u201cI just heard it again \u2014 didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nRon shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 I think I\u2019ve just understood something! I\u2019ve got to go to the library!\u201d\n\nAnd she sprinted away, up the stairs.\n\n\u201cWhat does she understand?\u201d said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from.\n\n\u201cLoads more than I do,\u201d said Ron, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cBut why\u2019s she got to go to the library?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s what Hermione does,\u201d said Ron, shrugging. \u201cWhen in doubt, go to the library.\u201d\n\nHarry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get moving,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly eleven \u2014 the match \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.\n\nThe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goalposts; Madam Hooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.\n\nHarry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.\n\nHarry\u2019s heart dropped like a stone.\n\n\u201cThis match has been canceled,\u201d Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick.\n\n\u201cBut, Professor!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play \u2014 the Cup \u2014 Gryffindor \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone:\n\n\u201cAll students are to make their way back to the House common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information. As quickly as you can, please!\u201d\n\nThen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.\n\n\u201cPotter, I think you\u2019d better come with me. . . .\u201d\n\nWondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry\u2019s surprise, Professor McGonagall didn\u2019t object.\n\n\u201cYes, perhaps you\u2019d better come, too, Weasley. . . .\u201d\n\nSome of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. But they weren\u2019t taken to anybody\u2019s office this time.\n\n\u201cThis will be a bit of a shock,\u201d said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. \u201cThere has been another attack . . . another double attack.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered.\n\nMadam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth-year girl with long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they\u2019d accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to her was \u2014\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d Ron groaned.\n\nHermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.\n\n\u201cThey were found near the library,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to them. . . .\u201d\n\nShe was holding up a small, circular mirror.\n\nHarry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.\n\n\u201cI will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,\u201d said Professor McGonagall heavily. \u201cI need to address the students in any case.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll students will return to their House common rooms by six o\u2019clock in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.\u201d\n\nThe Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, \u201cI need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.\u201d\n\nShe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,\u201d said the Weasley twins\u2019 friend Lee Jordan, counting on his fingers. \u201cHaven\u2019t any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn\u2019t it obvious all this stuff\u2019s coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin \u2014 why don\u2019t they just chuck all the Slytherins out?\u201d he roared, to nods and scattered applause.\n\nPercy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn\u2019t seem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.\n\n\u201cPercy\u2019s in shock,\u201d George told Harry quietly. \u201cThat Ravenclaw girl \u2014 Penelope Clearwater \u2014 she\u2019s a prefect. I don\u2019t think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.\u201d\n\nBut Harry was only half-listening. He didn\u2019t seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if the culprit wasn\u2019t caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we going to do?\u201d said Ron quietly in Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cD\u2019you think they suspect Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and talk to him,\u201d said Harry, making up his mind. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he\u2019ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that\u2019s a start.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut McGonagall said we\u2019ve got to stay in our tower unless we\u2019re in class \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said Harry, more quietly still, \u201cit\u2019s time to get my dad\u2019s old Cloak out again.\u201d\n\nHarry had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the Cloak over themselves.\n\nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn\u2019t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn\u2019t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open.\n\nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid\u2019s house and pulled off the Cloak only when they were right outside his front door.\n\nSeconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. \u201cWhat\u2019re you two doin\u2019 here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside.\n\n\u201cNothin\u2019 \u2014 nothin\u2019 \u2014\u201d Hagrid muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve bin expectin\u2019 \u2014 doesn\u2019 matter \u2014 Sit down \u2014 I\u2019ll make tea \u2014\u201d\n\nHe hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.\n\n\u201cAre you okay, Hagrid?\u201d said Harry. \u201cDid you hear about Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I heard, all righ\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.\n\nHe kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door.\n\nHagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more.\n\n\u201cGood evening, Hagrid.\u201d\n\nIt was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man.\n\nThe stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Dad\u2019s boss!\u201d Ron breathed. \u201cCornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!\u201d\n\nHarry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.\n\nHagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.\n\n\u201cBad business, Hagrid,\u201d said Fudge in rather clipped tones. \u201cVery bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things\u2019ve gone far enough. Ministry\u2019s got to act.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never,\u201d said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \u201cYou know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\u201d said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.\n\n\u201cLook, Albus,\u201d said Fudge, uncomfortably. \u201cHagrid\u2019s record\u2019s against him. Ministry\u2019s got to do something \u2014 the school governors have been in touch \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,\u201d said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before.\n\n\u201cLook at it from my point of view,\u201d said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. \u201cI\u2019m under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it wasn\u2019t Hagrid, he\u2019ll be back and no more said. But I\u2019ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn\u2019t be doing my duty \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTake me?\u201d said Hagrid, who was trembling. \u201cTake me where?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a short stretch only,\u201d said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid\u2019s eyes. \u201cNot a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you\u2019ll be let out with a full apology \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Azkaban?\u201d croaked Hagrid.\n\nBefore Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.\n\nDumbledore answered it. It was Harry\u2019s turn for an elbow in the ribs; he\u2019d let out an audible gasp.\n\nMr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid\u2019s hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl.\n\n\u201cAlready here, Fudge,\u201d he said approvingly. \u201cGood, good . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d said Hagrid furiously. \u201cGet outta my house!\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your \u2014 er \u2014 d\u2019you call this a house?\u201d said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. \u201cI simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?\u201d said Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.\n\n\u201cDreadful thing, Dumbledore,\u201d said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, \u201cbut the governors feel it\u2019s time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension \u2014 you\u2019ll find all twelve signatures on it. I\u2019m afraid we feel you\u2019re losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn\u2019t it? At this rate, there\u2019ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, now, see here, Lucius,\u201d said Fudge, looking alarmed, \u201cDumbledore suspended \u2014 no, no \u2014 last thing we want just now \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe appointment \u2014 or suspension \u2014 of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \u201cAnd as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSee here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can\u2019t stop them,\u201d said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, \u201cI mean to say, who can?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \u201cBut as all twelve of us have voted \u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 how many did yeh have ter threaten an\u2019 blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?\u201d he roared.\n\n\u201cDear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy. \u201cI would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won\u2019t like it at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh can\u2019 take Dumbledore!\u201d yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \u201cTake him away, an\u2019 the Muggle-borns won\u2019 stand a chance! There\u2019ll be killin\u2019 next!\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm yourself, Hagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy.\n\n\u201cIf the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d stuttered Fudge.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d growled Hagrid.\n\nDumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy\u2019s cold gray ones.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \u201cyou will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\u201d\n\nFor a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore\u2019s eyes flickered toward the corner where he and Ron stood hidden.\n\n\u201cAdmirable sentiments,\u201d said Malfoy, bowing. \u201cWe shall all miss your \u2014 er \u2014 highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope that your successor will manage to prevent any \u2014 ah \u2014 killins.\u201d\n\nHe strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for Hagrid to go ahead of him, but Hagrid stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, \u201cIf anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they\u2019d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders. That\u2019d lead \u2019em right! That\u2019s all I\u2019m sayin\u2019.\u201d\n\nFudge stared at him in amazement.\n\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019m comin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin overcoat. But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he stopped again and said loudly, \u201cAn\u2019 someone\u2019ll need ter feed Fang while I\u2019m away.\u201d\n\nThe door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in trouble now,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cNo Dumbledore. They might as well close the school tonight. There\u2019ll be an attack a day with him gone.\u201d\n\nFang started howling, scratching at the closed door."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter15": "ARAGOG\n\n\n\n\nSummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn\u2019t look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.\n\nHarry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking no more chances,\u201d Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off. . . .\u201d\n\nWith Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn\u2019t look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.\n\nHarry constantly repeated Dumbledore\u2019s final words to himself. \u201cI will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. . . . Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\u201d But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?\n\nHagrid\u2019s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand \u2014 the trouble was, there didn\u2019t seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren\u2019t allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.\n\nOne person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn\u2019t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cI always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,\u201d he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \u201cI told you he thinks Dumbledore\u2019s the worst headmaster the school\u2019s ever had. Maybe we\u2019ll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won\u2019t want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won\u2019t last long, she\u2019s only filling in. . . .\u201d\n\nSnape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione\u2019s empty seat and cauldron.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d said Malfoy loudly. \u201cSir, why don\u2019t you apply for the headmaster\u2019s job?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, now, Malfoy,\u201d said Snape, though he couldn\u2019t suppress a thin-lipped smile. \u201cProfessor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he\u2019ll be back with us soon enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d said Malfoy, smirking. \u201cI expect you\u2019d have Father\u2019s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job \u2014 I\u2019ll tell Father you\u2019re the best teacher here, sir \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven\u2019t all packed their bags by now,\u201d Malfoy went on. \u201cBet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn\u2019t Granger \u2014\u201d\n\nThe bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy\u2019s last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.\n\n\u201cLet me at him,\u201d Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t need my wand, I\u2019m going to kill him with my bare hands \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHurry up, I\u2019ve got to take you all to Herbology,\u201d barked Snape over the class\u2019s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.\n\nThe Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione.\n\nProfessor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \u201cI just want to say, Harry, that I\u2019m sorry I ever suspected you. I know you\u2019d never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We\u2019re all in the same boat now, and, well \u2014\u201d\n\nHe held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.\n\nErnie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cThat Draco Malfoy character,\u201d said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, \u201che seems very pleased about all this, doesn\u2019t he? D\u2019you know, I think he might be Slytherin\u2019s heir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s clever of you,\u201d said Ron, who didn\u2019t seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s Malfoy, Harry?\u201d Ernie asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.\n\nA second later, Harry spotted something.\n\nSeveral large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears.\n\n\u201cOuch! What\u2019re you \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \u201cBut we can\u2019t follow them now \u2014\u201d\n\nErnie and Hannah were listening curiously.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up.\n\n\u201cLooks like they\u2019re heading for the Forbidden Forest. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd Ron looked even unhappier about that.\n\nAt the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\u201d Harry told Ron. \u201cWe can take Fang with us. He\u2019s used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. \u201cEr \u2014 aren\u2019t there \u2014 aren\u2019t there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?\u201d he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart\u2019s classroom.\n\nPreferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \u201cThere are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns . . .\u201d\n\nRon had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.\n\nLockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.\n\n\u201cCome now,\u201d he cried, beaming around him. \u201cWhy all these long faces?\u201d\n\nPeople swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you people realize,\u201d said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, \u201cthe danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSays who?\u201d said Dean Thomas loudly.\n\n\u201cMy dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn\u2019t have taken Hagrid if he hadn\u2019t been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\u201d said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two.\n\n\u201cOh, yes he would,\u201d said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.\n\n\u201cI flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid\u2019s arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,\u201d said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.\n\nRon started to say that he didn\u2019t think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t there, remember?\u201d Harry muttered.\n\nBut Lockhart\u2019s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart\u2019s stupid face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let\u2019s do it tonight.\n\nRon read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.\n\nThe Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o\u2019clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn\u2019t empty until past midnight.\n\nHarry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione\u2019s usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.\n\nHarry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the Cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole.\n\nIt was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \u201cwe might get to the forest and find there\u2019s nothing to follow. Those spiders might not\u2019ve been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but . . .\u201d\n\nHis voice trailed away hopefully.\n\nThey reached Hagrid\u2019s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.\n\nHarry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid\u2019s table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Fang, we\u2019re going for a walk,\u201d said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.\n\nHarry took out his wand, murmured, \u201cLumos!\u201d and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.\n\n\u201cGood thinking,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019d light mine, too, but you know \u2014 it\u2019d probably blow up or something. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \u201cI\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nSo, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry\u2019s wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry\u2019s wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.\n\nHarry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he\u2019d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.\n\nSomething wet touched Harry\u2019s hand and he jumped backward, crushing Ron\u2019s foot, but it was only Fang\u2019s nose.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon?\u201d Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come this far,\u201d said Ron.\n\nSo they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn\u2019t move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang\u2019s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.\n\nThey walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.\n\nThen Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry\u2019s elbow very hard.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something moving over there,\u201d Harry breathed. \u201cListen . . . sounds like something big. . . .\u201d\n\nThey listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Ron. \u201cOh, no, oh, no, oh \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Harry frantically. \u201cIt\u2019ll hear you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHear me?\u201d said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \u201cIt\u2019s already heard Fang!\u201d\n\nThe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think it\u2019s doing?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cProbably getting ready to pounce,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThey waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think it\u2019s gone?\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cDunno \u2014\u201d\n\nThen, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief. \u201cHarry, it\u2019s our car!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d\n\nHarry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.\n\nMr. Weasley\u2019s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, openmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been here all the time!\u201d said Ron delightedly, walking around the car. \u201cLook at it. The forest\u2019s turned it wild. . . .\u201d\n\nThe sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn\u2019t seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes.\n\n\u201cAnd we thought it was going to attack us!\u201d said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it. \u201cI wondered where it had gone!\u201d\n\nHarry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the trail,\u201d he said. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go and find them.\u201d\n\nRon didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t move. His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was livid with terror.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron\u2019s legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling \u2014 next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.\n\nHead hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn\u2019t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.\n\nHe never knew how long he was in the creature\u2019s clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.\n\nSpiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.\n\nHarry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn\u2019t howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.\n\nHarry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke.\n\n\u201cAragog!\u201d it called. \u201cAragog!\u201d\n\nAnd from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was blind.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.\n\n\u201cMen,\u201d clicked the spider who had caught Harry.\n\n\u201cIs it Hagrid?\u201d said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely.\n\n\u201cStrangers,\u201d clicked the spider who had brought Ron.\n\n\u201cKill them,\u201d clicked Aragog fretfully. \u201cI was sleeping. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re friends of Hagrid\u2019s,\u201d Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat.\n\nClick, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.\n\nAragog paused.\n\n\u201cHagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,\u201d he said slowly.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s in trouble,\u201d said Harry, breathing very fast. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn trouble?\u201d said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. \u201cBut why has he sent you?\u201d\n\nHarry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn\u2019t think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could.\n\n\u201cThey think, up at the school, that Hagrid\u2019s been setting a \u2014 a \u2014 something on students. They\u2019ve taken him to Azkaban.\u201d\n\nAragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn\u2019t usually make Harry feel sick with fear.\n\n\u201cBut that was years ago,\u201d said Aragog fretfully. \u201cYears and years ago. I remember it well. That\u2019s why they made him leave the school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you . . . you didn\u2019t come from the Chamber of Secrets?\u201d said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.\n\n\u201cI!\u201d said Aragog, clicking angrily. \u201cI was not born in the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid\u2019s goodness. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry summoned what remained of his courage.\n\n\u201cSo you never \u2014 never attacked anyone?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d croaked the old spider. \u201cIt would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then . . . Do you know what did kill that girl?\u201d said Harry. \u201cBecause whatever it is, it\u2019s back and attacking people again \u2014\u201d\n\nHis words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him.\n\n\u201cThe thing that lives in the castle,\u201d said Aragog, \u201cis an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said Harry urgently.\n\nMore loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.\n\n\u201cWe do not speak of it!\u201d said Aragog fiercely. \u201cWe do not name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just go, then,\u201d Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him.\n\n\u201cGo?\u201d said Aragog slowly. \u201cI think not. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.\u201d\n\nHarry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.\n\nEven as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow.\n\nMr. Weasley\u2019s car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.\n\n\u201cGet Fang!\u201d Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car \u2014 the doors slammed shut \u2014 Ron didn\u2019t touch the accelerator but the car didn\u2019t need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.\n\nHarry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren\u2019t popping anymore.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\nRon stared straight ahead, unable to speak.\n\nThey smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.\n\nThe car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid\u2019s house, tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view.\n\nHarry went back into Hagrid\u2019s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch.\n\n\u201cFollow the spiders,\u201d said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive Hagrid. We\u2019re lucky to be alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet he thought Aragog wouldn\u2019t hurt friends of his,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly Hagrid\u2019s problem!\u201d said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin. \u201cHe always thinks monsters aren\u2019t as bad as they\u2019re made out, and look where it\u2019s got him! A cell in Azkaban!\u201d He was shivering uncontrollably now. \u201cWhat was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out, I\u2019d like to know?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\u201d said Harry, throwing the Cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk. \u201cHe was innocent.\u201d\n\nRon gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn\u2019t his idea of being innocent.\n\nAs the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the Cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the Cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.\n\nRon fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn\u2019t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his four-poster, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.\n\nThe creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort \u2014 even other monsters didn\u2019t want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nHarry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.\n\nHe was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.\n\n\u201cRon,\u201d he hissed through the dark, \u201cRon \u2014\u201d\n\nRon woke with a yelp like Fang\u2019s, stared wildly around, and saw Harry.\n\n\u201cRon \u2014 that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\u201d said Harry, ignoring Neville\u2019s snuffling snores from the corner. \u201cWhat if she never left the bathroom? What if she\u2019s still there?\u201d\n\nRon rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he understood, too.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think \u2014 not Moaning Myrtle?\u201d"}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter16": "THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS\n\n\n\n\nAll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just three toilets away,\u201d said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day, \u201cand we could\u2019ve asked her, and now . . .\u201d\n\nIt had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls\u2019 bathroom, the girls\u2019 bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible.\n\nBut something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today.\n\n\u201cExams?\u201d howled Seamus Finnigan. \u201cWe\u2019re still getting exams?\u201d\n\nThere was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom\u2019s wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professor McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cThe exams will therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\u201d\n\nStudying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore\u2019s instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn\u2019t seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam.\n\nRon looked as though he\u2019d just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine me taking exams with this?\u201d he asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly.\n\nThree days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast.\n\n\u201cI have good news,\u201d she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted.\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s coming back!\u201d several people yelled joyfully.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!\u201d squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table.\n\n\u201cQuidditch matches are back on!\u201d roared Wood excitedly.\n\nWhen the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, \u201cProfessor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.\u201d\n\nThere was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn\u2019t at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn\u2019t joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he\u2019d looked in days.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\u201d he said to Harry. \u201cHermione\u2019ll probably have all the answers when they wake her up! Mind you, she\u2019ll go crazy when she finds out we\u2019ve got exams in three days\u2019 time. She hasn\u2019t studied. It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they\u2019re over.\u201d\n\nJust then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Ron, helping himself to more porridge.\n\nGinny didn\u2019t say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn\u2019t think who.\n\n\u201cSpit it out,\u201d said Ron, watching her.\n\nHarry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you something,\u201d Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said Harry.\n\nGinny looked as though she couldn\u2019t find the right words.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron.\n\nGinny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him.\n\n\u201cIs it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting oddly?\u201d\n\nGinny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve finished eating, I\u2019ll take that seat, Ginny. I\u2019m starving, I\u2019ve only just come off patrol duty.\u201d\n\nGinny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table.\n\n\u201cPercy!\u201d said Ron angrily. \u201cShe was just about to tell us something important!\u201d\n\nHalfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of thing?\u201d he said, coughing.\n\n\u201cI just asked her if she\u2019d seen anything odd, and she started to say \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 that \u2014 that\u2019s nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\u201d said Percy at once.\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d said Ron, his eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cWell, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day when I was \u2014 well, never mind \u2014 the point is, she spotted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody. I must say, I did think she\u2019d keep her word. It\u2019s nothing, really, I\u2019d just rather \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing, Percy?\u201d said Ron, grinning. \u201cGo on, tell us, we won\u2019t laugh.\u201d\n\nPercy didn\u2019t smile back.\n\n\u201cPass me those rolls, Harry, I\u2019m starving.\u201d\n\nHarry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but he wasn\u2019t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up \u2014 and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart.\n\nLockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed, only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors. His hair wasn\u2019t as sleek as usual; it seemed he had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor.\n\n\u201cMark my words,\u201d he said, ushering them around a corner. \u201cThe first words out of those poor Petrified people\u2019s mouths will be \u2018It was Hagrid.\u2019 Frankly, I\u2019m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree, sir,\u201d said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise.\n\n\u201cThank you, Harry,\u201d said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \u201cI mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Ron, catching on. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave us here, sir, we\u2019ve only got one more corridor to go \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, Weasley, I think I will,\u201d said Lockhart. \u201cI really should go and prepare my next class \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd he hurried off.\n\n\u201cPrepare his class,\u201d Ron sneered after him. \u201cGone to curl his hair, more like.\u201d\n\nThey let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme \u2014\n\n\u201cPotter! Weasley! What are you doing?\u201d\n\nIt was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines.\n\n\u201cWe were \u2014 we were \u2014\u201d Ron stammered. \u201cWe were going to \u2014 to go and see \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen her for ages, Professor,\u201d Harry went on hurriedly, treading on Ron\u2019s foot, \u201cand we thought we\u2019d sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment, Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye. \u201cOf course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been . . . I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns where you\u2019ve gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they\u2019d avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall blow her nose.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Ron fervently, \u201cwas the best story you\u2019ve ever come up with.\u201d\n\nThey had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall\u2019s permission to visit Hermione.\n\nMadam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no point talking to a Petrified person,\u201d she said, and they had to admit she had a point when they\u2019d taken their seats next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn\u2019t have the faintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.\n\n\u201cWonder if she did see the attacker, though?\u201d said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione\u2019s rigid face. \u201cBecause if he sneaked up on them all, no one\u2019ll ever know. . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry wasn\u2019t looking at Hermione\u2019s face. He was more interested in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist.\n\nMaking sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron.\n\n\u201cTry and get it out,\u201d Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey\u2019s view.\n\nIt was no easy task. Hermione\u2019s hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free.\n\nIt was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.\n\n\n\nOf the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken\u2019s egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione\u2019s. Pipes.\n\nIt was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.\n\n\u201cRon,\u201d he breathed. \u201cThis is it. This is the answer. The monster in the Chamber\u2019s a basilisk \u2014 a giant serpent! That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It\u2019s because I understand Parseltongue. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at the beds around him.\n\n\u201cThe basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one\u2019s died \u2014 because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin . . . Justin must\u2019ve seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn\u2019t die again . . . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her mirror \u2014 and \u2014\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s jaw had dropped.\n\n\u201cAnd Mrs. Norris?\u201d he whispered eagerly.\n\nHarry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.\n\n\u201cThe water . . .\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThe flood from Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection. . . .\u201d\n\nHe scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it, the more it made sense.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it\u2019!\u201d he read aloud. \u201cHagrid\u2019s roosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn\u2019t want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! \u2018Spiders flee before the Basilisk\u2019! It all fits!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how\u2019s the basilisk been getting around the place?\u201d said Ron. \u201cA giant snake . . . Someone would\u2019ve seen . . .\u201d\n\nHarry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page.\n\n\u201cPipes,\u201d he said. \u201cPipes . . . Ron, it\u2019s been using the plumbing. I\u2019ve been hearing that voice inside the walls. . . .\u201d\n\nRon suddenly grabbed Harry\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cThe entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a bathroom? What if it\u2019s in \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThey sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able to believe it.\n\n\u201cThis means,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI can\u2019t be the only Parselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin\u2019s one, too. That\u2019s how he\u2019s been controlling the basilisk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we going to do?\u201d said Ron, whose eyes were flashing. \u201cShould we go straight to McGonagall?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the staffroom,\u201d said Harry, jumping up. \u201cShe\u2019ll be there in ten minutes. It\u2019s nearly break.\u201d\n\nThey ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted staffroom. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Harry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down.\n\nBut the bell to signal break never came.\n\nInstead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGonagall\u2019s voice, magically magnified.\n\n\u201cAll students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teachers return to the staffroom. Immediately, please.\u201d\n\nHarry wheeled around to stare at Ron.\n\n\u201cNot another attack? Not now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll we do?\u201d said Ron, aghast. \u201cGo back to the dormitory?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers\u2019 cloaks. \u201cIn here. Let\u2019s hear what it\u2019s all about. Then we can tell them what we\u2019ve found out.\u201d\n\nThey hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staffroom door banging open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.\n\n\u201cIt has happened,\u201d she told the silent staffroom. \u201cA student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.\u201d\n\nProfessor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Heir of Slytherin,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, \u201cleft another message. Right underneath the first one. \u2018Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.\u2019\u201d\n\nProfessor Flitwick burst into tears.\n\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a chair. \u201cWhich student?\u201d\n\n\u201cGinny Weasley,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\nHarry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside him.\n\n\u201cWe shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cThis is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said . . .\u201d\n\nThe staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and he was beaming.\n\n\u201cSo sorry \u2014 dozed off \u2014 what have I missed?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him with something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward.\n\n\u201cJust the man,\u201d he said. \u201cThe very man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come at last.\u201d\n\nLockhart blanched.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Gilderoy,\u201d chipped in Professor Sprout. \u201cWeren\u2019t you saying just last night that you\u2019ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 well, I \u2014\u201d sputtered Lockhart.\n\n\u201cYes, didn\u2019t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?\u201d piped up Professor Flitwick.\n\n\u201cD-did I? I don\u2019t recall \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn\u2019t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,\u201d said Snape. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?\u201d\n\nLockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I really never \u2014 you may have misunderstood \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cTonight will be an excellent time to do it. We\u2019ll make sure everyone\u2019s out of your way. You\u2019ll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. A free rein at last.\u201d\n\nLockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the rescue. He didn\u2019t look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and feeble.\n\n\u201cV-very well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll \u2014 I\u2019ll be in my office, getting \u2014 getting ready.\u201d\n\nAnd he left the room.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared, \u201cthat\u2019s got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should go and inform their students what has happened. Tell them the Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories.\u201d\n\nThe teachers rose and left, one by one.\n\nIt was probably the worst day of Harry\u2019s entire life. He, Ron, Fred, and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room, unable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn\u2019t there. He had gone to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his dormitory.\n\nNo afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.\n\n\u201cShe knew something, Harry,\u201d said Ron, speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staffroom. \u201cThat\u2019s why she was taken. It wasn\u2019t some stupid thing about Percy at all. She\u2019d found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why she was \u2014\u201d Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. \u201cI mean, she was a pureblood. There can\u2019t be any other reason.\u201d\n\nHarry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do. Anything.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cD\u2019you think there\u2019s any chance at all she\u2019s not \u2014 you know \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say. He couldn\u2019t see how Ginny could still be alive.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you know what?\u201d said Ron. \u201cI think we should go and see Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He\u2019s going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it\u2019s a basilisk in there.\u201d\n\nBecause Harry couldn\u2019t think of anything else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole.\n\nDarkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart\u2019s office. There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps.\n\nHarry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart\u2019s eyes peering through it.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 Mr. Potter \u2014 Mr. Weasley \u2014\u201d he said, opening the door a bit wider. \u201cI\u2019m rather busy at the moment \u2014 if you would be quick \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor, we\u2019ve got some information for you,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe think it\u2019ll help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 well \u2014 it\u2019s not terribly \u2014\u201d The side of Lockhart\u2019s face that they could see looked very uncomfortable. \u201cI mean \u2014 well \u2014 all right \u2014\u201d\n\nHe opened the door and they entered.\n\nHis office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnight-blue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into the other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk.\n\n\u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cEr, well, yes,\u201d said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. \u201cUrgent call \u2014 unavoidable \u2014 got to go \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about my sister?\u201d said Ron jerkily.\n\n\u201cWell, as to that \u2014 most unfortunate \u2014\u201d said Lockhart, avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents into a bag. \u201cNo one regrets more than I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou can\u2019t go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 I must say \u2014 when I took the job \u2014\u201d Lockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of his robes. \u201cnothing in the job description \u2014 didn\u2019t expect \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re running away?\u201d said Harry disbelievingly. \u201cAfter all that stuff you did in your books \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBooks can be misleading,\u201d said Lockhart delicately.\n\n\u201cYou wrote them!\u201d Harry shouted.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy,\u201d said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry. \u201cDo use your common sense. My books wouldn\u2019t have sold half as well if people didn\u2019t think I\u2019d done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He\u2019d look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a hairy chin. I mean, come on \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve just been taking credit for what a load of other people have done?\u201d said Harry incredulously.\n\n\u201cHarry, Harry,\u201d said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, \u201cit\u2019s not nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they wouldn\u2019t remember doing it. If there\u2019s one thing I pride myself on, it\u2019s my Memory Charms. No, it\u2019s been a lot of work, Harry. It\u2019s not all book signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard slog.\u201d\n\nHe banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s everything. Yes. Only one thing left.\u201d\n\nHe pulled out his wand and turned to them.\n\n\u201cAwfully sorry, boys, but I\u2019ll have to put a Memory Charm on you now. Can\u2019t have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. I\u2019d never sell another book \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d\n\nLockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,\u201d said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart\u2019s trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at him, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you want me to do?\u201d said Lockhart weakly. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in luck,\u201d said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint. \u201cWe think we know where it is. And what\u2019s inside it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThey marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom.\n\nThey sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was shaking.\n\nMoaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d she said when she saw Harry. \u201cWhat do you want this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo ask you how you died,\u201d said Harry.\n\nMyrtle\u2019s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question.\n\n\u201cOoooh, it was dreadful,\u201d she said with relish. \u201cIt happened right in here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. I\u2019d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said something funny. A different language, I think it must have been. Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then \u2014\u201d Myrtle swelled importantly, her face shining. \u201cI died.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Myrtle in hushed tones. \u201cI just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away. . . .\u201d She looked dreamily at Harry. \u201cAnd then I came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she\u2019d ever laughed at my glasses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere exactly did you see the eyes?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cSomewhere there,\u201d said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet.\n\nHarry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a look of utter terror on his face.\n\nIt looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake.\n\n\u201cThat tap\u2019s never worked,\u201d said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSay something. Something in Parseltongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d Harry thought hard. The only times he\u2019d ever managed to speak Parseltongue were when he\u2019d been faced with a real snake. He stared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it was real.\n\n\u201cOpen up,\u201d he said.\n\nHe looked at Ron, who shook his head.\n\n\u201cEnglish,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive. If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving.\n\n\u201cOpen up,\u201d he said.\n\nExcept that the words weren\u2019t what he heard; a strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into.\n\nHarry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind what he was going to do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going down there,\u201d he said.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might be alive.\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d said Ron.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\u201cWell, you hardly seem to need me,\u201d said Lockhart, with a shadow of his old smile. \u201cI\u2019ll just \u2014\u201d\n\nHe put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their wands at him.\n\n\u201cYou can go first,\u201d Ron snarled.\n\nWhite-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d he said, his voice feeble. \u201cBoys, what good will it do?\u201d\n\nHarry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the pipe.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think \u2014\u201d he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the pipe, then let go.\n\nIt was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.\n\nAnd then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too.\n\n\u201cWe must be miles under the school,\u201d said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel.\n\n\u201cUnder the lake, probably,\u201d said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls.\n\nAll three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.\n\n\u201cLumos!\u201d Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor.\n\nThe tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.\n\n\u201cRemember,\u201d Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, \u201cany sign of movement, close your eyes right away. . . .\u201d\n\nBut the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat\u2019s skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 there\u2019s something up there \u2014\u201d said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry\u2019s shoulder.\n\nThey froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn\u2019t moving.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s asleep,\u201d he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart\u2019s hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.\n\nVery slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high.\n\nThe light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least.\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said Ron weakly.\n\nThere was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s knees had given way.\n\n\u201cGet up,\u201d said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.\n\nLockhart got to his feet \u2014 then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground.\n\nHarry jumped forward, but too late \u2014 Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron\u2019s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face.\n\n\u201cThe adventure ends here, boys!\u201d he said. \u201cI shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body \u2014 say good-bye to your memories!\u201d\n\nHe raised Ron\u2019s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \u201cObliviate!\u201d\n\nThe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock.\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d he shouted. \u201cAre you okay? Ron!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d came Ron\u2019s muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \u201cI\u2019m okay \u2014 this git\u2019s not, though \u2014 he got blasted by the wand \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a dull thud and a loud \u201cow!\u201d It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Ron\u2019s voice said, sounding desperate. \u201cWe can\u2019t get through \u2014 it\u2019ll take ages. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn\u2019t seem a good moment to try \u2014 what if the whole tunnel caved in?\n\nThere was another thud and another \u201cow!\u201d from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours. . . . Harry knew there was only one thing to do.\n\n\u201cWait there,\u201d he called to Ron. \u201cWait with Lockhart. I\u2019ll go on. . . . If I\u2019m not back in an hour . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a very pregnant pause.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try and shift some of this rock,\u201d said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. \u201cSo you can \u2014 can get back through. And, Harry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you in a bit,\u201d said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice.\n\nAnd he set off alone past the giant snake skin.\n\nSoon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry\u2019s body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he\u2019d find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.\n\nHarry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.\n\nHe could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker.\n\n\u201cOpen,\u201d said Harry, in a low, faint hiss.\n\nThe serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter17": "THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN\n\n\n\n\nHe was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place.\n\nHis heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny?\n\nHe pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.\n\nThen, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.\n\nHarry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard\u2019s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair.\n\n\u201cGinny!\u201d Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. \u201cGinny \u2014 don\u2019t be dead \u2014 please don\u2019t be dead \u2014\u201d He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny\u2019s shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn\u2019t Petrified. But then she must be \u2014\n\n\u201cGinny, please wake up,\u201d Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny\u2019s head lolled hopelessly from side to side.\n\n\u201cShe won\u2019t wake,\u201d said a soft voice.\n\nHarry jumped and spun around on his knees.\n\nA tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him \u2014\n\n\u201cTom \u2014 Tom Riddle?\u201d\n\nRiddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, she won\u2019t wake?\u201d Harry said desperately. \u201cShe\u2019s not \u2014 she\u2019s not \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still alive,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cBut only just.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen.\n\n\u201cAre you a ghost?\u201d Harry said uncertainly.\n\n\u201cA memory,\u201d said Riddle quietly. \u201cPreserved in a diary for fifty years.\u201d\n\nHe pointed toward the floor near the statue\u2019s giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there \u2014 but there were more pressing matters to deal with.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to help me, Tom,\u201d Harry said, raising Ginny\u2019s head again. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get her out of here. There\u2019s a basilisk . . . I don\u2019t know where it is, but it could be along any moment. . . . Please, help me \u2014\u201d\n\nRiddle didn\u2019t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again.\n\nBut his wand had gone.\n\n\u201cDid you see \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHe looked up. Riddle was still watching him \u2014 twirling Harry\u2019s wand between his long fingers.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.\n\nA smile curled the corners of Riddle\u2019s mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny\u2019s dead weight. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go! If the basilisk comes \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t come until it is called,\u201d said Riddle calmly.\n\nHarry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d he said. \u201cLook, give me my wand, I might need it \u2014\u201d\n\nRiddle\u2019s smile broadened.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be needing it,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry stared at him.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, I won\u2019t be \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cFor the chance to see you. To speak to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Harry, losing patience, \u201cI don\u2019t think you get it. We\u2019re in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk now,\u201d said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry\u2019s wand.\n\nHarry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here. . . .\n\n\u201cHow did Ginny get like this?\u201d he asked slowly.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s an interesting question,\u201d said Riddle pleasantly. \u201cAnd quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley\u2019s like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThe diary,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cMy diary. Little Ginny\u2019s been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes \u2014 how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how\u201d \u2014 Riddle\u2019s eyes glinted \u2014 \u201chow she didn\u2019t think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her. . . .\u201d\n\nAll the time he spoke, Riddle\u2019s eyes never left Harry\u2019s face. There was an almost hungry look in them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one\u2019s ever understood me like you, Tom. . . . I\u2019m so glad I\u2019ve got this diary to confide in. . . . It\u2019s like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket. . . .\u201d\n\nRiddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn\u2019t suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cIf I say it myself, Harry, I\u2019ve always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted. . . . I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\u201d said Riddle softly. \u201cGinny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib\u2019s cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry whispered.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Riddle calmly. \u201cOf course, she didn\u2019t know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries . . . far more interesting, they became. . . . Dear Tom,\u201d he recited, watching Harry\u2019s horrified face, \u201cI think I\u2019m losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I don\u2019t know how they got there. Dear Tom, I can\u2019t remember what I did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I\u2019ve got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I\u2019m pale and I\u2019m not myself. I think he suspects me. . . . There was another attack today and I don\u2019t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I\u2019m going mad. . . . I think I\u2019m the one attacking everyone, Tom!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his palms.\n\n\u201cIt took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cBut she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And that\u2019s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I couldn\u2019t have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why did you want to meet me?\u201d said Harry. Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady.\n\n\u201cWell, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cYour whole fascinating history.\u201d His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. \u201cI knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s my friend,\u201d said Harry, his voice now shaking. \u201cAnd you framed him, didn\u2019t you? I thought you made a mistake, but \u2014\u201d\n\nRiddle laughed his high laugh again.\n\n\u201cIt was my word against Hagrid\u2019s, Harry. Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student . . . on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls . . . but I admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn\u2019t possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance . . . as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!\n\n\u201cOnly the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed. . . . Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet Dumbledore saw right through you,\u201d said Harry, his teeth gritted.\n\n\u201cWell, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled,\u201d said Riddle carelessly. \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn\u2019t going to waste those long years I\u2019d spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin\u2019s noble work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you haven\u2019t finished it,\u201d said Harry triumphantly. \u201cNo one\u2019s died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I already told you,\u201d said Riddle quietly, \u201cthat killing Mudbloods doesn\u2019t matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been \u2014 you.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at him.\n\n\u201cImagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who\u2019d been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin\u2019s heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery \u2014 particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue. . . .\n\n\u201cSo I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But there isn\u2019t much life left in her. . . . She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last. . . . I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you\u2019d come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Harry spat, fists still clenched.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \u201chow is it that you \u2014 a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent \u2014 managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort\u2019s powers were destroyed?\u201d\n\nThere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now.\n\n\u201cWhy do you care how I escaped?\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cVoldemort was after your time. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort,\u201d said Riddle softly, \u201cis my past, present, and future, Harry Potter. . . .\u201d\n\nHe pulled Harry\u2019s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words:\n\nTOM MARVOLO RIDDLE\n\nThen he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves:\n\nI AM LORD VOLDEMORT\n\n\u201cYou see?\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father\u2019s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother\u2019s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry \u2014 I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry\u2019s own parents, and so many others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.\n\n\u201cNot what?\u201d snapped Riddle.\n\n\u201cNot the greatest sorcerer in the world,\u201d said Harry, breathing fast. \u201cSorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn\u2019t dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you\u2019re hiding these days \u2014\u201d\n\nThe smile had gone from Riddle\u2019s face, to be replaced by a very ugly look.\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!\u201d he hissed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not as gone as you might think!\u201d Harry retorted. He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true \u2014\n\nRiddle opened his mouth, but froze.\n\nMusic was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry\u2019s scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar.\n\nA crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock\u2019s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle.\n\nA second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.\n\nThe bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry\u2019s cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a phoenix. . . .\u201d said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.\n\n\u201cFawkes?\u201d Harry breathed, and he felt the bird\u2019s golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently.\n\n\u201cAnd that \u2014 \u201d said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, \u201cthat\u2019s the old school Sorting Hat \u2014\u201d\n\nSo it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry\u2019s feet.\n\nRiddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark Chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once \u2014\n\n\u201cThis is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.\n\n\u201cTo business, Harry,\u201d said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \u201cTwice \u2014 in your past, in my future \u2014 we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\u201d he added softly, \u201cthe longer you stay alive.\u201d\n\nHarry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right . . . but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny . . . and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle\u2019s outline was becoming clearer, more solid. . . . If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later.\n\n\u201cNo one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\u201d said Harry abruptly. \u201cI don\u2019t know myself. But I know why you couldn\u2019t kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born mother,\u201d he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \u201cShe stopped you killing me. And I\u2019ve seen the real you, I saw you last year. You\u2019re a wreck. You\u2019re barely alive. That\u2019s where all your power got you. You\u2019re in hiding. You\u2019re ugly, you\u2019re foul \u2014\u201d\n\nRiddle\u2019s face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile.\n\n\u201cSo. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that\u2019s a powerful counter-charm. I can see now . . . there is nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you see. Because there are strange likenesses between us, Harry Potter. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself. We even look something alike. . . . But after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That\u2019s all I wanted to know.\u201d\n\nHarry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle\u2019s twisted smile was widening again.\n\n\u201cNow, Harry, I\u2019m going to teach you a little lesson. Let\u2019s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him. . . .\u201d\n\nHe cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Riddle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed \u2014 but Harry understood what he was saying. . . .\n\n\u201cSpeak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four.\u201d\n\nHarry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder.\n\nSlytherin\u2019s gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole.\n\nAnd something was stirring inside the statue\u2019s mouth. Something was slithering up from its depths.\n\nHarry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes\u2019 wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, \u201cDon\u2019t leave me!\u201d but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents?\n\nSomething huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder \u2014 he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin\u2019s mouth. Then he heard Riddle\u2019s hissing voice:\n\n\u201cKill him.\u201d\n\nThe basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way \u2014 Voldemort was laughing \u2014\n\nHarry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood \u2014 the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming \u2014\n\nThere was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body, he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars \u2014\n\nHe couldn\u2019t help it \u2014 he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on.\n\nThe enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake.\n\nFawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers \u2014\n\nFawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake\u2019s tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned \u2014 Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony.\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Harry heard Riddle screaming. \u201cLEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU! YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM! KILL HIM!\u201d\n\nThe blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes.\n\n\u201cHelp me, help me,\u201d Harry muttered wildly, \u201csomeone \u2014 anyone \u2014\u201d\n\nThe snake\u2019s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit his face.\n\nThe basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry\u2019s arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance \u2014 he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk\u2019s tail swung over him again.\n\nHelp me \u2014 help me \u2014 Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat. Please help me \u2014\n\nThere was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly.\n\nSomething very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry\u2019s head, almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it.\n\nA gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs.\n\n\u201cKILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU! SNIFF \u2014 SMELL HIM!\u201d\n\nHarry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk\u2019s head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous \u2014\n\nIt lunged blindly \u2014 Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry\u2019s side. He raised the sword in both his hands \u2014\n\nThe basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true \u2014 Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent\u2019s mouth \u2014\n\nBut as warm blood drenched Harry\u2019s arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.\n\nHarry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.\n\nA patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.\n\n\u201cFawkes,\u201d said Harry thickly. \u201cYou were fantastic, Fawkes. . . .\u201d He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent\u2019s fang had pierced him.\n\nHe could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dead, Harry Potter,\u201d said Riddle\u2019s voice above him. \u201cDead. Even Dumbledore\u2019s bird knows it. Do you see what he\u2019s doing, Potter? He\u2019s crying.\u201d\n\nHarry blinked. Fawkes\u2019s head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time. I\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d\n\nHarry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning.\n\n\u201cSo ends the famous Harry Potter,\u201d said Riddle\u2019s distant voice. \u201cAlone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You\u2019ll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. . . . She bought you twelve years of borrowed time . . . but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must. . . .\u201d\n\nIf this is dying, thought Harry, it\u2019s not so bad.\n\nEven the pain was leaving him. . . .\n\nBut was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry\u2019s arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound \u2014 except that there was no wound \u2014\n\n\u201cGet away, bird,\u201d said Riddle\u2019s voice suddenly. \u201cGet away from him \u2014 I said, get away \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry\u2019s wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.\n\n\u201cPhoenix tears . . .\u201d said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry\u2019s arm. \u201cOf course . . . healing powers . . . I forgot . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked into Harry\u2019s face. \u201cBut it makes no difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter . . . you and me. . . .\u201d\n\nHe raised the wand \u2014\n\nThen, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry\u2019s lap \u2014 the diary.\n\nFor a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.\n\nThere was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry\u2019s hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then \u2014\n\nHe had gone. Harry\u2019s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it.\n\nShaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he\u2019d just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk\u2019s mouth.\n\nThen came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 oh, Harry \u2014 I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn\u2019t say it in front of Percy \u2014 it was me, Harry \u2014 but I \u2014 I s-swear I d-didn\u2019t mean to \u2014 R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over \u2014 and \u2014 how did you kill that \u2014 that thing? W-where\u2019s Riddle? The last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the diary \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \u201cRiddle\u2019s finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C\u2019mon, Ginny, let\u2019s get out of here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be expelled!\u201d Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I\u2019ll have to leave and \u2014 w-what\u2019ll Mum and Dad say?\u201d\n\nFawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss.\n\nAfter a few minutes\u2019 progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry\u2019s ears.\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d Harry yelled, speeding up. \u201cGinny\u2019s okay! I\u2019ve got her!\u201d\n\nHe heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rockfall.\n\n\u201cGinny!\u201d Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first. \u201cYou\u2019re alive! I don\u2019t believe it! What happened? How \u2014 what \u2014 where did that bird come from?\u201d\n\nFawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s,\u201d said Harry, squeezing through himself.\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019ve got a sword?\u201d said Ron, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain when we get out of here,\u201d said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d Harry said shortly. He didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who\u2019d been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lockhart?\u201d\n\n\u201cBack there,\u201d said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. \u201cHe\u2019s in a bad way. Come and see.\u201d\n\nLed by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself.\n\n\u201cHis memory\u2019s gone,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe Memory Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn\u2019t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He\u2019s a danger to himself.\u201d\n\nLockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cOdd sort of place, this, isn\u2019t it? Do you live here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry.\n\nHarry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.\n\n\u201cHave you thought how we\u2019re going to get back up this?\u201d he said to Ron.\n\nRon shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly at him.\n\n\u201cHe looks like he wants you to grab hold . . .\u201d said Ron, looking perplexed. \u201cBut you\u2019re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFawkes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cisn\u2019t an ordinary bird.\u201d He turned quickly to the others. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron\u2019s hand. Professor Lockhart \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe means you,\u201d said Ron sharply to Lockhart.\n\n\u201cYou hold Ginny\u2019s other hand \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry\u2019s robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes\u2019s strangely hot tail feathers.\n\nAn extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him, saying, \u201cAmazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\u201d The chill air was whipping through Harry\u2019s hair, and before he\u2019d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over \u2014 all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle\u2019s bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place.\n\nMyrtle goggled at them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d she said blankly to Harry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to sound so disappointed,\u201d he said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses.\n\n\u201cOh, well . . . I\u2019d just been thinking . . . if you had died, you\u2019d have been welcome to share my toilet,\u201d said Myrtle, blushing silver.\n\n\u201cUrgh!\u201d said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside. \u201cHarry! I think Myrtle\u2019s grown fond of you! You\u2019ve got competition, Ginny!\u201d\n\nBut tears were still flooding silently down Ginny\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhere now?\u201d said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed.\n\nFawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall\u2019s office.\n\nHarry knocked and pushed the door open."}
{"2-Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-chapter18": "DOBBY\u2019S REWARD\n\n\n\n\nFor a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry\u2019s case) blood. Then there was a scream.\n\n\u201cGinny!\u201d\n\nIt was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter.\n\nHarry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes went whooshing past Harry\u2019s ear and settled on Dumbledore\u2019s shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasley\u2019s tight embrace.\n\n\u201cYou saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019d all like to know that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall weakly.\n\nMrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle\u2019s diary.\n\nThen he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom. . . .\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, \u201cso you found out where the entrance was \u2014 breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add \u2014 but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?\u201d\n\nSo Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes\u2019s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle\u2019s diary \u2014 or Ginny. She was standing with her head against Mrs. Weasley\u2019s shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle\u2019s diary didn\u2019t work anymore. . . . How could they prove it had been he who\u2019d made her do it all?\n\nInstinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles.\n\n\u201cWhat interests me most,\u201d said Dumbledore gently, \u201cis how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.\u201d\n\nRelief \u2014 warm, sweeping, glorious relief \u2014 swept over Harry.\n\n\u201cW-what\u2019s that?\u201d said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \u201cYou-Know-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny\u2019s not . . . Ginny hasn\u2019t been . . . has she?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this diary,\u201d said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore. \u201cRiddle wrote it when he was sixteen. . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.\n\n\u201cBrilliant,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOf course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\u201d He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.\n\n\u201cVery few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the school . . . traveled far and wide . . . sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Ginny,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cWhat\u2019s our Ginny got to do with \u2014 with \u2014 him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis d-diary!\u201d Ginny sobbed. \u201cI\u2019ve b-been writing in it, and he\u2019s been w-writing back all year \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGinny!\u201d said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \u201cHaven\u2019t I taught you anything? What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can\u2019t see where it keeps its brain. Why didn\u2019t you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI d-didn\u2019t know,\u201d sobbed Ginny. \u201cI found it inside one of the books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,\u201d Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. \u201cThis has been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.\u201d He strode over to the door and opened it. \u201cBed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,\u201d he added, twinkling kindly down at her. \u201cYou will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. She\u2019s just giving out Mandrake juice \u2014 I daresay the basilisk\u2019s victims will be waking up any moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Hermione\u2019s okay!\u201d said Ron brightly.\n\n\u201cThere has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nMrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking deeply shaken.\n\n\u201cYou know, Minerva,\u201d Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, \u201cI think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nShe left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely \u2014 surely \u2014 they weren\u2019t about to be punished?\n\n\u201cI seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nRon opened his mouth in horror.\n\n\u201cWhich goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,\u201d Dumbledore went on, smiling. \u201cYou will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and \u2014 let me see \u2014 yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nRon went as brightly pink as Lockhart\u2019s valentine flowers and closed his mouth again.\n\n\u201cBut one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure,\u201d Dumbledore added. \u201cWhy so modest, Gilderoy?\u201d\n\nHarry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore,\u201d Ron said quickly, \u201cthere was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I a professor?\u201d said Lockhart in mild surprise. \u201cGoodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,\u201d Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cDear me,\u201d said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mustache quivering. \u201cImpaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!\u201d\n\n\u201cSword?\u201d said Lockhart dimly. \u201cHaven\u2019t got a sword. That boy has, though.\u201d He pointed at Harry. \u201cHe\u2019ll lend you one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?\u201d Dumbledore said to Ron. \u201cI\u2019d like a few more words with Harry. . . .\u201d\n\nLockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door.\n\nDumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire.\n\n\u201cSit down, Harry,\u201d he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Harry, I want to thank you,\u201d said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. \u201cYou must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.\u201d\n\nHe stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him.\n\n\u201cAnd so you met Tom Riddle,\u201d said Dumbledore thoughtfully. \u201cI imagine he was most interested in you. . . .\u201d\n\nSuddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of his mouth.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore . . . Riddle said I\u2019m like him. Strange likenesses, he said. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he, now?\u201d said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows. \u201cAnd what do you think, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m like him!\u201d said Harry, more loudly than he\u2019d intended. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m in Gryffindor, I\u2019m . . .\u201d\n\nBut he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d he started again after a moment. \u201cThe Sorting Hat told me I\u2019d \u2014 I\u2019d have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin\u2019s heir for a while . . . because I can speak Parseltongue. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can speak Parseltongue, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly, \u201cbecause Lord Voldemort \u2014 who is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin \u2014 can speak Parseltongue. Unless I\u2019m much mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I\u2019m sure. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort put a bit of himself in me?\u201d Harry said, thunderstruck.\n\n\u201cIt certainly seems so.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I should be in Slytherin,\u201d Harry said, looking desperately into Dumbledore\u2019s face. \u201cThe Sorting Hat could see Slytherin\u2019s power in me, and it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPut you in Gryffindor,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cListen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue \u2014 resourcefulness \u2014 determination \u2014 a certain disregard for rules,\u201d he added, his mustache quivering again. \u201cYet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt only put me in Gryffindor,\u201d said Harry in a defeated voice, \u201cbecause I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming once more. \u201cWhich makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\u201d Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned. \u201cIf you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.\u201d\n\nDumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall\u2019s desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt.\n\nGodric Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cOnly a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore simply.\n\nFor a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall\u2019s desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink.\n\n\u201cWhat you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban \u2014 we need our gamekeeper back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\u201d he added thoughtfully. \u201cWe\u2019ll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. . . . Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nHarry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall.\n\nLucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.\n\n\u201cGood evening, Lucius,\u201d said Dumbledore pleasantly.\n\nMr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room. Dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject terror on his face.\n\nThe elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoy\u2019s shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cSo!\u201d he said \u201cYou\u2019ve come back. The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you see, Lucius,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, \u201cthe other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They\u2019d heard that Arthur Weasley\u2019s daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all. Very strange tales they told me, too. . . . Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn\u2019t agree to suspend me in the first place.\u201d\n\nMr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of fury.\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 have you stopped the attacks yet?\u201d he sneered. \u201cHave you caught the culprit?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have,\u201d said Dumbledore, with a smile.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Mr. Malfoy sharply. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same person as last time, Lucius,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means of this diary.\u201d\n\nHe held up the small black book with the large hole through the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching Dobby.\n\nThe elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist.\n\n\u201cI see . . .\u201d said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cA clever plan,\u201d said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. \u201cBecause if Harry here\u201d \u2014 Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look \u2014 \u201cand his friend Ron hadn\u2019t discovered this book, why \u2014 Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn\u2019t acted of her own free will. . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike.\n\n\u201cAnd imagine,\u201d Dumbledore went on, \u201cwhat might have happened then. . . . The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing Muggle-borns. . . . Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle\u2019s memories wiped from it. Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise. . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Malfoy forced himself to speak.\n\n\u201cVery fortunate,\u201d he said stiffly.\n\nAnd still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head.\n\nAnd Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?\u201d said Harry.\n\nLucius Malfoy rounded on him.\n\n\u201cHow should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause you gave it to her,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIn Flourish and Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHe saw Mr. Malfoy\u2019s white hands clench and unclench.\n\n\u201cProve it,\u201d he hissed.\n\n\u201cOh, no one will be able to do that,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry. \u201cNot now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort\u2019s old school things. If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you. . . .\u201d\n\nLucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to his house-elf.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going, Dobby!\u201d\n\nHe wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him, he kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard. Then it came to him \u2014\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore,\u201d he said hurriedly. \u201cCan I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cBut hurry. The feast, remember. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear Dobby\u2019s squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it. Then he ran down the dark corridor.\n\nHe caught up with them at the top of the stairs.\n\n\u201cMr. Malfoy,\u201d he gasped, skidding to a halt, \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nMr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, Harry Potter,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThey were meddlesome fools, too.\u201d\n\nHe turned to go.\n\n\u201cCome, Dobby. I said, come.\u201d\n\nBut Dobby didn\u2019t move. He was holding up Harry\u2019s disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.\n\n\u201cMaster has given a sock,\u201d said the elf in wonderment. \u201cMaster gave it to Dobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d spat Mr. Malfoy. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot a sock,\u201d said Dobby in disbelief. \u201cMaster threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby \u2014 Dobby is free.\u201d\n\nLucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lost me my servant, boy!\u201d\n\nBut Dobby shouted, \u201cYou shall not harm Harry Potter!\u201d\n\nThere was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.\n\n\u201cYou shall go now,\u201d he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. \u201cYou shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.\u201d\n\nLucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter freed Dobby!\u201d said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. \u201cHarry Potter set Dobby free!\u201d\n\n\u201cLeast I could do, Dobby,\u201d said Harry, grinning. \u201cJust promise never to try and save my life again.\u201d\n\nThe elf\u2019s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just got one question, Dobby,\u201d said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry\u2019s sock with shaking hands. \u201cYou told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a clue, sir,\u201d said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. \u201cWas giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry weakly. \u201cWell, I\u2019d better go. There\u2019s a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now. . . .\u201d\n\nDobby threw his arms around Harry\u2019s middle and hugged him.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\u201d he sobbed. \u201cFarewell, Harry Potter!\u201d\n\nAnd with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared.\n\nHarry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn\u2019t know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming \u201cYou solved it! You solved it!\u201d or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron\u2019s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\u201cOh, no!\u201d said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news.\n\n\u201cShame,\u201d said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \u201cHe was starting to grow on me.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences. Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\u201cbut we\u2019ve had plenty of practice at that anyway,\u201d Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again.\n\nToo soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George\u2019s Filibuster fireworks, and practiced Disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it.\n\nThey were almost at King\u2019s Cross when Harry remembered something.\n\n\u201cGinny \u2014 what did you see Percy doing, that he didn\u2019t want you to tell anyone?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that,\u201d said Ginny, giggling. \u201cWell \u2014 Percy\u2019s got a girlfriend.\u201d\n\nFred dropped a stack of books on George\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cThat\u2019s who he was writing to all last summer. He\u2019s been meeting her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was \u2014 you know \u2014 attacked. You won\u2019t tease him, will you?\u201d she added anxiously.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d said Fred, who was looking like his birthday had come early.\n\n\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d said George, sniggering.\n\nThe Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped.\n\nHarry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cThis is called a telephone number,\u201d he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. \u201cI told your dad how to use a telephone last summer \u2014 he\u2019ll know. Call me at the Dursleys\u2019, okay? I can\u2019t stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYour aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won\u2019t they?\u201d said Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. \u201cWhen they hear what you did this year?\u201d\n\n\u201cProud?\u201d said Harry. \u201cAre you crazy? All those times I could\u2019ve died, and I didn\u2019t manage it? They\u2019ll be furious. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world."}
