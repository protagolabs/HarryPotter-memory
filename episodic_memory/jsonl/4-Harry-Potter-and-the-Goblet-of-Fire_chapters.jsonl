{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter1": "THE RIDDLE HOUSE\n\n\n\n\nThe villagers of Little Hangleton still called it \u201cthe Riddle House,\u201d even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.\n\nThe Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was \u201ccreepy.\u201d Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce. The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore. Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer\u2019s morning, when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.\n\nThe maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.\n\n\u201cLying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their dinner things!\u201d\n\nThe police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement. Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer \u2014 for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.\n\nThe Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles\u2019 cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.\n\n\u201cFrank!\u201d cried several people. \u201cNever!\u201d\n\nFrank Bryce was the Riddles\u2019 gardener. He lived alone in a run-down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since.\n\nThere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.\n\n\u201cAlways thought he was odd,\u201d she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry. \u201cUnfriendly, like. I\u2019m sure if I\u2019ve offered him a cuppa once, I\u2019ve offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, now,\u201d said a woman at the bar, \u201che had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That\u2019s no reason to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho else had a key to the back door, then?\u201d barked the cook. \u201cThere\u2019s been a spare key hanging in the gardener\u2019s cottage far back as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping. . . .\u201d\n\nThe villagers exchanged dark looks.\n\n\u201cI always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,\u201d grunted a man at the bar.\n\n\u201cWar turned him funny, if you ask me,\u201d said the landlord.\n\n\u201cTold you I wouldn\u2019t like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn\u2019t I, Dot?\u201d said an excited woman in the corner.\n\n\u201cHorrible temper,\u201d said Dot, nodding fervently. \u201cI remember, when he was a kid . . .\u201d\n\nBy the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.\n\nBut over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles\u2019 deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale. Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure that Frank had invented him.\n\nThen, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles\u2019 bodies came back and changed everything.\n\nThe police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfect health \u2014 apart from the fact that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face \u2014 but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?\n\nAs there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while. To everyone\u2019s surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.\n\n\u201c\u2019S far as I\u2019m concerned, he killed them, and I don\u2019t care what the police say,\u201d said Dot in the Hanged Man. \u201cAnd if he had any decency, he\u2019d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.\u201d\n\nBut Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next \u2014 for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.\n\nThe wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for \u201ctax reasons,\u201d though nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.\n\nWeeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old Frank\u2019s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, thought him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.\n\nIt was Frank\u2019s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.\n\nFrank had no telephone, and in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles\u2019 deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.\n\nThe front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.\n\nHe let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way toward it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.\n\nOn the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were: At the very end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, grasping his walking stick firmly. Several feet from the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.\n\nThe fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man\u2019s voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.\n\n\u201cThere is a little more in the bottle, my Lord, if you are still hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater,\u201d said a second voice. This too belonged to a man \u2014 but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank\u2019s neck stand up. \u201cMove me closer to the fire, Wormtail.\u201d\n\nFrank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of sight again.\n\n\u201cWhere is Nagini?\u201d said the cold voice.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I don\u2019t know, my Lord,\u201d said the first voice nervously. \u201cShe set out to explore the house, I think. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,\u201d said the second voice. \u201cI will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly.\u201d\n\nBrow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.\n\n\u201cMy Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?\u201d\n\n\u201cA week,\u201d said the cold voice. \u201cPerhaps longer. The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.\u201d\n\nFrank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word \u201cQuidditch,\u201d which was not a word at all.\n\n\u201cThe \u2014 the Quidditch World Cup, my Lord?\u201d said Wormtail. (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.) \u201cForgive me, but \u2014 I do not understand \u2014 why should we wait until the World Cup is over?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double-checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.\u201d\n\nFrank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words \u201cMinistry of Magic,\u201d \u201cwizards,\u201d and \u201cMuggles.\u201d Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.\n\n\u201cYour Lordship is still determined, then?\u201d Wormtail said quietly.\n\n\u201cCertainly I am determined, Wormtail.\u201d There was a note of menace in the cold voice now.\n\nA slight pause followed \u2014 and then Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.\n\n\u201cIt could be done without Harry Potter, my Lord.\u201d\n\nAnother pause, more protracted, and then \u2014\n\n\u201cWithout Harry Potter?\u201d breathed the second voice softly. \u201cI see . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!\u201d said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. \u201cThe boy is nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard \u2014 any wizard \u2014 the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while \u2014 you know that I can disguise myself most effectively \u2014 I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI could use another wizard,\u201d said the cold voice softly, \u201cthat is true. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord, it makes sense,\u201d said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now. \u201cLaying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder . . . perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord! I \u2014 I have no wish to leave you, none at all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not lie to me!\u201d hissed the second voice. \u201cI can always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! My devotion to Your Lordship \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you seem so much stronger, my Lord \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLiar,\u201d breathed the second voice. \u201cI am no stronger, and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care. Silence!\u201d\n\nWormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. Then the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.\n\n\u201cI have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail \u2014 courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort\u2019s wrath \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord, I must speak!\u201d said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. \u201cAll through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head \u2014 my Lord, Bertha Jorkins\u2019s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf?\u201d whispered the second voice. \u201cIf? If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that I could do it myself, but in my present condition . . . Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful servant will have rejoined us \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a faithful servant,\u201d said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.\n\n\u201cWormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found you,\u201d said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now. \u201cI was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said the second man, sounding amused. \u201cA stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail \u2014 though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I thought she might be useful, my Lord \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLiar,\u201d said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever. \u201cHowever, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cR-really, my Lord? What \u2014 ?\u201d Wormtail sounded terrified again.\n\n\u201cAh, Wormtail, you don\u2019t want me to spoil the surprise? Your part will come at the very end . . . but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou . . . you . . .\u201d Wormtail\u2019s voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. \u201cYou . . . are going . . . to kill me too?\u201d\n\n\u201cWormtail, Wormtail,\u201d said the cold voice silkily, \u201cwhy would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns. . . .\u201d\n\nWormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh \u2014 an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.\n\n\u201cWe could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.\u201d\n\nOut in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without any kind of remorse \u2014 with amusement. He was dangerous \u2014 a madman. And he was planning more murders \u2014 this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was \u2014 was in danger \u2014\n\nFrank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village . . . but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.\n\n\u201cOne more murder . . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts . . . Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet . . . I think I hear Nagini. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd the second man\u2019s voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.\n\nAnd then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.\n\nSomething was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer \u2014 What was he to do? The only means of escape was into the room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him \u2014\n\nBut before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.\n\nThere was sweat on Frank\u2019s forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea. . . . This man could talk to snakes.\n\nFrank didn\u2019t understand what was going on. He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs didn\u2019t seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.\n\n\u201cNagini has interesting news, Wormtail,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cIn-indeed, my Lord?\u201d said Wormtail.\n\n\u201cIndeed, yes,\u201d said the voice. \u201cAccording to Nagini, there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say.\u201d\n\nFrank didn\u2019t have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps, and then the door of the room was flung wide open.\n\nA short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face.\n\n\u201cInvite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?\u201d\n\nThe cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but Frank couldn\u2019t see the speaker. The snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.\n\nWormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold.\n\nThe fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn\u2019t even see the back of his head.\n\n\u201cYou heard everything, Muggle?\u201d said the cold voice.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re calling me?\u201d said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.\n\n\u201cI am calling you a Muggle,\u201d said the voice coolly. \u201cIt means that you are not a wizard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by wizard,\u201d said Frank, his voice growing steadier. \u201cAll I know is I\u2019ve heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You\u2019ve done murder and you\u2019re planning more! And I\u2019ll tell you this too,\u201d he added, on a sudden inspiration, \u201cmy wife knows I\u2019m up here, and if I don\u2019t come back \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no wife,\u201d said the cold voice, very quietly. \u201cNobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows . . . he always knows. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d said Frank roughly. \u201cLord, is it? Well, I don\u2019t think much of your manners, my Lord. Turn \u2019round and face me like a man, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am not a man, Muggle,\u201d said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. \u201cI am much, much more than a man. However . . . why not? I will face you. . . . Wormtail, come turn my chair around.\u201d\n\nThe servant gave a whimper.\n\n\u201cYou heard me, Wormtail.\u201d\n\nSlowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.\n\nAnd then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.\n\nTwo hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter2": "THE SCAR\n\n\n\n\nHarry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.\n\nHe sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.\n\nHarry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.\n\nHarry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real. . . . There had been two people he knew and one he didn\u2019t. . . . He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember. . . .\n\nThe dim picture of a darkened room came to him. . . . There had been a snake on a hearth rug . . . a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail . . . and a cold, high voice . . . the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought. . . .\n\nHe closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible. . . . All Harry knew was that at the moment when Voldemort\u2019s chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken him . . . or had that been the pain in his scar?\n\nAnd who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused. Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them. . . . Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry could not remember the name . . . and they had been plotting to kill someone else . . . him!\n\nHarry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there. As it happened, there were an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.\n\nHarry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch \u2014 in Harry\u2019s opinion, the best sport in the world \u2014 couldn\u2019t distract him at the moment. He placed Flying with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street below.\n\nPrivet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn\u2019t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.\n\nAnd yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn\u2019t the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.\n\nNo, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by. . . . But Voldemort couldn\u2019t be here, now. . . . The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible. . . .\n\nHarry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half-expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.\n\nHarry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.\n\nAsleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn\u2019t as though they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were Harry\u2019s only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot. They had explained away Harry\u2019s long absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus\u2019s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn\u2019t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the Wizarding world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was laughable.\n\nAnd yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn\u2019t been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn\u2019t been for Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents. . . .\n\nHarry had been a year old the night that Voldemort \u2014 the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years \u2014 arrived at his house and killed his father and mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power \u2014 and, incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort\u2019s followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had become famous.\n\nIt had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden Wizarding world knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again.\n\nBut there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school. He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July. What would they say if Harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting?\n\nAt once, Hermione Granger\u2019s voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky.\n\n\u201cYour scar hurt? Harry, that\u2019s really serious. . . . Write to Professor Dumbledore! And I\u2019ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. . . . Maybe there\u2019s something in there about curse scars. . . .\u201d\n\nYes, that would be Hermione\u2019s advice: Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort\u2019s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full-length wizard\u2019s robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose. Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him; Harry\u2019s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address. But what would he write?\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this morning. Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.\n\nEven inside his head the words sounded stupid.\n\nAnd so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley\u2019s, reaction, and in a moment, Ron\u2019s red hair and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.\n\n\u201cYour scar hurt? But . . . but You-Know-Who can\u2019t be near you now, can he? I mean . . . you\u2019d know, wouldn\u2019t you? He\u2019d be trying to do you in again, wouldn\u2019t he? I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit. . . . I\u2019ll ask Dad. . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn\u2019t have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew. In any case, Harry didn\u2019t like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments\u2019 pain. Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron\u2019s sixteen-year-old twin brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys were Harry\u2019s favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn\u2019t want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.\n\nHarry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like \u2014 someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic. . . .\n\nAnd then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn\u2019t believe it had taken so long \u2014 Sirius.\n\nHarry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn\u2019t thought of Sirius straight away. But then, perhaps it wasn\u2019t so surprising \u2014 after all, he had only found out that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.\n\nThere was a simple reason for Sirius\u2019s complete absence from Harry\u2019s life until then \u2014 Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent \u2014 the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort\u2019s supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.\n\nFor one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away from him \u2014 Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life. Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever.\n\nNevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn\u2019t be with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather \u2014 for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.\n\nHarry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight; perhaps that was why Sirius had gone south. Sirius\u2019s letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under Harry\u2019s bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to now, all right. . . .\n\nHarry\u2019s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia\u2019s room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.\n\nDear Sirius,\n\nThanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly get through my window.\n\nThings are the same as usual here. Dudley\u2019s diet isn\u2019t going too well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him they\u2019d have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That\u2019s a sort of computer thing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn\u2019t even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off things.\n\nI\u2019m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.\n\nA weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again. Last time that happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don\u2019t reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward?\n\nI\u2019ll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she\u2019s off hunting at the moment. Say hello to Buckbeak for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point putting in the dream; he didn\u2019t want it to look as though he was too worried. He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his reflection, he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter3": "THE INVITATION\n\n\n\n\nBy the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated around the table. None of them looked up as he entered or sat down. Uncle Vernon\u2019s large red face was hidden behind the morning\u2019s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth.\n\nDudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual. This was saying something, as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley\u2019s plate with a tremulous \u201cThere you are, Diddy darling,\u201d Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year report.\n\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn\u2019t understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that \u201che didn\u2019t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway.\u201d They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly!\u201d Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.\n\nHowever, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big-boned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn\u2019t stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia\u2019s eyes \u2014 so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors \u2014 simply refused to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.\n\nSo \u2014 after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry\u2019s bedroom floor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia \u2014 the new regime had begun. The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all Dudley\u2019s favorite things \u2014 fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers \u2014 and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called \u201crabbit food.\u201d To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley\u2019s. Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to keep up Dudley\u2019s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than Harry.\n\nBut Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all. The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the occasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned from Hermione\u2019s house with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks. (Hermione\u2019s parents were dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry hadn\u2019t touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid\u2019s cooking.) Mrs. Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from the journey. And then on Harry\u2019s birthday (which the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes, one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius. Harry still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.\n\nUncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter.\n\n\u201cIs this it?\u201d he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.\n\nAunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at Dudley, who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry\u2019s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.\n\nUncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy mustache, and picked up his spoon.\n\nThe doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall. Quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle, Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon\u2019s grapefruit.\n\nHarry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and Uncle Vernon answering curtly. Then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.\n\nAunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to. She didn\u2019t have to wait long to find out; after about a minute, he was back. He looked livid.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d he barked at Harry. \u201cIn the living room. Now.\u201d\n\nBewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room. Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest. \u201cSo.\u201d\n\nHarry would have dearly loved to have said, \u201cSo what?\u201d but he didn\u2019t feel that Uncle Vernon\u2019s temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food. He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.\n\n\u201cThis just arrived,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of purple writing paper at Harry. \u201cA letter. About you.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about him? Who did he know who sent letters by the postman?\n\nUncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud:\n\nDear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,\n\nWe have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.\n\nAs Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes place this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.\n\nI do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn\u2019t hosted the Cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard to come by. We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to school.\n\nIt would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and I am not sure he even knows where it is.\n\nHoping to see Harry soon,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\nP.S. I do hope we\u2019ve put enough stamps on.\n\n\n\n\n\nUncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket, and drew out something else.\n\n\u201cLook at this,\u201d he growled.\n\nHe held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley\u2019s letter had come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh. Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys\u2019 address in minute writing.\n\n\u201cShe did put enough stamps on, then,\u201d said Harry, trying to sound as though Mrs. Weasley\u2019s was a mistake anyone could make. His uncle\u2019s eyes flashed.\n\n\u201cThe postman noticed,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cVery interested to know where this letter came from, he was. That\u2019s why he rang the doorbell. Seemed to think it was funny.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t say anything. Other people might not understand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary. Their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.\n\nUncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral. If he didn\u2019t do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to say something, but he merely continued to glare. Harry decided to break the silence.\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 can I go then?\u201d he asked.\n\nA slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon\u2019s large purple face. The mustache bristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon\u2019s most fundamental instincts came into conflict. Allowing Harry to go would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys\u2019 for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. Weasley\u2019s letter again.\n\n\u201cWho is this woman?\u201d he said, staring at the signature with distaste.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen her,\u201d said Harry. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend Ron\u2019s mother, she was meeting him off the Hog \u2014 off the school train at the end of last term.\u201d\n\nHe had almost said \u201cHogwarts Express,\u201d and that was a sure way to get his uncle\u2019s temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry\u2019s school aloud in the Dursley household.\n\nUncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant.\n\n\u201cDumpy sort of woman?\u201d he growled finally. \u201cLoad of children with red hair?\u201d\n\nHarry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone \u201cdumpy,\u201d when his own son, Dudley, had finally achieved what he\u2019d been threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than he was tall.\n\nUncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.\n\n\u201cQuidditch,\u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201cQuidditch \u2014 what is this rubbish?\u201d\n\nHarry felt a second stab of annoyance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sport,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cPlayed on broom \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry saw, with some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky. Apparently his nerves couldn\u2019t stand the sound of the word \u201cbroomsticks\u201d in his living room. He took refuge in perusing the letter again. Harry saw his lips form the words \u201csend us your answer . . . in the normal way.\u201d He scowled.\n\n\u201cWhat does she mean, \u2018the normal way\u2019?\u201d he spat.\n\n\u201cNormal for us,\u201d said Harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added, \u201cyou know, owl post. That\u2019s what\u2019s normal for wizards.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass.\n\n\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?\u201d he hissed, his face now a rich plum color. \u201cYou stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly after Dudley finished with them,\u201d said Harry coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.\n\n\u201cI will not be spoken to like that!\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trembling with rage.\n\nBut Harry wasn\u2019t going to stand for this. Gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursleys\u2019 stupid rules. He wasn\u2019t following Dudley\u2019s diet, and he wasn\u2019t going to let Uncle Vernon stop him from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a deep, steadying breath and then said, \u201cOkay, I can\u2019t see the World Cup. Can I go now, then? Only I\u2019ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know \u2014 my godfather.\u201d\n\nHe had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he watched the purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon\u2019s face, making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re writing to him, are you?\u201d said Uncle Vernon, in a would-be calm voice \u2014 but Harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 yeah,\u201d said Harry, casually. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn\u2019t, he might start thinking something\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nHe stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words. He could almost see the cogs working under Uncle Vernon\u2019s thick, dark, neatly parted hair. If he tried to stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated. If he told Harry he couldn\u2019t go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius, who would know Harry was being mistreated. There was only one thing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle\u2019s mind as though the great mustached face were transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible. And then \u2014\n\n\u201cWell, all right then. You can go to this ruddy . . . this stupid . . . this World Cup thing. You write and tell these \u2014 these Weasleys they\u2019re to pick you up, mind. I haven\u2019t got time to go dropping you off all over the country. And you can spend the rest of the summer there. And you can tell your \u2014 your godfather . . . tell him . . . tell him you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d said Harry brightly.\n\nHe turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop. He was going . . . he was going to the Weasleys\u2019, he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup!\n\nOutside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off. He looked shocked to see the broad grin on Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThat was an excellent breakfast, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI feel really full, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nLaughing at the astonished look on Dudley\u2019s face, Harry took the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom.\n\nThe first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting in her cage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something. Exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once.\n\n\u201cOUCH!\u201d said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head. Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet. Harry bent down, recognized Ron\u2019s handwriting, then tore open the envelope. Inside was a hastily scribbled note.\n\nHarry \u2014 DAD GOT THE TICKETS \u2014 Ireland versus Bulgaria, Monday night. Mum\u2019s writing to the Muggles to ask you to stay. They might already have the letter, I don\u2019t know how fast Muggle post is. Thought I\u2019d send this with Pig anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry stared at the word \u201cPig,\u201d then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling. He had never seen anything that looked less like a pig. Maybe he couldn\u2019t read Ron\u2019s writing. He went back to the letter:\n\nWe\u2019re coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you can\u2019t miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon it\u2019s better if we pretend to ask their permission first. If they say yes, send Pig back with your answer pronto, and we\u2019ll come and get you at five o\u2019clock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto and we\u2019ll come and get you at five o\u2019clock on Sunday anyway.\n\nHermione\u2019s arriving this afternoon. Percy\u2019s started work \u2014 the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Don\u2019t mention anything about Abroad while you\u2019re here unless you want the pants bored off you.\n\nSee you soon \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCalm down!\u201d Harry said as the small owl flew low over his head, twittering madly with what Harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person. \u201cCome here, I need you to take my answer back!\u201d\n\nThe owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig\u2019s cage. Hedwig looked coldly up at it, as though daring it to try and come any closer.\n\nHarry seized his eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh piece of parchment, and wrote:\n\nRon, it\u2019s all okay, the Muggles say I can come. See you five o\u2019clock tomorrow. Can\u2019t wait.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe folded this note up very small, and with immense difficulty, tied it to the tiny owl\u2019s leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement. The moment the note was secure, the owl was off again; it zoomed out of the window and out of sight.\n\nHarry turned to Hedwig.\n\n\u201cFeeling up to a long journey?\u201d he asked her.\n\nHedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way.\n\n\u201cCan you take this to Sirius for me?\u201d he said, picking up his letter. \u201cHang on . . . I just want to finish it.\u201d\n\nHe unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript.\n\nIf you want to contact me, I\u2019ll be at my friend Ron Weasley\u2019s for the rest of the summer. His dad\u2019s got us tickets for the Quidditch World Cup!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig\u2019s leg; she kept unusually still, as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be at Ron\u2019s when you get back, all right?\u201d Harry told her.\n\nShe nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing noise, spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window.\n\nHarry watched her out of sight, then crawled under his bed, wrenched up the loose floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake. He sat there on the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through him. He had cake, and Dudley had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer\u2019s day, he would be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar felt perfectly normal again, and he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup. It was hard, just now, to feel worried about anything \u2014 even Lord Voldemort."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter4": "BACK TO THE BURROW\n\n\n\n\nBy twelve o\u2019clock the next day, Harry\u2019s school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions \u2014 the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year. He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, double-checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.\n\nThe atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely tense. The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked downright alarmed when Harry informed him that the Weasleys would be arriving at five o\u2019clock the very next day.\n\n\u201cI hope you told them to dress properly, these people,\u201d he snarled at once. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They\u2019d better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nHarry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call \u201cnormal.\u201d Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness. Harry wasn\u2019t bothered about what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards.\n\nUncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating. Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished. This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully-grown wizard with a curly pig\u2019s tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London. It wasn\u2019t altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.\n\nLunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn\u2019t even protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn\u2019t eating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be driving, of course?\u201d Uncle Vernon barked across the table.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick him up? They didn\u2019t have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d said Harry.\n\nUncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were. But Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr. Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.\n\nHarry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn\u2019t stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room.\n\nAunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car. Dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly around his bottom. Harry couldn\u2019t take the tension; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.\n\nBut five o\u2019clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew his head quickly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re late!\u201d he snarled at Harry.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMaybe \u2014 er \u2014 the traffic\u2019s bad, or something.\u201d\n\nTen past five . . . then a quarter past five . . . Harry was starting to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.\n\n\u201cNo consideration at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe might\u2019ve had an engagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they think they\u2019ll get invited to dinner if they\u2019re late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they most certainly won\u2019t be,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, and Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room. \u201cThey\u2019ll take the boy and go, there\u2019ll be no hanging around. That\u2019s if they\u2019re coming at all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay their kind don\u2019t set much store by punctuality. Either that or they drive some tin-pot car that\u2019s broken d \u2014 AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!\u201d\n\nHarry jumped up. From the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, across the room. Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nBut Dudley didn\u2019t seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry hurried into the living room.\n\nLoud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the Dursleys\u2019 boarded-up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of it.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the fire. \u201cWhat is it, Vernon?\u201d\n\nBut they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.\n\n\u201cOuch! Fred, no \u2014 go back, go back, there\u2019s been some kind of mistake \u2014 tell George not to \u2014 OUCH! George, no, there\u2019s no room, go back quickly and tell Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe Harry can hear us, Dad \u2014 maybe he\u2019ll be able to let us out \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire.\n\n\u201cHarry? Harry, can you hear us?\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d growled Uncle Vernon. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey \u2014 they\u2019ve tried to get here by Floo powder,\u201d said Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh. \u201cThey can travel by fire \u2014 only you\u2019ve blocked the fireplace \u2014 hang on \u2014\u201d\n\nHe approached the fireplace and called through the boards.\n\n\u201cMr. Weasley? Can you hear me?\u201d\n\nThe hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney piece said, \u201cShh!\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Weasley, it\u2019s Harry . . . the fireplace has been blocked up. You won\u2019t be able to get through there.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn!\u201d said Mr. Weasley\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got an electric fire,\u201d Harry explained.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Mr. Weasley\u2019s voice excitedly. \u201cEclectic, you say? With a plug? Gracious, I must see that. . . . Let\u2019s think . . . ouch, Ron!\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s voice now joined the others\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, Ron,\u201d came Fred\u2019s voice, very sarcastically. \u201cNo, this is exactly where we wanted to end up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re having the time of our lives here,\u201d said George, whose voice sounded muffled, as though he was squashed against the wall.\n\n\u201cBoys, boys . . .\u201d said Mr. Weasley vaguely. \u201cI\u2019m trying to think what to do. . . . Yes . . . only way . . . Stand back, Harry.\u201d\n\nHarry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved forward.\n\n\u201cWait a moment!\u201d he bellowed at the fire. \u201cWhat exactly are you going to \u2014\u201d\n\nBANG.\n\nThe electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical to the last freckle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses. \u201cAh \u2014 you must be Harry\u2019s aunt and uncle!\u201d\n\nTall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia. Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes \u2014 sorry about that,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. It just didn\u2019t occur to me that we wouldn\u2019t be able to get out at the other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you see \u2014 just for an afternoon, you know, so we could get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren\u2019t supposed to be connected, strictly speaking \u2014 but I\u2019ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate.\u201d\n\nHarry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn\u2019t understood a single word of this. They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cHello, Harry!\u201d said Mr. Weasley brightly. \u201cGot your trunk ready?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s upstairs,\u201d said Harry, grinning back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get it,\u201d said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and George left the room. They knew where Harry\u2019s bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the dead of night. Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence. \u201cVery \u2014 erm \u2014 very nice place you\u2019ve got here.\u201d\n\nAs the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn\u2019t go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon\u2019s face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again. However, they seemed too scared to actually say anything.\n\nMr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.\n\n\u201cThey run off eckeltricity, do they?\u201d he said knowledgeably. \u201cAh yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,\u201d he added to Uncle Vernon. \u201cAnd batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I\u2019m mad, but there you are.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.\n\nDudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon\u2019s bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.\n\n\u201cAh, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?\u201d said Mr. Weasley, taking another brave stab at making conversation.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat\u2019s Dudley.\u201d\n\nHe and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley\u2019s peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.\n\n\u201cHaving a good holiday, Dudley?\u201d he said kindly.\n\nDudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside.\n\nFred and George came back into the room carrying Harry\u2019s school trunk. They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical evil grins.\n\n\u201cAh, right,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cBetter get cracking then.\u201d\n\nHe pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand. Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.\n\n\u201cIncendio!\u201d said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him.\n\nFlames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever.\n\n\u201cOff you go then, Fred,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cComing,\u201d said Fred. \u201cOh no \u2014 hang on \u2014\u201d\n\nA bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred\u2019s pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction \u2014 big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers.\n\nFred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying \u201cthe Burrow!\u201d Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp. There was a whooshing sound, and Fred vanished.\n\n\u201cRight then, George,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, \u201cyou and the trunk.\u201d\n\nHarry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better. Then, with a second whoosh, George had cried \u201cthe Burrow!\u201d and vanished too.\n\n\u201cRon, you next,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cSee you,\u201d said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted \u201cthe Burrow!\u201d and disappeared.\n\nNow Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.\n\n\u201cWell . . .\u2019bye then,\u201d Harry said to the Dursleys.\n\nThey didn\u2019t say anything at all. Harry moved toward the fire, but just as he reached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a hand and held him back. He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement.\n\n\u201cHarry said good-bye to you,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear him?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to see your nephew till next summer,\u201d he said to Uncle Vernon in mild indignation. \u201cSurely you\u2019re going to say good-bye?\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s face worked furiously. The idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley\u2019s wand was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon\u2019s tiny eyes darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully, \u201cGood-bye, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you,\u201d said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment, however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to scream.\n\nHarry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents. He was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second later, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley\u2019s tongue \u2014 and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him.\n\nAunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to shout to make himself heard.\n\n\u201cNot to worry, I can sort him out!\u201d he yelled, advancing on Dudley with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cNo, really!\u201d said Mr. Weasley desperately. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple process \u2014 it was the toffee \u2014 my son Fred \u2014 real practical joker \u2014 but it\u2019s only an Engorgement Charm \u2014 at least, I think it is \u2014 please, I can correct it \u2014\u201d\n\nBut far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic-stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley\u2019s tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.\n\n\u201cNow really!\u201d said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help!\u201d\n\nBellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament.\n\n\u201cHarry, go! Just go!\u201d Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle Vernon. \u201cI\u2019ll sort this out!\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon\u2019s second ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to Mr. Weasley. He stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as he said \u201cthe Burrow!\u201d His last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon\u2019s hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley\u2019s tongue lolling around like a great slimy python. But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys\u2019 living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green flames."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter5": "WEASLEYS\u2019 WIZARD WHEEZES\n\n\n\n\nHarry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then, when at last he felt himself slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys\u2019 kitchen fire.\n\n\u201cDid he eat it?\u201d said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his feet.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, straightening up. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTon-Tongue Toffee,\u201d said Fred brightly. \u201cGeorge and I invented them, and we\u2019ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer. . . .\u201d\n\nThe tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two red-haired people Harry had never seen before, though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie, the two eldest Weasley brothers.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re you doing, Harry?\u201d said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.\n\nBill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry\u2019s hand. Bill came as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for the Wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around. However, Bill was \u2014 there was no other word for it \u2014 cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. Bill\u2019s clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide.\n\nBefore any of them could say anything else, there was a faint popping noise, and Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at George\u2019s shoulder. He was looking angrier than Harry had ever seen him.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny, Fred!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat on earth did you give that Muggle boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t give him anything,\u201d said Fred, with another evil grin. \u201cI just dropped it. . . . It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told him to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dropped it on purpose!\u201d roared Mr. Weasley. \u201cYou knew he\u2019d eat it, you knew he was on a diet \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow big did his tongue get?\u201d George asked eagerly.\n\n\u201cIt was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it!\u201d\n\nHarry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t funny!\u201d Mr. Weasley shouted. \u201cThat sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard\u2013Muggle relations! I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own sons \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to him because he\u2019s a Muggle!\u201d said Fred indignantly.\n\n\u201cNo, we gave it to him because he\u2019s a great bullying git,\u201d said George. \u201cIsn\u2019t he, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,\u201d said Harry earnestly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point!\u201d raged Mr. Weasley. \u201cYou wait until I tell your mother \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me what?\u201d said a voice behind them.\n\nMrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short, plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion.\n\n\u201cOh hello, Harry, dear,\u201d she said, spotting him and smiling. Then her eyes snapped back to her husband. \u201cTell me what, Arthur?\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he was with Fred and George, he hadn\u2019t really intended to tell Mrs. Weasley what had happened. There was a silence, while Mr. Weasley eyed his wife nervously. Then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry\u2019s and Ron\u2019s friend, Hermione Granger. The other, who was small and red-haired, was Ron\u2019s younger sister, Ginny. Both of them smiled at Harry, who grinned back, which made Ginny go scarlet \u2014 she had been very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the Burrow.\n\n\u201cTell me what, Arthur?\u201d Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous sort of voice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Molly,\u201d mumbled Mr. Weasley, \u201cFred and George just \u2014 but I\u2019ve had words with them \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have they done this time?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cIf it\u2019s got anything to do with Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you show Harry where he\u2019s sleeping, Ron?\u201d said Hermione from the doorway.\n\n\u201cHe knows where he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d said Ron, \u201cin my room, he slept there last \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can all go,\u201d said Hermione pointedly.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Ron, cottoning on. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll come too,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cYou stay where you are!\u201d snarled Mrs. Weasley.\n\nHarry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione, and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.\n\n\u201cWhat are Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes?\u201d Harry asked as they climbed.\n\nRon and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George\u2019s room,\u201d said Ron quietly. \u201cGreat long price lists for stuff they\u2019ve invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they\u2019d been inventing all that . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but we never thought they were actually making things,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cWe thought they just liked the noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly, most of the stuff \u2014 well, all of it, really \u2014 was a bit dangerous,\u201d said Ron, \u201cand, you know, they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. Told them they weren\u2019t allowed to make any more of it, and burned all the order forms. . . . She\u2019s furious at them anyway. They didn\u2019t get as many O.W.L.s as she expected.\u201d\n\nO.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations Hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen.\n\n\u201cAnd then there was this big row,\u201d Ginny said, \u201cbecause Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop.\u201d\n\nJust then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.\n\n\u201cHi, Percy,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOh hello, Harry,\u201d said Percy. \u201cI was wondering who was making all the noise. I\u2019m trying to work in here, you know \u2014 I\u2019ve got a report to finish for the office \u2014 and it\u2019s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not thundering,\u201d said Ron irritably. \u201cWe\u2019re walking. Sorry if we\u2019ve disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cA report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,\u201d said Percy smugly. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin \u2014 leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll change the world, that report will,\u201d said Ron. \u201cFront page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.\u201d\n\nPercy went slightly pink.\n\n\u201cYou might sneer, Ron,\u201d he said heatedly, \u201cbut unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, all right,\u201d said Ron, and he started off upstairs again. Percy slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them. It sounded as though Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees.\n\nThe room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron\u2019s favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog. Ron\u2019s old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron\u2019s letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly.\n\n\u201cShut up, Pig,\u201d said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room. \u201cFred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,\u201d he told Harry. \u201cPercy gets to keep his room all to himself because he\u2019s got to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 why are you calling that owl Pig?\u201d Harry asked Ron.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s being stupid,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cIts proper name is Pigwidgeon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s not a stupid name at all,\u201d said Ron sarcastically. \u201cGinny named him,\u201d he explained to Harry. \u201cShe reckons it\u2019s sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won\u2019t answer to anything else. So now he\u2019s Pig. I\u2019ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to that.\u201d\n\nPigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly. Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously. He had moaned continually about his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione\u2019s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Crookshanks?\u201d Harry asked Hermione now.\n\n\u201cOut in the garden, I expect,\u201d she said. \u201cHe likes chasing gnomes. He\u2019s never seen any before.\u201d\n\n\u201cPercy\u2019s enjoying work, then?\u201d said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling.\n\n\u201cEnjoying it?\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cI don\u2019t reckon he\u2019d come home if Dad didn\u2019t make him. He\u2019s obsessed. Just don\u2019t get him onto the subject of his boss. According to Mr. Crouch . . . as I was saying to Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch was telling me . . . They\u2019ll be announcing their engagement any day now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you had a good summer, Harry?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cDid you get our food parcels and everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, thanks a lot,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey saved my life, those cakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd have you heard from \u2014 ?\u201d Ron began, but at a look from Hermione he fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius. Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry\u2019s godfather as he was. However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve stopped arguing,\u201d said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry. \u201cShall we go down and help your mum with dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d said Ron. The four of them left Ron\u2019s room and went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad-tempered.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re eating out in the garden,\u201d she said when they came in. \u201cThere\u2019s just not room for eleven people in here. Could you take the plates outside, girls? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables. Knives and forks, please, you two,\u201d she said to Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.\n\n\u201cOh for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping up the potatoes. \u201cThose two!\u201d she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them, I really don\u2019t. No ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can. . . .\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it. A creamy sauce poured from the wand-tip as she stirred.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as though they haven\u2019t got brains,\u201d she continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, \u201cbut they\u2019re wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they\u2019ll be in real trouble. I\u2019ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together. If they carry on the way they\u2019re going, they\u2019ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open. Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where we went wrong with them,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. \u201cIt\u2019s been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won\u2019t listen to \u2014 OH NOT AGAIN!\u201d\n\nShe had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.\n\n\u201cOne of their fake wands again!\u201d she shouted. \u201cHow many times have I told them not to leave them lying around?\u201d\n\nShe grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, \u201clet\u2019s go and help Bill and Charlie.\u201d\n\nThey left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard.\n\nThey had only gone a few paces when Hermione\u2019s bandy-legged ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs. Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other\u2019s out of the air. Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.\n\nBill\u2019s table caught Charlie\u2019s with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off. There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy\u2019s head poking out of a window on the second floor.\n\n\u201cWill you keep it down?!\u201d he bellowed.\n\n\u201cSorry, Perce,\u201d said Bill, grinning. \u201cHow\u2019re the cauldron bottoms coming on?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery badly,\u201d said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.\n\nBy seven o\u2019clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.\n\nAt the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told Mr. Crouch that I\u2019ll have it ready by Tuesday,\u201d Percy was saying pompously. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of things. I think he\u2019ll be grateful I\u2019ve done it in good time, I mean, it\u2019s extremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup. We\u2019re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Ludo Bagman \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI like Ludo,\u201d said Mr. Weasley mildly. \u201cHe was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble \u2014 a lawnmower with unnatural powers \u2014 I smoothed the whole thing over.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Bagman\u2019s likable enough, of course,\u201d said Percy dismissively, \u201cbut how he ever got to be Head of Department . . . when I compare him to Mr. Crouch! I can\u2019t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what\u2019s happened to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I was asking Ludo about that,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \u201cHe says Bertha\u2019s gotten lost plenty of times before now \u2014 though I must say, if it was someone in my department, I\u2019d be worried. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Bertha\u2019s hopeless, all right,\u201d said Percy. \u201cI hear she\u2019s been shunted from department to department for years, much more trouble than she\u2019s worth . . . but all the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her. Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her \u2014 but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania. However\u201d \u2014 Percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too. As you know, we\u2019ve got another big event to organize right after the World Cup.\u201d\n\nPercy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting. \u201cYou know the one I\u2019m talking about, Father.\u201d He raised his voice slightly. \u201cThe top-secret one.\u201d\n\nRon rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, \u201cHe\u2019s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work. Probably an exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition.\n\n\u201c. . . with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they say at the bank?\u201d\n\n\u201cMum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure,\u201d said Bill patiently.\n\n\u201cAnd your hair\u2019s getting silly, dear,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, fingering her wand lovingly. \u201cI wish you\u2019d let me give it a trim. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI like it,\u201d said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. \u201cYou\u2019re so old-fashioned, Mum. Anyway, it\u2019s nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore\u2019s. . . .\u201d\n\nNext to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking spiritedly about the World Cup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be Ireland,\u201d said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful of potato. \u201cThey flattened Peru in the semifinals.\u201d\n\n\u201cBulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cKrum\u2019s one decent player, Ireland has got seven,\u201d said Charlie shortly. \u201cI wish England had got through. That was embarrassing, that was.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever his isolation from the Wizarding world when he was stuck on Privet Drive.\n\n\u201cWent down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,\u201d said Charlie gloomily. \u201cShocking performance. And Wales lost to Uganda, and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg.\u201d\n\nHarry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a Firebolt. Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the magical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.\n\nMr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.\n\nRon looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry, \u201cSo \u2014 have you heard from Sirius lately?\u201d\n\nHermione looked around, listening closely.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry softly, \u201ctwice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him yesterday. He might write back while I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nHe suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius, and for a moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken him . . . but he really didn\u2019t want to worry them just now, not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.\n\n\u201cLook at the time,\u201d Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch. \u201cYou really should be in bed, the whole lot of you \u2014 you\u2019ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you leave your school list out, I\u2019ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley. I\u2019m getting everyone else\u2019s. There might not be time after the World Cup, the match went on for five days last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow \u2014 hope it does this time!\u201d said Harry enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cWell, I certainly don\u2019t,\u201d said Percy sanctimoniously. \u201cI shudder to think what the state of my in-tray would be if I was away from work for five days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cThat was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!\u201d said Percy, going very red in the face. \u201cIt was nothing personal!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was,\u201d Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table. \u201cWe sent it.\u201d"}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter6": "THE PORTKEY\n\n\n\n\nHarry felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep in Ron\u2019s room when he was being shaken awake by Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cTime to go, Harry, dear,\u201d she whispered, moving away to wake Ron.\n\nHarry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and sat up. It was still dark outside. Ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him. At the foot of Harry\u2019s mattress he saw two large, disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets.\n\n\u201c\u2019S\u2019 time already?\u201d said Fred groggily.\n\nThey dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then, yawning and stretching, the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen.\n\nMrs. Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove, while Mr. Weasley was sitting at the table, checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets. He looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly. He was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think?\u201d he asked anxiously. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to go incognito \u2014 do I look like a Muggle, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, smiling, \u201cvery good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?\u201d said George, failing to stifle a huge yawn.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re Apparating, aren\u2019t they?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls. \u201cSo they can have a bit of a lie-in.\u201d\n\nHarry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another, but had never known any Hogwarts student to do it, and understood that it was very difficult.\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re still in bed?\u201d said Fred grumpily, pulling his bowl of porridge toward him. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we Apparate too?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re not of age and you haven\u2019t passed your test,\u201d snapped Mrs. Weasley. \u201cAnd where have those girls got to?\u201d\n\nShe bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs.\n\n\u201cYou have to pass a test to Apparate?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans. \u201cThe Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a license. It\u2019s not easy, Apparition, and when it\u2019s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications. This pair I\u2019m talking about went and Splinched themselves.\u201d\n\nEveryone around the table except Harry winced.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 Splinched?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThey left half of themselves behind,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, now spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge. \u201cSo, of course, they were stuck. Couldn\u2019t move either way. Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out. Meant a fair old bit of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they\u2019d left behind. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of Privet Drive.\n\n\u201cWere they okay?\u201d he asked, startled.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Mr. Weasley matter-of-factly. \u201cBut they got a heavy fine, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be trying it again in a hurry. You don\u2019t mess around with Apparition. There are plenty of adult wizards who don\u2019t bother with it. Prefer brooms \u2014 slower, but safer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlie had to take the test twice,\u201d said Fred, grinning. \u201cHe failed the first time, Apparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, well, he passed the second time,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers.\n\n\u201cPercy only passed two weeks ago,\u201d said George. \u201cHe\u2019s been Apparating downstairs every morning since, just to prove he can.\u201d\n\nThere were footsteps down the passageway and Hermione and Ginny came into the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.\n\n\u201cWhy do we have to be up so early?\u201d Ginny said, rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of a walk,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cWalk?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat, are we walking to the World Cup?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s miles away,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, smiling. \u201cWe only need to walk a short way. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorge!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all jumped.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said George, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody.\n\n\u201cWhat is that in your pocket?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you lie to me!\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George\u2019s pocket and said, \u201cAccio!\u201d\n\nSeveral small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of George\u2019s pocket; he made a grab for them but missed, and they sped right into Mrs. Weasley\u2019s outstretched hand.\n\n\u201cWe told you to destroy them!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley furiously, holding up what were unmistakably more Ton-Tongue Toffees. \u201cWe told you to get rid of the lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!\u201d\n\nIt was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed to find them all.\n\n\u201cAccio! Accio! Accio!\u201d she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places, including the lining of George\u2019s jacket and the turn-ups of Fred\u2019s jeans.\n\n\u201cWe spent six months developing those!\u201d Fred shouted at his mother as she threw the toffees away.\n\n\u201cOh a fine way to spend six months!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cNo wonder you didn\u2019t get more O.W.L.s!\u201d\n\nAll in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure. Mrs. Weasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr. Weasley on the cheek, though not nearly as much as the twins, who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her.\n\n\u201cWell, have a lovely time,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, \u201cand behave yourselves,\u201d she called after the twins\u2019 retreating backs, but they did not look back or answer. \u201cI\u2019ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday,\u201d Mrs. Weasley said to Mr. Weasley, as he, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across the dark yard after Fred and George.\n\nIt was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull, greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer. Harry, having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the Quidditch World Cup, sped up to walk with Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cSo how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a massive organizational problem,\u201d sighed Mr. Weasley. \u201cThe trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven\u2019t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. There are places Muggles can\u2019t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry\u2019s been working on it for months. First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can\u2019t have too many clogging up their buses and trains \u2014 remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there\u2019s a handy wood they\u2019re using as the Apparition point. For those who don\u2019t want to Apparate, or can\u2019t, we use Portkeys. They\u2019re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do large groups at a time if you need to. There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose beyond the village of Ottery St. Catchpole.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of objects are Portkeys?\u201d said Harry curiously.\n\n\u201cWell, they can be anything,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cUnobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don\u2019t go picking them up and playing with them . . . stuff they\u2019ll just think is litter. . . .\u201d\n\nThey trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the village, the silence broken only by their footsteps. The sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village, its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue. Harry\u2019s hands and feet were freezing. Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb Stoatshead Hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick black tuffets of grass. Each breath Harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up when, at last, his feet found level ground.\n\n\u201cWhew,\u201d panted Mr. Weasley, taking off his glasses and wiping them on his sweater. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve made good time \u2014 we\u2019ve got ten minutes. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione came over the crest of the hill last, clutching a stitch in her side.\n\n\u201cNow we just need the Portkey,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground. \u201cIt won\u2019t be big. . . . Come on . . .\u201d\n\nThey spread out, searching. They had only been at it for a couple of minutes, however, when a shout rent the still air.\n\n\u201cOver here, Arthur! Over here, son, we\u2019ve got it!\u201d\n\nTwo tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltop.\n\n\u201cAmos!\u201d said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted. The rest of them followed.\n\nMr. Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy-faced wizard with a scrubby brown beard, who was holding a moldy-looking old boot in his other hand.\n\n\u201cThis is Amos Diggory, everyone,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cHe works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And I think you know his son, Cedric?\u201d\n\nCedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Cedric, looking around at them all.\n\nEverybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.\n\n\u201cLong walk, Arthur?\u201d Cedric\u2019s father asked.\n\n\u201cNot too bad,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cWe live just on the other side of the village there. You?\u201d\n\n\u201cHad to get up at two, didn\u2019t we, Ced? I tell you, I\u2019ll be glad when he\u2019s got his Apparition test. Still . . . not complaining . . . Quidditch World Cup, wouldn\u2019t miss it for a sackful of Galleons \u2014 and the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I got off easy. . . .\u201d Amos Diggory peered good-naturedly around at the three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny. \u201cAll these yours, Arthur?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, only the redheads,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children. \u201cThis is Hermione, friend of Ron\u2019s \u2014 and Harry, another friend \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s beard,\u201d said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. \u201cHarry? Harry Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHarry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cCed\u2019s talked about you, of course,\u201d said Amos Diggory. \u201cTold us all about playing against you last year. . . . I said to him, I said \u2014 Ced, that\u2019ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will. . . . You beat Harry Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.\n\n\u201cHarry fell off his broom, Dad,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI told you . . . it was an accident. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but you didn\u2019t fall off, did you?\u201d roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back. \u201cAlways modest, our Ced, always the gentleman . . . but the best man won, I\u2019m sure Harry\u2019d say the same, wouldn\u2019t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don\u2019t need to be a genius to tell which one\u2019s the better flier!\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be nearly time,\u201d said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his watch again. \u201cDo you know whether we\u2019re waiting for any more, Amos?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts couldn\u2019t get tickets,\u201d said Mr. Diggory. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any more of us in this area, are there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a minute off. . . . We\u2019d better get ready. . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked around at Harry and Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou just need to touch the Portkey, that\u2019s all, a finger will do \u2014\u201d\n\nWith difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by Amos Diggory.\n\nThey all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop. Nobody spoke. It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd this would look if a Muggle were to walk up here now . . . nine people, two of them grown men, clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness, waiting. . . .\n\n\u201cThree . . .\u201d muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his watch, \u201ctwo . . . one . . .\u201d\n\nIt happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. His feet left the ground; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then \u2014\n\nHis feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud.\n\nHarry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were still standing, though looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground.\n\n\u201cSeven past five from Stoatshead Hill,\u201d said a voice."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter7": "BAGMAN AND CROUCH\n\n\n\n\nHarry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet. They had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor. In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy-looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.\n\n\u201cMorning, Basil,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.\n\n\u201cHello there, Arthur,\u201d said Basil wearily. \u201cNot on duty, eh? It\u2019s all right for some. . . . We\u2019ve been here all night. . . . You\u2019d better get out of the way, we\u2019ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five-fifteen. Hang on, I\u2019ll find your campsite. . . . Weasley . . . Weasley . . .\u201d He consulted his parchment list. \u201cAbout a quarter of a mile\u2019s walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager\u2019s called Mr. Roberts. Diggory . . . second field . . . ask for Mr. Payne.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Basil,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow him.\n\nThey set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the mist. After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good-bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door.\n\nA man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents. Harry knew at a glance that this was the only real Muggle for several acres. When he heard their footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.\n\n\u201cMorning!\u201d said Mr. Weasley brightly.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said the Muggle.\n\n\u201cWould you be Mr. Roberts?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, I would,\u201d said Mr. Roberts. \u201cAnd who\u2019re you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWeasley \u2014 two tents, booked a couple of days ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, consulting a list tacked to the door. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a space up by the wood there. Just the one night?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be paying now, then?\u201d said Mr. Roberts.\n\n\u201cAh \u2014 right \u2014 certainly \u2014\u201d said Mr. Weasley. He retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned Harry toward him. \u201cHelp me, Harry,\u201d he muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart. \u201cThis one\u2019s a \u2014 a \u2014 a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number on it now. . . . So this is a five?\u201d\n\n\u201cA twenty,\u201d Harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of Mr. Roberts trying to catch every word.\n\n\u201cAh yes, so it is. . . . I don\u2019t know, these little bits of paper . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou foreign?\u201d said Mr. Roberts as Mr. Weasley returned with the correct notes.\n\n\u201cForeign?\u201d repeated Mr. Weasley, puzzled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the first one who\u2019s had trouble with money,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, scrutinizing Mr. Weasley closely. \u201cI had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you really?\u201d said Mr. Weasley nervously.\n\nMr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change.\n\n\u201cNever been this crowded,\u201d he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field again. \u201cHundreds of pre-bookings. People usually just turn up. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that right?\u201d said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out for his change, but Mr. Roberts didn\u2019t give it to him.\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cPeople from all over. Loads of foreigners. And not just foreigners. Weirdos, you know? There\u2019s a bloke walking \u2019round in a kilt and a poncho.\u201d\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t he?\u201d said Mr. Weasley anxiously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like some sort of . . . I dunno . . . like some sort of rally,\u201d said Mr. Roberts. \u201cThey all seem to know each other. Like a big party.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr. Roberts\u2019s front door.\n\n\u201cObliviate!\u201d he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr. Roberts.\n\nInstantly, Mr. Roberts\u2019s eyes slid out of focus, his brows unknitted, and a look of dreamy unconcern fell over his face. Harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified.\n\n\u201cA map of the campsite for you,\u201d Mr. Roberts said placidly to Mr. Weasley. \u201cAnd your change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks very much,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\nThe wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite. He looked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr. Weasley, \u201cBeen having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman\u2019s not helping. Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a worry about anti-Muggle security. Blimey, I\u2019ll be glad when this is over. See you later, Arthur.\u201d\n\nHe Disapparated.\n\n\u201cI thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports,\u201d said Ginny, looking surprised. \u201cHe should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles, shouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates into the campsite, \u201cbut Ludo\u2019s always been a bit . . . well . . . lax about security. You couldn\u2019t wish for a more enthusiastic Head of the sports department though. He played Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.\u201d\n\nThey trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes. However, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious. Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial, and fountain.\n\n\u201cAlways the same,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, smiling. \u201cWe can\u2019t resist showing off when we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us.\u201d\n\nThey had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read WEEZLY.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have a better spot!\u201d said Mr. Weasley happily. \u201cThe field is just on the other side of the wood there, we\u2019re as close as we could be.\u201d He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders. \u201cRight,\u201d he said excitedly, \u201cno magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we\u2019re out in these numbers on Muggle land. We\u2019ll be putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. . . . Muggles do it all the time. . . . Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?\u201d\n\nHarry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old neighbor. However, he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents.\n\nAll of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be a bit cramped,\u201d he called, \u201cbut I think we\u2019ll all squeeze in. Come and have a look.\u201d\n\nHarry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop. He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three-room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs. Figg\u2019s house: There were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not for long,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom. \u201cI borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn\u2019t camp much anymore, poor fellow, he\u2019s got lumbago.\u201d\n\nHe picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it. \u201cWe\u2019ll need water. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us,\u201d said Ron, who had followed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions. \u201cIt\u2019s on the other side of the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you, Harry, and Hermione go and get us some water then\u201d \u2014 Mr. Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans \u2014 \u201cand the rest of us will get some wood for a fire?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got an oven,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, anti-Muggle security!\u201d said Mr. Weasley, his face shining with anticipation. \u201cWhen real Muggles camp, they cook on fires outdoors. I\u2019ve seen them at it!\u201d\n\nAfter a quick tour of the girls\u2019 tent, which was slightly smaller than the boys\u2019, though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans.\n\nNow, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction. They made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around. It was only just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about those in other countries.\n\nTheir fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid-shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.\n\n\u201cHow many times, Kevin? You don\u2019t \u2014 touch \u2014 Daddy\u2019s \u2014 wand \u2014 yecchh!\u201d\n\nShe had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy\u2019s yells \u2014 \u201cYou bust slug! You bust slug!\u201d\n\nA short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls\u2019 toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly, \u201cIn broad daylight! Parents having a lie-in, I suppose \u2014\u201d\n\nHere and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn\u2019t work. Three African wizards sat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged American witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read: THE SALEM WITCHES\u2019 INSTITUTE. Harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though he couldn\u2019t understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?\u201d said Ron.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Ron\u2019s eyes. They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth. Grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they heard their names.\n\n\u201cHarry! Ron! Hermione!\u201d\n\nIt was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth year. He was sitting in front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cLike the decorations?\u201d said Seamus, grinning. \u201cThe Ministry\u2019s not too happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, why shouldn\u2019t we show our colors?\u201d said Mrs. Finnigan. \u201cYou should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents. You\u2019ll be supporting Ireland, of course?\u201d she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione beadily. When they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off again, though, as Ron said, \u201cLike we\u2019d say anything else surrounded by that lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look,\u201d said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upfield, where the Bulgarian flag \u2014 white, green, and red \u2014 was fluttering in the breeze.\n\nThe tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows. The picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl.\n\n\u201cKrum,\u201d said Ron quietly.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cKrum!\u201d said Ron. \u201cViktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks really grumpy,\u201d said Hermione, looking around at the many Krums blinking and scowling at them.\n\n\u201c\u2018Really grumpy\u2019?\u201d Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. \u201cWho cares what he looks like? He\u2019s unbelievable. He\u2019s really young too. Only just eighteen or something. He\u2019s a genius, you wait until tonight, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThere was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.\n\n\u201cJust put them on, Archie, there\u2019s a good chap. You can\u2019t walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate\u2019s already getting suspicious \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI bought this in a Muggle shop,\u201d said the old wizard stubbornly. \u201cMuggles wear them.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,\u201d said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not putting them on,\u201d said old Archie in indignation. \u201cI like a healthy breeze \u2019round my privates, thanks.\u201d\n\nHermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.\n\nWalking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite. Here and there, they saw more familiar faces: other Hogwarts students with their families. Oliver Wood, the old Captain of Harry\u2019s House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to his parents\u2019 tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Next they were hailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year, and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team. She waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back. More to stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before.\n\n\u201cWho d\u2019you reckon they are?\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t go to Hogwarts, do they?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Spect they go to some foreign school,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI know there are others. Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil . . . this was years and years ago . . . and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn\u2019t afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn\u2019t going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up.\u201d\n\nHarry laughed but didn\u2019t voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other Wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn\u2019t be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news about other Wizarding schools in some book or other.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been ages,\u201d said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys\u2019 tents.\n\n\u201cMet a few people,\u201d said Ron, setting the water down. \u201cYou not got that fire started yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cDad\u2019s having fun with the matches,\u201d said Fred.\n\nMr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground around him, but he looked as though he was having the time of his life.\n\n\u201cOops!\u201d he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise.\n\n\u201cCome here, Mr. Weasley,\u201d said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him, and showing him how to do it properly.\n\nAt last they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything. There was plenty to watch while they waited, however. Their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field, and Ministry members kept hurrying up and down it, greeting Mr. Weasley cordially as they passed. Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for Harry\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s benefit; his own children knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested.\n\n\u201cThat was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin Liaison Office. . . . Here comes Gilbert Wimple; he\u2019s with the Committee on Experimental Charms; he\u2019s had those horns for a while now. . . . Hello, Arnie . . . Arnold Peasegood, he\u2019s an Obliviator \u2014 member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, you know. . . . and that\u2019s Bode and Croaker . . . they\u2019re Unspeakables. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the Department of Mysteries, top secret, no idea what they get up to. . . .\u201d\n\nAt last, the fire was ready, and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when Bill, Charlie, and Percy came strolling out of the woods toward them.\n\n\u201cJust Apparated, Dad,\u201d said Percy loudly. \u201cAh, excellent, lunch!\u201d\n\nThey were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when Mr. Weasley jumped to his feet, waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them. \u201cAha!\u201d he said. \u201cThe man of the moment! Ludo!\u201d\n\nLudo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had seen so far, even including old Archie in his flowered nightdress. He was wearing long Quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black. An enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest. He had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed; the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played Quidditch for England. His nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy.\n\n\u201cAhoy there!\u201d Bagman called happily. He was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement.\n\n\u201cArthur, old man,\u201d he puffed as he reached the campfire, \u201cwhat a day, eh? What a day! Could we have asked for more perfect weather? A cloudless night coming . . . and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements. . . . Not much for me to do!\u201d\n\nBehind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry wizards rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air.\n\nPercy hurried forward with his hand outstretched. Apparently his disapproval of the way Ludo Bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression.\n\n\u201cAh \u2014 yes,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, grinning, \u201cthis is my son Percy. He\u2019s just started at the Ministry \u2014 and this is Fred \u2014 no, George, sorry \u2014 that\u2019s Fred \u2014 Bill, Charlie, Ron \u2014 my daughter, Ginny \u2014 and Ron\u2019s friends, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter.\u201d\n\nBagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry\u2019s name, and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d Mr. Weasley continued, \u201cthis is Ludo Bagman, you know who he is, it\u2019s thanks to him we\u2019ve got such good tickets \u2014\u201d\n\nBagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing.\n\n\u201cFancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?\u201d he said eagerly, jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellow-and-black robes. \u201cI\u2019ve already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first \u2014 I offered him nice odds, considering Ireland\u2019s front three are the strongest I\u2019ve seen in years \u2014 and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a week-long match.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . go on then,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cLet\u2019s see . . . a Galleon on Ireland to win?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Galleon?\u201d Ludo Bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered himself. \u201cVery well, very well . . . any other takers?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a bit young to be gambling,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cMolly wouldn\u2019t like \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,\u201d said Fred as he and George quickly pooled all their money, \u201cthat Ireland wins \u2014 but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch. Oh and we\u2019ll throw in a fake wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that \u2014\u201d Percy hissed, but Bagman didn\u2019t seem to think the wand was rubbish at all; on the contrary, his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared with laughter.\n\n\u201cExcellent! I haven\u2019t seen one that convincing in years! I\u2019d pay five Galleons for that!\u201d\n\nPercy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d said Mr. Weasley under his breath, \u201cI don\u2019t want you betting. . . . That\u2019s all your savings. . . . Your mother \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a spoilsport, Arthur!\u201d boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling his pockets excitedly. \u201cThey\u2019re old enough to know what they want! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum\u2019ll get the Snitch? Not a chance, boys, not a chance. . . . I\u2019ll give you excellent odds on that one. . . . We\u2019ll add five Galleons for the funny wand, then, shall we. . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins\u2019 names.\n\n\u201cCheers,\u201d said George, taking the slip of parchment Bagman handed him and tucking it away carefully. Bagman turned most cheerfully back to Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t do me a brew, I suppose? I\u2019m keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch. My Bulgarian opposite number\u2019s making difficulties, and I can\u2019t understand a word he\u2019s saying. Barty\u2019ll be able to sort it out. He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Crouch?\u201d said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing with excitement. \u201cHe speaks over two hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone can speak Troll,\u201d said Fred dismissively. \u201cAll you have to do is point and grunt.\u201d\n\nPercy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil.\n\n\u201cAny news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?\u201d Mr. Weasley asked as Bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all.\n\n\u201cNot a dicky bird,\u201d said Bagman comfortably. \u201cBut she\u2019ll turn up. Poor old Bertha . . . memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction. Lost, you take my word for it. She\u2019ll wander back into the office sometime in October, thinking it\u2019s still July.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think it might be time to send someone to look for her?\u201d Mr. Weasley suggested tentatively as Percy handed Bagman his tea.\n\n\u201cBarty Crouch keeps saying that,\u201d said Bagman, his round eyes widening innocently, \u201cbut we really can\u2019t spare anyone at the moment. Oh \u2014 talk of the devil! Barty!\u201d\n\nA wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he could not have made more of a contrast with Ludo Bagman, sprawled on the grass in his old Wasp robes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule. His shoes were very highly polished. Harry could see at once why Percy idolized him. Percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him for what he really was.\n\n\u201cPull up a bit of grass, Barty,\u201d said Ludo brightly, patting the ground beside him.\n\n\u201cNo thank you, Ludo,\u201d said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere. The Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top Box.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh is that what they\u2019re after?\u201d said Bagman. \u201cI thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong accent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Crouch!\u201d said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of half-bow that made him look like a hunchback. \u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise. \u201cYes \u2014 thank you, Weatherby.\u201d\n\nFred and George choked into their own cups. Percy, very pink around the ears, busied himself with the kettle.\n\n\u201cOh and I\u2019ve been wanting a word with you too, Arthur,\u201d said Mr. Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon Mr. Weasley. \u201cAli Bashir\u2019s on the warpath. He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets.\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.\n\n\u201cI sent him an owl about that just last week. If I\u2019ve told him once I\u2019ve told him a hundred times: Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he listen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy. \u201cHe\u2019s desperate to export here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019ll never replace brooms in Britain, will they?\u201d said Bagman.\n\n\u201cAli thinks there\u2019s a niche in the market for a family vehicle,\u201d said Mr. Crouch. \u201cI remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve \u2014 but that was before carpets were banned, of course.\u201d\n\nHe spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law.\n\n\u201cSo, been keeping busy, Barty?\u201d said Bagman breezily.\n\n\u201cFairly,\u201d said Mr. Crouch dryly. \u201cOrganizing Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat, Ludo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect you\u2019ll both be glad when this is over?\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\nLudo Bagman looked shocked.\n\n\u201cGlad! Don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve had more fun. . . . Still, it\u2019s not as though we haven\u2019t got anything to look forward to, eh, Barty? Eh? Plenty left to organize, eh?\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman.\n\n\u201cWe agreed not to make the announcement until all the details \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh details!\u201d said Bagman, waving the word away like a cloud of midges. \u201cThey\u2019ve signed, haven\u2019t they? They\u2019ve agreed, haven\u2019t they? I bet you anything these kids\u2019ll know soon enough anyway. I mean, it\u2019s happening at Hogwarts \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLudo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know,\u201d said Mr. Crouch sharply, cutting Bagman\u2019s remarks short. \u201cThank you for the tea, Weatherby.\u201d\n\nHe pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to rise; Bagman struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea, the gold in his pockets chinking merrily.\n\n\u201cSee you all later!\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be up in the Top Box with me \u2014 I\u2019m commentating!\u201d He waved, Barty Crouch nodded curtly, and both of them Disapparated.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening at Hogwarts, Dad?\u201d said Fred at once. \u201cWhat were they talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, smiling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it,\u201d said Percy stiffly. \u201cMr. Crouch was quite right not to disclose it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh shut up, Weatherby,\u201d said Fred.\n\nA sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on. By dusk, the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last vestiges of pretense disappeared: The Ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere.\n\nSalesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes \u2014 green for Ireland, red for Bulgaria \u2014 which were squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared, flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.\n\n\u201cBeen saving my pocket money all summer for this,\u201d Ron told Harry as they and Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying souvenirs. Though Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum walked backward and forward over Ron\u2019s hand, scowling up at the green rosette above him.\n\n\u201cWow, look at these!\u201d said Harry, hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars, except that they were covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dials.\n\n\u201cOmnioculars,\u201d said the saleswizard eagerly. \u201cYou can replay action . . . slow everything down . . . and they flash up a play-by-play breakdown if you need it. Bargain \u2014 ten Galleons each.\u201d\n\n\u201cWish I hadn\u2019t bought this now,\u201d said Ron, gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the Omnioculars.\n\n\u201cThree pairs,\u201d said Harry firmly to the wizard.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 don\u2019t bother,\u201d said Ron, going red. He was always touchy about the fact that Harry, who had inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much more money than he did.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be getting anything for Christmas,\u201d Harry told him, thrusting Omnioculars into his and Hermione\u2019s hands. \u201cFor about ten years, mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d said Ron, grinning.\n\n\u201cOooh, thanks, Harry,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll get us some programs, look \u2014\u201d\n\nTheir money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the tents. Bill, Charlie, and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too, and Mr. Weasley was carrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had no souvenirs as they had given Bagman all their gold.\n\nAnd then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods, and at once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees, lighting a path to the field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time!\u201d said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any of them. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go!\u201d"}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter8": "THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP\n\n\n\n\nClutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn\u2019t stop grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.\n\n\u201cSeats a hundred thousand,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cMinistry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they\u2019ve suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again . . . bless them,\u201d he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.\n\n\u201cPrime seats!\u201d said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets. \u201cTop Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.\u201d\n\nThe stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered upward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley\u2019s party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goalposts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined.\n\nA hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry\u2019s eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant\u2019s hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field.\n\nThe Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family \u2014 Safe, Reliable, and with Built-in Anti-Burglar Buzzer . . . Mrs. Skower\u2019s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No Pain, No Stain! . . . Gladrags Wizardwear \u2014 London, Paris, Hogsmeade . . .\n\nHarry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . .\n\n\u201cDobby?\u201d said Harry incredulously.\n\nThe tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn\u2019t Dobby \u2014 it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry\u2019s friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family.\n\n\u201cDid sir just call me Dobby?\u201d squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby\u2019s had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected \u2014 though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf \u2014 that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry told the elf, \u201cI just thought you were someone I knew.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I knows Dobby too, sir!\u201d squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. \u201cMy name is Winky, sir \u2014 and you, sir \u2014\u201d Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry\u2019s scar. \u201cYou is surely Harry Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I am,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!\u201d she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck.\n\n\u201cHow is he?\u201d said Harry. \u201cHow\u2019s freedom suiting him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, sir,\u201d said Winky, shaking her head, \u201cah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry, taken aback. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom is going to Dobby\u2019s head, sir,\u201d said Winky sadly. \u201cIdeas above his station, sir. Can\u2019t get another position, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Harry.\n\nWinky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, \u201cHe is wanting paying for his work, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaying?\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cWell \u2014 why shouldn\u2019t he be paid?\u201d\n\nWinky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden again.\n\n\u201cHouse-elves is not paid, sir!\u201d she said in a muffled squeak. \u201cNo, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you\u2019s up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s about time he had a bit of fun,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHouse-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,\u201d said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. \u201cHouse-elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter\u201d \u2014 she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped \u2014 \u201cbut my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s he sent you up here, if he knows you don\u2019t like heights?\u201d said Harry, frowning.\n\n\u201cMaster \u2014 master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very busy,\u201d said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her. \u201cWinky is wishing she is back in master\u2019s tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.\u201d\n\nShe gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again. Harry turned back to the others.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s a house-elf?\u201d Ron muttered. \u201cWeird things, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby was weirder,\u201d said Harry fervently.\n\nRon pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium.\n\n\u201cWild!\u201d he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. \u201cI can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again . . . and again . . . and again . . .\u201d\n\nHermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvet-covered, tasseled program.\n\n\u201c\u2018A display from the team mascots will precede the match,\u2019\u201d she read aloud.\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s always worth watching,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cNational teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.\u201d\n\nThe box filled gradually around them over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards. Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself, arrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly embarrassed, he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend. They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry\u2019s hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, you know,\u201d he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn\u2019t seem to understand a word of English. \u201cHarry Potter . . . oh come on now, you know who he is . . . the boy who survived You-Know-Who . . . you do know who he is \u2014\u201d\n\nThe Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry\u2019s scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.\n\n\u201cKnew we\u2019d get there in the end,\u201d said Fudge wearily to Harry. \u201cI\u2019m no great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his house-elf\u2019s saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here\u2019s Lucius!\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the house-elf\u2019s former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco\u2019s mother.\n\nHarry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice-looking if she hadn\u2019t been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose.\n\n\u201cAh, Fudge,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the Minister of Magic. \u201cHow are you? I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son, Draco?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you do, how do you do?\u201d said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs. Malfoy. \u201cAnd allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk \u2014 Obalonsk \u2014 Mr. \u2014 well, he\u2019s the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can\u2019t understand a word I\u2019m saying anyway, so never mind. And let\u2019s see who else \u2014 you know Arthur Weasley, I daresay?\u201d\n\nIt was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come face-to-face: It had been in Flourish and Blotts bookshop, and they had had a fight. Mr. Malfoy\u2019s cold gray eyes swept over Mr. Weasley, and then up and down the row.\n\n\u201cGood lord, Arthur,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhat did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn\u2019t have fetched this much?\u201d\n\nFudge, who wasn\u2019t listening, said, \u201cLucius has just given a very generous contribution to St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur. He\u2019s here as my guest.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow \u2014 how nice,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, with a very strained smile.\n\nMr. Malfoy\u2019s eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr. Malfoy\u2019s lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second-class. However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy didn\u2019t dare say anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and continued down the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron, and Hermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between his mother and father.\n\n\u201cSlimy gits,\u201d Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned to face the field again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box.\n\n\u201cEveryone ready?\u201d he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam. \u201cMinister \u2014 ready to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cReady when you are, Ludo,\u201d said Fudge comfortably.\n\nLudo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said \u201cSonorus!\u201d and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen . . . welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!\u201d\n\nThe spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans \u2014 A Risk with Every Mouthful!) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.\n\n\u201cAnd now, without further ado, allow me to introduce . . . the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!\u201d\n\nThe right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval.\n\n\u201cI wonder what they\u2019ve brought,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. \u201cAaah!\u201d He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. \u201cVeela!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are veel \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry\u2019s question was answered for him. Veela were women . . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen . . . except that they weren\u2019t \u2014 they couldn\u2019t be \u2014 human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind . . . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human \u2014 in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.\n\nThe veela had started to dance, and Harry\u2019s mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. . . .\n\nAnd as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry\u2019s dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea . . . but would it be good enough?\n\n\u201cHarry, what are you doing?\u201d said Hermione\u2019s voice from a long way off.\n\nThe music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard.\n\nAngry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn\u2019t want the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be wanting that,\u201d he said, \u201conce Ireland have had their say.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field.\n\nHermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat. \u201cHonestly!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d roared Ludo Bagman\u2019s voice, \u201ckindly put your wands in the air . . . for the Irish National Team Mascots!\u201d\n\nNext moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goalposts. A rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands. Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it \u2014\n\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green.\n\n\u201cLeprechauns!\u201d said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold.\n\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry\u2019s hand, \u201cfor the Omnioculars! Now you\u2019ve got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!\u201d\n\nThe great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch the match.\n\n\u201cAnd now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome \u2014 the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you \u2014 Dimitrov!\u201d\n\nA scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian supporters.\n\n\u201cIvanova!\u201d\n\nA second scarlet-robed player zoomed out.\n\n\u201cZograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand \u2014 Krum!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him, that\u2019s him!\u201d yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own.\n\nViktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to believe he was only eighteen.\n\n\u201cAnd now, please greet \u2014 the Irish National Quidditch Team!\u201d yelled Bagman. \u201cPresenting \u2014 Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand \u2014 Lynch!\u201d\n\nSeven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word \u201cFirebolt\u201d on each of their brooms and see their names, embroidered in silver, upon their backs.\n\n\u201cAnd here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!\u201d\n\nA small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle Vernon\u2019s, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other. Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open \u2014 four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.\n\n\u201cTheeeeeeeey\u2019re OFF!\u201d screamed Bagman. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\u201d\n\nIt was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose. The speed of the players was incredible \u2014 the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.\n\nHawkshead Attacking Formation, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. Porskoff Ploy flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran\u2019s path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it \u2014\n\n\u201cTROY SCORES!\u201d roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \u201cTen zero to Ireland!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \u201cBut Levski\u2019s got the Quaffle!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, if you\u2019re not going to watch at normal speed, you\u2019re going to miss things!\u201d shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily.\n\nFurious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed.\n\nHarry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another\u2019s minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry\u2019s chest kept squeaking their names: \u201cTroy \u2014 Mullet \u2014 Moran!\u201d And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty\u2013zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters.\n\nThe match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria\u2019s first goal.\n\n\u201cFingers in your ears!\u201d bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle.\n\n\u201cDimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova \u2014 oh I say!\u201d roared Bagman.\n\nOne hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was \u2014\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to crash!\u201d screamed Hermione next to Harry.\n\nShe was half right \u2014 at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.\n\n\u201cFool!\u201d moaned Mr. Weasley. \u201cKrum was feinting!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time-out!\u201d yelled Bagman\u2019s voice, \u201cas trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be okay, he only got ploughed!\u201d Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. \u201cWhich is what Krum was after, of course. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes.\n\nHe watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. Wronski Defensive Feint \u2014 dangerous Seeker diversion read the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum\u2019s face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood \u2014 Krum hadn\u2019t seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum\u2019s face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference.\n\nLynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.\n\nAfter fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier.\n\nAs Mullet shot toward the goalposts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn\u2019t catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa\u2019s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.\n\n\u201cAnd Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing \u2014 excessive use of elbows!\u201d Bagman informed the roaring spectators. \u201cAnd \u2014 yes, it\u2019s a penalty to Ireland!\u201d\n\nThe leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words \u201cHA, HA, HA!\u201d The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again.\n\nAs one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but Hermione, who hadn\u2019t bothered, was soon tugging on Harry\u2019s arm. He turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears.\n\n\u201cLook at the referee!\u201d she said, giggling.\n\nHarry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly.\n\n\u201cNow, we can\u2019t have that!\u201d said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly amused. \u201cSomebody slap the referee!\u201d\n\nA mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous.\n\n\u201cAnd unless I\u2019m much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempting to send off the Bulgarian team mascots!\u201d said Bagman\u2019s voice. \u201cNow there\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen before. . . . Oh, this could turn nasty. . . .\u201d\n\nIt did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, landed on either side of Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating toward the leprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words \u201cHEE, HEE, HEE.\u201d Mostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians\u2019 arguments, however; he was jabbing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle.\n\n\u201cTwo penalties for Ireland!\u201d shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled with anger. \u201cAnd Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms . . . yes . . . there they go . . . and Troy takes the Quaffle . . .\u201d\n\nPlay now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.\n\n\u201cFoul!\u201d roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green.\n\n\u201cFoul!\u201d echoed Ludo Bagman\u2019s magically magnified voice. \u201cDimitrov skins Moran \u2014 deliberately flying to collide there \u2014 and it\u2019s got to be another penalty \u2014 yes, there\u2019s the whistle!\u201d\n\nThe leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn\u2019t look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders \u2014\n\n\u201cAnd that, boys,\u201d yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, \u201cis why you should never go for looks alone!\u201d\n\nMinistry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned this way and that, staring through his Omnioculars, as the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a bullet.\n\n\u201cLevski \u2014 Dimitrov \u2014 Moran \u2014 Troy \u2014 Mullet \u2014 Ivanova \u2014 Moran again \u2014 Moran \u2014 MORAN SCORES!\u201d\n\nBut the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members\u2019 wands, and the furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov \u2014\n\nThe Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in the face.\n\nThere was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum\u2019s nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn\u2019t blow his whistle. He had become distracted, and Harry couldn\u2019t blame him; one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight.\n\nHarry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even though he was supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron obviously felt the same.\n\n\u201cTime-out! Ah, come on, he can\u2019t play like that, look at him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at Lynch!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\nFor the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing. . . .\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen the Snitch!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cHe\u2019s seen it! Look at him go!\u201d\n\nHalf the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the Irish supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on . . . but Krum was on his tail. How he could see where he was going, Harry had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again \u2014\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to crash!\u201d shrieked Hermione.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not!\u201d roared Ron.\n\n\u201cLynch is!\u201d yelled Harry.\n\nAnd he was right \u2014 for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela.\n\n\u201cThe Snitch, where\u2019s the Snitch?\u201d bellowed Charlie, along the row.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got it \u2014 Krum\u2019s got it \u2014 it\u2019s all over!\u201d shouted Harry.\n\nKrum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand.\n\nThe scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn\u2019t seem to have realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as though a great jumbo jet were revving up, the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight.\n\n\u201cIRELAND WINS!\u201d Bagman shouted, who like the Irish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match. \u201cKRUM GETS THE SNITCH \u2014 BUT IRELAND WINS \u2014 good lord, I don\u2019t think any of us were expecting that!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he catch the Snitch for?\u201d Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head. \u201cHe ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knew they were never going to catch up!\u201d Harry shouted back over all the noise, also applauding loudly. \u201cThe Irish Chasers were too good. . . . He wanted to end it on his terms, that\u2019s all. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very brave, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Hermione said, leaning forward to watch Krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him. \u201cHe looks a terrible mess. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see what was happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up. His team members were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium, the Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn.\n\n\u201cVell, ve fought bravely,\u201d said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He looked around; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic.\n\n\u201cYou can speak English!\u201d said Fudge, sounding outraged. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been letting me mime everything all day!\u201d\n\n\u201cVell, it vos very funny,\u201d said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging.\n\n\u201cAnd as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!\u201d roared Bagman.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside. Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he\u2019d been using sign language all day for nothing.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers \u2014 Bulgaria!\u201d Bagman shouted.\n\nAnd up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction.\n\nOne by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum\u2019s name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.\n\nAnd then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry\u2019s hands were numb with clapping.\n\nAt last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Connolly\u2019s, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, \u201cQuietus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be talking about this one for years,\u201d he said hoarsely, \u201ca really unexpected twist, that. . . . shame it couldn\u2019t have lasted longer. . . . Ah yes. . . . yes, I owe you . . . how much?\u201d\n\nFor Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter9": "THE DARK MARK\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t tell your mother you\u2019ve been gambling,\u201d Mr. Weasley implored Fred and George as they all made their way slowly down the purple-carpeted stairs.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad,\u201d said Fred gleefully, \u201cwe\u2019ve got big plans for this money. We don\u2019t want it confiscated.\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn\u2019t want to know.\n\nThey were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites. Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in. They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny went into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks. From the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang.\n\n\u201cOh I am glad I\u2019m not on duty,\u201d muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t fancy having to go and tell the Irish they\u2019ve got to stop celebrating.\u201d\n\nHarry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum\u2019s more spectacular moves. He was itching to get back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint. . . . Somehow Oliver Wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like. . . . Harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman\u2019s voice echoed throughout the stadium, \u201cI give you . . . Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep \u2014 his fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams \u2014 all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr. Weasley was shouting.\n\n\u201cGet up! Ron \u2014 Harry \u2014 come on now, get up, this is urgent!\u201d\n\nHarry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas.\n\n\u201c\u2019S\u2019 matter?\u201d he said.\n\nDimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The noises in the campsite had changed. The singing had stopped. He could hear screams, and the sound of people running. He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, \u201cNo time, Harry \u2014 just grab a jacket and get outside \u2014 quickly!\u201d\n\nHarry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his heels.\n\nBy the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see people running away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire. Loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them; then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.\n\nA crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at them. . . . They didn\u2019t seem to have faces. . . . Then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked. High above them, floating along in midair, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air. Two of the figures were very small.\n\nMore wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies. Tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled. Once or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand. Several caught fire. The screaming grew louder.\n\nThe floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and Harry recognized one of them: Mr. Roberts, the campsite manager. The other three looked as though they might be his wife and children. One of the marchers below flipped Mrs. Roberts upside down with his wand; her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sick,\u201d Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the ground, his head flopping limply from side to side. \u201cThat is really sick. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their nightdresses, with Mr. Weasley right behind them. At the same moment, Bill, Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys\u2019 tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to help the Ministry!\u201d Mr. Weasley shouted over all the noise, rolling up his own sleeves. \u201cYou lot \u2014 get into the woods, and stick together. I\u2019ll come and fetch you when we\u2019ve sorted this out!\u201d\n\nBill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers; Mr. Weasley tore after them. Ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d said Fred, grabbing Ginny\u2019s hand and starting to pull her toward the wood. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back as they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.\n\nThe colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished. Dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air. Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see. Then he heard Ron yell with pain.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that Harry walked into her. \u201cRon, where are you? Oh this is stupid \u2014 Lumos!\u201d\n\nShe illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path. Ron was lying sprawled on the ground.\n\n\u201cTripped over a tree root,\u201d he said angrily, getting to his feet again.\n\n\u201cWell, with feet that size, hard not to,\u201d said a drawling voice from behind them.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.\n\nRon told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cLanguage, Weasley,\u201d said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering. \u201cHadn\u2019t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn\u2019t like her spotted, would you?\u201d\n\nHe nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d said Hermione defiantly.\n\n\u201cGranger, they\u2019re after Muggles,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cD\u2019you want to be showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang around . . . they\u2019re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione\u2019s a witch,\u201d Harry snarled.\n\n\u201cHave it your own way, Potter,\u201d said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. \u201cIf you think they can\u2019t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou watch your mouth!\u201d shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that \u201cMudblood\u201d was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.\n\n\u201cNever mind, Ron,\u201d said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron\u2019s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Malfoy.\n\nThere came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard. Several people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled softly.\n\n\u201cScare easily, don\u2019t they?\u201d he said lazily. \u201cI suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What\u2019s he up to \u2014 trying to rescue the Muggles?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019re your parents?\u201d said Harry, his temper rising. \u201cOut there wearing masks, are they?\u201d\n\nMalfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.\n\n\u201cWell . . . if they were, I wouldn\u2019t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, \u201clet\u2019s go and find the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep that big bushy head down, Granger,\u201d sneered Malfoy.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot!\u201d said Ron hotly.\n\n\u201cWell, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!\u201d said Hermione fervently. \u201cOh I can\u2019t believe this. Where have the others got to?\u201d\n\nFred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite. A huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path. When they saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, \u201cO\u00f9 est Madame Maxime? Nous l\u2019avons perdue \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 what?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOh . . .\u201d The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say, \u201c\u2019Ogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeauxbatons,\u201d muttered Hermione.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThey must go to Beauxbatons,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cYou know . . . Beauxbatons Academy of Magic . . . I read about it in An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . yeah . . . right,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFred and George can\u2019t have gone that far,\u201d said Ron, pulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione\u2019s, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t there. The only thing he could find was his Omnioculars.\n\n\u201cAh, no, I don\u2019t believe it . . . I\u2019ve lost my wand!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground; Harry looked all around him, but his wand was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s back in the tent,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cMaybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?\u201d Hermione suggested anxiously.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cmaybe . . .\u201d\n\nHe usually kept his wand with him at all times in the Wizarding world, and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable.\n\nA rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump. Winky the house-elf was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She was moving in a most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back.\n\n\u201cThere is bad wizards about!\u201d she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running. \u201cPeople high \u2014 high in the air! Winky is getting out of the way!\u201d\n\nAnd she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with her?\u201d said Ron, looking curiously after Winky. \u201cWhy can\u2019t she run properly?\u201d\n\n\u201cBet she didn\u2019t ask permission to hide,\u201d said Harry. He was thinking of Dobby: Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn\u2019t like, the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.\n\n\u201cYou know, house-elves get a very raw deal!\u201d said Hermione indignantly. \u201cIt\u2019s slavery, that\u2019s what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he\u2019s got her bewitched so she can\u2019t even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn\u2019t anyone do something about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the elves are happy, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Ron said. \u201cYou heard old Winky back at the match . . . \u2018House-elves is not supposed to have fun\u2019 . . . that\u2019s what she likes, being bossed around. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s people like you, Ron,\u201d Hermione began hotly, \u201cwho prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they\u2019re too lazy to \u2014\u201d\n\nAnother loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just keep moving, shall we?\u201d said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were. They set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn\u2019t there.\n\nThey followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.\n\n\u201cI pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!\u201d one of them shouted. \u201cI\u2019m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not!\u201d yelled his friend. \u201cYou\u2019re a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. . . . but I\u2019m a vampire hunter, I\u2019ve killed about ninety so far \u2014\u201d\n\nA third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, \u201cI\u2019m about to become the youngest-ever Minister of Magic, I am.\u201d\n\nHarry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard: His name was Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight Bus. He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron\u2019s face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling, \u201cDid I tell you I\u2019ve invented a broomstick that\u2019ll reach Jupiter?\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly!\u201d said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.\n\nHarry looked around. \u201cI reckon we can just wait here, you know. We\u2019ll hear anyone coming a mile off.\u201d\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.\n\nEven by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step. He looked very white and strained.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces. \u201cWhat are you doing in here, all alone?\u201d\n\nThey looked at one another, surprised.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 there\u2019s a sort of riot going on,\u201d said Ron.\n\nBagman stared at him.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the campsite . . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . . .\u201d\n\nBagman swore loudly.\n\n\u201cDamn them!\u201d he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop!\n\n\u201cNot exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?\u201d said Hermione, frowning.\n\n\u201cHe was a great Beater, though,\u201d said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree. \u201cThe Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them.\u201d\n\nHe took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down on the ground, and watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the model was slightly duck-footed and round-shouldered, much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was listening for noise from the campsite. Everything seemed much quieter; perhaps the riot was over.\n\n\u201cI hope the others are okay,\u201d said Hermione after a while.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cImagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,\u201d said Harry, sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves. \u201cHe\u2019s always said he\u2019d like to get something on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d wipe the smirk off old Draco\u2019s face, all right,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThose poor Muggles, though,\u201d said Hermione nervously. \u201cWhat if they can\u2019t get them down?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will,\u201d said Ron reassuringly. \u201cThey\u2019ll find a way.\u201d\n\n\u201cMad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic\u2019s out here tonight!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI mean, how do they expect to get away with it? Do you think they\u2019ve been drinking, or are they just \u2014\u201d\n\nBut she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry and Ron looked quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing. They waited, listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d called Harry.\n\nThere was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he said.\n\nAnd then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell.\n\n\u201cMORSMORDRE!\u201d\n\nAnd something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry\u2019s eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky.\n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.\n\nFor a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher, blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky like a new constellation.\n\nSuddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams. Harry didn\u2019t understand why, but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull, but he couldn\u2019t see anyone.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he called again.\n\n\u201cHarry, come on, move!\u201d Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Harry said, startled to see her face so white and terrified.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Dark Mark, Harry!\u201d Hermione moaned, pulling him as hard as she could. \u201cYou-Know-Who\u2019s sign!\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort\u2019s \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, come on!\u201d\n\nHarry turned \u2014 Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum \u2014 the three of them started across the clearing \u2014 but before they had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air, surrounding them.\n\nHarry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact: Each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, Ron, and Hermione.\n\nWithout pausing to think, he yelled, \u201cDUCK!\u201d\n\nHe seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.\n\n\u201cSTUPEFY!\u201d roared twenty voices \u2014 there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards\u2019 wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness \u2014\n\n\u201cStop!\u201d yelled a voice he recognized. \u201cSTOP! That\u2019s my son!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little higher. The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand. He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley striding toward them, looking terrified.\n\n\u201cRon \u2014 Harry\u201d \u2014 his voice sounded shaky \u2014 \u201cHermione \u2014 are you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut of the way, Arthur,\u201d said a cold, curt voice.\n\nIt was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them. Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch\u2019s face was taut with rage.\n\n\u201cWhich of you did it?\u201d he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. \u201cWhich of you conjured the Dark Mark?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do that!\u201d said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father. \u201cWhat did you want to attack us for?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not lie, sir!\u201d shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly at Ron, and his eyes were popping \u2014 he looked slightly mad. \u201cYou have been discovered at the scene of the crime!\u201d\n\n\u201cBarty,\u201d whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown, \u201cthey\u2019re kids, Barty, they\u2019d never have been able to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did the Mark come from, you three?\u201d said Mr. Weasley quickly.\n\n\u201cOver there,\u201d said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place where they had heard the voice. \u201cThere was someone behind the trees . . . they shouted words \u2014 an incantation \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, stood over there, did they?\u201d said Mr. Crouch, turning his popping eyes on Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face. \u201cSaid an incantation, did they? You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned, missy \u2014\u201d\n\nBut none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione\u2019s words, they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re too late,\u201d said the witch in the woolen dressing gown, shaking her head. \u201cThey\u2019ll have Disapparated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard. It was Amos Diggory, Cedric\u2019s father. \u201cOur Stunners went right through those trees. . . . There\u2019s a good chance we got them. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAmos, be careful!\u201d said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth.\n\nA few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.\n\n\u201cYes! We got them! There\u2019s someone here! Unconscious! It\u2019s \u2014 but \u2014 blimey . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got someone?\u201d shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding highly disbelieving. \u201cWho? Who is it?\u201d\n\nThey heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then crunching footsteps as Mr. Diggory reemerged from behind the trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp figure in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at once. It was Winky.\n\nMr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet. The other Ministry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch. For a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky. Then he appeared to come to life again.\n\n\u201cThis \u2014 cannot \u2014 be,\u201d he said jerkily. \u201cNo \u2014\u201d\n\nHe moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found Winky.\n\n\u201cNo point, Mr. Crouch,\u201d Mr. Diggory called after him. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else there.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it. They could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside, searching.\n\n\u201cBit embarrassing,\u201d Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at Winky\u2019s unconscious form. \u201cBarty Crouch\u2019s house-elf . . . I mean to say . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome off it, Amos,\u201d said Mr. Weasley quietly, \u201cyou don\u2019t seriously think it was the elf? The Dark Mark\u2019s a wizard\u2019s sign. It requires a wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Mr. Diggory, \u201cand she had a wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cHere, look.\u201d Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley. \u201cHad it in her hand. So that\u2019s clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken, for a start. No non-human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand.\u201d\n\nJust then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr. Weasley. Looking breathless and disorientated, he spun on the spot, goggling upward at the emerald-green skull.\n\n\u201cThe Dark Mark!\u201d he panted, almost trampling Winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues. \u201cWho did it? Did you get them? Barty! What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was still ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching.\n\n\u201cWhere have you been, Barty?\u201d said Bagman. \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you at the match? Your elf was saving you a seat too \u2014 gulping gargoyles!\u201d Bagman had just noticed Winky lying at his feet. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been busy, Ludo,\u201d said Mr. Crouch, still talking in the same jerky fashion, barely moving his lips. \u201cAnd my elf has been Stunned.\u201d\n\n\u201cStunned? By you lot, you mean? But why \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nComprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman\u2019s round, shiny face; he looked up at the skull, down at Winky, and then at Mr. Crouch.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he said. \u201cWinky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn\u2019t know how! She\u2019d need a wand, for a start!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she had one,\u201d said Mr. Diggory. \u201cI found her holding one, Ludo. If it\u2019s all right with you, Mr. Crouch, I think we should hear what she\u2019s got to say for herself.\u201d\n\nCrouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr. Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and said, \u201cRennervate!\u201d\n\nWinky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way. Watched by the silent wizards, she raised herself shakily into a sitting position. She caught sight of Mr. Diggory\u2019s feet, and slowly, tremulously, raised her eyes to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still, she looked up into the sky. Harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous, glassy eyes. She gave a gasp, looked wildly around the crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs.\n\n\u201cElf!\u201d said Mr. Diggory sternly. \u201cDo you know who I am? I\u2019m a member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!\u201d\n\nWinky began to rock backward and forward on the ground, her breath coming in sharp bursts. Harry was reminded forcibly of Dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience.\n\n\u201cAs you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while ago,\u201d said Mr. Diggory. \u201cAnd you were discovered moments later, right beneath it! An explanation, if you please!\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I \u2014 I is not doing it, sir!\u201d Winky gasped. \u201cI is not knowing how, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were found with a wand in your hand!\u201d barked Mr. Diggory, brandishing it in front of her. And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above, Harry recognized it.\n\n\u201cHey \u2014 that\u2019s mine!\u201d he said.\n\nEveryone in the clearing looked at him.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my wand!\u201d said Harry. \u201cI dropped it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dropped it?\u201d repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. \u201cIs this a confession? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmos, think who you\u2019re talking to!\u201d said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. \u201cIs Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 of course not,\u201d mumbled Mr. Diggory. \u201cSorry . . . carried away . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t drop it there, anyway,\u201d said Harry, jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull. \u201cI missed it right after we got into the wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky again, cowering at his feet. \u201cYou found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it up and thought you\u2019d have some fun with it, did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI is not doing magic with it, sir!\u201d squealed Winky, tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose. \u201cI is . . . I is . . . I is just picking it up, sir! I is not making the Dark Mark, sir, I is not knowing how!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her!\u201d said Hermione. She looked very nervous, speaking up in front of all these Ministry wizards, yet determined all the same. \u201cWinky\u2019s got a squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper!\u201d She looked around at Harry and Ron, appealing for their support. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound anything like Winky, did it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head. \u201cIt definitely didn\u2019t sound like an elf.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it was a human voice,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll soon see,\u201d growled Mr. Diggory, looking unimpressed. \u201cThere\u2019s a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed, elf, did you know that?\u201d\n\nWinky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr. Diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with Harry\u2019s.\n\n\u201cPrior Incantato!\u201d roared Mr. Diggory.\n\nHarry heard Hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpent-tongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met, but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them; it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke: the ghost of a spell.\n\n\u201cDeletrius!\u201d Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph, looking down upon Winky, who was still shaking convulsively.\n\n\u201cI is not doing it!\u201d she squealed, her eyes rolling in terror. \u201cI is not, I is not, I is not knowing how! I is a good elf, I isn\u2019t using wands, I isn\u2019t knowing how!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been caught red-handed, elf!\u201d Mr. Diggory roared. \u201cCaught with the guilty wand in your hand!\u201d\n\n\u201cAmos,\u201d said Mr. Weasley loudly, \u201cthink about it . . . precious few wizards know how to do that spell. . . . Where would she have learned it?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps Amos is suggesting,\u201d said Mr. Crouch, cold anger in every syllable, \u201cthat I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark?\u201d\n\nThere was a deeply unpleasant silence. Amos Diggory looked horrified. \u201cMr. Crouch . . . not . . . not at all . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that Mark!\u201d barked Mr. Crouch. \u201cHarry Potter \u2014 and myself! I suppose you are familiar with the boy\u2019s story, Amos?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course \u2014 everyone knows \u2014\u201d muttered Mr. Diggory, looking highly discomforted.\n\n\u201cAnd I trust you remember the many proofs I have given, over a long career, that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them?\u201d Mr. Crouch shouted, his eyes bulging again.\n\n\u201cMr. Crouch, I \u2014 I never suggested you had anything to do with it!\u201d Amos Diggory muttered again, now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard.\n\n\u201cIf you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!\u201d shouted Mr. Crouch. \u201cWhere else would she have learned to conjure it?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe \u2014 she might\u2019ve picked it up anywhere \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely, Amos,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cShe might have picked it up anywhere. . . . Winky?\u201d he said kindly, turning to the elf, but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her. \u201cWhere exactly did you find Harry\u2019s wand?\u201d\n\nWinky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I is finding it . . . finding it there, sir. . . .\u201d she whispered, \u201cthere . . . in the trees, sir. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, Amos?\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cWhoever conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right after they\u2019d done it, leaving Harry\u2019s wand behind. A clever thing to do, not using their own wand, which could have betrayed them. And Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then, she\u2019d have been only a few feet away from the real culprit!\u201d said Mr. Diggory impatiently. \u201cElf? Did you see anyone?\u201d\n\nWinky began to tremble worse than ever. Her giant eyes flickered from Mr. Diggory, to Ludo Bagman, and onto Mr. Crouch. Then she gulped and said, \u201cI is seeing no one, sir . . . no one . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAmos,\u201d said Mr. Crouch curtly, \u201cI am fully aware that, in the ordinary course of events, you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning. I ask you, however, to allow me to deal with her.\u201d\n\nMr. Diggory looked as though he didn\u2019t think much of this suggestion at all, but it was clear to Harry that Mr. Crouch was such an important member of the Ministry that he did not dare refuse him.\n\n\u201cYou may rest assured that she will be punished,\u201d Mr. Crouch added coldly.\n\n\u201cM-m-master . . .\u201d Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes brimming with tears. \u201cM-m-master, p-p-please . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze.\n\n\u201cWinky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch\u2019s feet. \u201cNo, master! Not clothes, not clothes!\u201d\n\nHarry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cBut she was frightened!\u201d Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at Mr. Crouch. \u201cYour elf\u2019s scared of heights, and those wizards in masks were levitating people! You can\u2019t blame her for wanting to get out of their way!\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes.\n\n\u201cI have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,\u201d he said coldly, looking over at Hermione. \u201cI have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master, and to her master\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nWinky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing. There was a very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr. Weasley, who said quietly, \u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll take my lot back to the tent, if nobody\u2019s got any objections. Amos, that wand\u2019s told us all it can \u2014 if Harry could have it back, please \u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it.\n\n\u201cCome on, you three,\u201d Mr. Weasley said quietly. But Hermione didn\u2019t seem to want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf. \u201cHermione!\u201d Mr. Weasley said, more urgently. She turned and followed Harry and Ron out of the clearing and off through the trees.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to Winky?\u201d said Hermione, the moment they had left the clearing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cThe way they were treating her!\u201d said Hermione furiously. \u201cMr. Diggory, calling her \u2018elf\u2019 all the time . . . and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn\u2019t do it and he\u2019s still going to sack her! He didn\u2019t care how frightened she\u2019d been, or how upset she was \u2014 it was like she wasn\u2019t even human!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s not,\u201d said Ron.\n\nHermione rounded on him.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she hasn\u2019t got feelings, Ron. It\u2019s disgusting the way \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, I agree with you,\u201d said Mr. Weasley quickly, beckoning her on, \u201cbut now is not the time to discuss elf rights. I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can. What happened to the others?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe lost them in the dark,\u201d said Ron. \u201cDad, why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything back at the tent,\u201d said Mr. Weasley tensely.\n\nBut when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was impeded. A large crowd of frightened-looking witches and wizards was congregated there, and when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them, many of them surged forward.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho conjured it?\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 Him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s not Him,\u201d said Mr. Weasley impatiently. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who it was; it looks like they Disapparated. Now excuse me, please, I want to get to bed.\u201d\n\nHe led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite. All was quiet now; there was no sign of the masked wizards, though several ruined tents were still smoking.\n\nCharlie\u2019s head was poking out of the boys\u2019 tent.\n\n\u201cDad, what\u2019s going on?\u201d he called through the dark. \u201cFred, George, and Ginny got back okay, but the others \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got them here,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the tent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered after him.\n\nBill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to his arm, which was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his shirt, and Percy was sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.\n\n\u201cDid you get them, Dad?\u201d said Bill sharply. \u201cThe person who conjured the Mark?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cWe found Barty Crouch\u2019s elf holding Harry\u2019s wand, but we\u2019re none the wiser about who actually conjured the Mark.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s wand?\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cMr. Crouch\u2019s elf?\u201d said Percy, sounding thunderstruck.\n\nWith some assistance from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Mr. Weasley explained what had happened in the woods. When they had finished their story, Percy swelled indignantly.\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!\u201d he said. \u201cRunning away when he\u2019d expressly told her not to . . . embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry . . . how would that have looked, if she\u2019d been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything \u2014 she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!\u201d Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback. Hermione had always got on fairly well with Percy \u2014 better, indeed, than any of the others.\n\n\u201cHermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch\u2019s position can\u2019t afford a house-elf who\u2019s going to run amok with a wand!\u201d said Percy pompously, recovering himself.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t run amok!\u201d shouted Hermione. \u201cShe just picked it up off the ground!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?\u201d said Ron impatiently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hurting anyone. . . . Why\u2019s it such a big deal?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s You-Know-Who\u2019s symbol, Ron,\u201d said Hermione, before anyone else could answer. \u201cI read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it hasn\u2019t been seen for thirteen years,\u201d said Mr. Weasley quietly. \u201cOf course people panicked . . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d said Ron, frowning. \u201cI mean . . . it\u2019s still only a shape in the sky. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cThe terror it inspired . . . you have no idea, you\u2019re too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you\u2019re about to find inside. . . .\u201d Mr. Weasley winced. \u201cEveryone\u2019s worst fear . . . the very worst . . .\u201d\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut, said, \u201cWell, it didn\u2019t help us tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we\u2019d got near enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground, though. They\u2019re having their memories modified right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath Eaters?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat are Death Eaters?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what You-Know-Who\u2019s supporters called themselves,\u201d said Bill. \u201cI think we saw what\u2019s left of them tonight \u2014 the ones who managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t prove it was them, Bill,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cThough it probably was,\u201d he added hopelessly.\n\n\u201cYeah, I bet it was!\u201d said Ron suddenly. \u201cDad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what were Voldemort\u2019s supporters \u2014\u201d Harry began. Everybody flinched \u2014 like most of the Wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort\u2019s name. \u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cWhat were You-Know-Who\u2019s supporters up to, levitating Muggles? I mean, what was the point?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point?\u201d said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. \u201cHarry, that\u2019s their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn\u2019t resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them,\u201d he finished disgustedly.\n\n\u201cBut if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark?\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey\u2019d have been pleased to see it, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cUse your brains, Ron,\u201d said Bill. \u201cIf they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet they\u2019d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they\u2019d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives. . . . I don\u2019t reckon he\u2019d be over-pleased with them, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo . . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark . . .\u201d said Hermione slowly, \u201cwere they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour guess is as good as ours, Hermione,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you this . . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I\u2019d be very surprised if the person who did it hadn\u2019t been a Death Eater once, even if they\u2019re not now. . . . Listen, it\u2019s very late, and if your mother hears what\u2019s happened she\u2019ll be worried sick. We\u2019ll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here.\u201d\n\nHarry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he ought to feel exhausted: It was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake \u2014 wide-awake, and worried.\n\nThree days ago \u2014 it felt like much longer, but it had only been three days \u2014 he had awoken with his scar burning. And tonight, for the first time in thirteen years, Lord Voldemort\u2019s mark had appeared in the sky. What did these things mean?\n\nHe thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive. Would Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after Charlie\u2019s snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter10": "MAYHEM AT THE MINISTRY\n\n\n\n\nMr. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor. \u201cSometimes, when a person\u2019s memory\u2019s modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while . . . and that was a big thing they had to make him forget.\u201d\n\nThey heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St. Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.\n\n\u201cOh thank goodness, thank goodness!\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard, came running toward them, still wearing her bedroom slippers, her face pale and strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in her hand.\n\n\u201cArthur \u2014 I\u2019ve been so worried \u2014 so worried \u2014\u201d\n\nShe flung her arms around Mr. Weasley\u2019s neck, and the Daily Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down, Harry saw the headline: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling black-and-white photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all right,\u201d Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, \u201cyou\u2019re alive. . . . Oh boys . . .\u201d\n\nAnd to everybody\u2019s surprise, she seized Fred and George and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together.\n\n\u201cOuch! Mum \u2014 you\u2019re strangling us \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouted at you before you left!\u201d Mrs. Weasley said, starting to sob. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn\u2019t get enough O.W.L.s? Oh Fred . . . George . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, now, Molly, we\u2019re all perfectly okay,\u201d said Mr. Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house. \u201cBill,\u201d he added in an undertone, \u201cpick up that paper, I want to see what it says. . . .\u201d\n\nWhen they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and Hermione had made Mrs. Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into which Mr. Weasley insisted on pouring a shot of Ogdens Old Firewhisky, Bill handed his father the newspaper. Mr. Weasley scanned the front page while Percy looked over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d said Mr. Weasley heavily. \u201cMinistry blunders . . . culprits not apprehended . . . lax security . . . Dark wizards running unchecked . . . national disgrace . . . Who wrote this? Ah . . . of course . . . Rita Skeeter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat woman\u2019s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!\u201d said Percy furiously. \u201cLast week she was saying we\u2019re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness, when we should be stamping out vampires! As if it wasn\u2019t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo us a favor, Perce,\u201d said Bill, yawning, \u201cand shut up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m mentioned,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and whisky. \u201cIf I\u2019d seen that, I\u2019d have known you were alive!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot by name,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cListen to this: \u2018If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry of Magic, they were sadly disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but refusing to give any more information. Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later, remains to be seen.\u2019 Oh really,\u201d said Mr. Weasley in exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. \u201cNobody was hurt. What was I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods . . . well, there certainly will be rumors now she\u2019s printed that.\u201d\n\nHe heaved a deep sigh. \u201cMolly, I\u2019m going to have to go into the office; this is going to take some smoothing over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you, Father,\u201d said Percy importantly. \u201cMr. Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person.\u201d\n\nHe bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset.\n\n\u201cArthur, you\u2019re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn\u2019t got anything to do with your office; surely they can handle this without you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go, Molly,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cI\u2019ve made things worse. I\u2019ll just change into my robes and I\u2019ll be off. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Weasley,\u201d said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself, \u201cHedwig hasn\u2019t arrived with a letter for me, has she?\u201d\n\n\u201cHedwig, dear?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. \u201cNo . . . no, there hasn\u2019t been any post at all.\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at both of them he said, \u201cAll right if I go and dump my stuff in your room, Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . think I will too,\u201d said Ron at once. \u201cHermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Harry?\u201d said Ron, the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something I haven\u2019t told you,\u201d Harry said. \u201cOn Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s reactions were almost exactly as Harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a number of reference books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked dumbstruck.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 he wasn\u2019t there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean \u2014 last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t on Privet Drive,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut I was dreaming about him . . . him and Peter \u2014 you know, Wormtail. I can\u2019t remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill . . . someone.\u201d\n\nHe had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying \u201cme,\u201d but couldn\u2019t bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified than she already did.\n\n\u201cIt was only a dream,\u201d said Ron bracingly. \u201cJust a nightmare.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but was it, though?\u201d said Harry, turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, isn\u2019t it? . . . My scar hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and Voldemort\u2019s sign\u2019s up in the sky again.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2014 say \u2014 his \u2014 name!\u201d Ron hissed through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cAnd remember what Professor Trelawney said?\u201d Harry went on, ignoring Ron. \u201cAt the end of last year?\u201d\n\nProfessor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts. Hermione\u2019s terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.\n\n\u201cOh Harry, you aren\u2019t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t there,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear her. This time was different. I told you, she went into a trance \u2014 a real one. And she said the Dark Lord would rise again . . . greater and more terrible than ever before . . . and he\u2019d manage it because his servant was going to go back to him . . . and that night Wormtail escaped.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his Chudley Cannons bedspread.\n\n\u201cWhy were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?\u201d Hermione asked. \u201cAre you expecting a letter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told Sirius about my scar,\u201d said Harry, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for his answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood thinking!\u201d said Ron, his expression clearing. \u201cI bet Sirius\u2019ll know what to do!\u201d\n\n\u201cI hoped he\u2019d get back to me quickly,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t know where Sirius is . . . he could be in Africa or somewhere, couldn\u2019t he?\u201d said Hermione reasonably. \u201cHedwig\u2019s not going to manage that journey in a few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.\n\n\u201cCome and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCome on \u2014 three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play. . . . You can try out the Wronski Feint. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRon,\u201d said Hermione, in an I-don\u2019t-think-you\u2019re-being-very-sensitive sort of voice, \u201cHarry doesn\u2019t want to play Quidditch right now. . . . He\u2019s worried, and he\u2019s tired. . . . We all need to go to bed. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I want to play Quidditch,\u201d said Harry suddenly. \u201cHang on, I\u2019ll get my Firebolt.\u201d\n\nHermione left the room, muttering something that sounded very much like \u201cBoys.\u201d\n\nNeither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week. Both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up, and returned well after dinner every night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute uproar,\u201d Percy told them importantly the Sunday evening before they were due to return to Hogwarts. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting out fires all week. People keep sending Howlers, and of course, if you don\u2019t open a Howler straight away, it explodes. Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are they all sending Howlers?\u201d asked Ginny, who was mending her copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with Spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire.\n\n\u201cComplaining about security at the World Cup,\u201d said Percy. \u201cThey want compensation for their ruined property. Mundungus Fletcher\u2019s put in a claim for a twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi, but I\u2019ve got his number. I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner. Harry liked this clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to know the time, but otherwise very informative. It had nine golden hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the Weasley family\u2019s names. There were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be. \u201cHome,\u201d \u201cschool,\u201d and \u201cwork\u201d were there, but there was also \u201ctraveling,\u201d \u201clost,\u201d \u201chospital,\u201d \u201cprison,\u201d and, in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock, \u201cmortal peril.\u201d\n\nEight of the hands were currently pointing to the \u201chome\u201d position, but Mr. Weasley\u2019s, which was the longest, was still pointing to \u201cwork.\u201d Mrs. Weasley sighed.\n\n\u201cYour father hasn\u2019t had to go into the office on weekends since the days of You-Know-Who,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re working him far too hard. His dinner\u2019s going to be ruined if he doesn\u2019t come home soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Father feels he\u2019s got to make up for his mistake at the match, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d said Percy. \u201cIf truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once.\n\n\u201cIf Dad hadn\u2019t said anything, old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented,\u201d said Bill, who was playing chess with Ron. \u201cRita Skeeter never makes anyone look good. Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts Charm Breakers once, and called me \u2018a long-haired pillock\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it is a bit long, dear,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley gently. \u201cIf you\u2019d just let me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Mum.\u201d\n\nRain lashed against the living room window. Hermione was immersed in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs. Weasley had bought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley. Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava. Harry was polishing his Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit Hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads bent over a piece of parchment.\n\n\u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes on the twins.\n\n\u201cHomework,\u201d said Fred vaguely.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, you\u2019re still on holiday,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve left it a bit late,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not by any chance writing out a new order form, are you?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley shrewdly. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be thinking of re-starting Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes, by any chance?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Mum,\u201d said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face. \u201cIf the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow, and George and I died, how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation?\u201d\n\nEveryone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cOh your father\u2019s coming!\u201d she said suddenly, looking up at the clock again.\n\nMr. Weasley\u2019s hand had suddenly spun from \u201cwork\u201d to \u201ctraveling\u201d; a second later it had shuddered to a halt on \u201chome\u201d with the others, and they heard him calling from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cComing, Arthur!\u201d called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying out of the room.\n\nA few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray. He looked completely exhausted.\n\n\u201cWell, the fat\u2019s really in the fire now,\u201d he told Mrs. Weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower. \u201cRita Skeeter\u2019s been ferreting around all week, looking for more Ministry mess-ups to report. And now she\u2019s found out about poor old Bertha going missing, so that\u2019ll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow. I told Bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks,\u201d said Percy swiftly.\n\n\u201cCrouch is very lucky Rita hasn\u2019t found out about Winky,\u201d said Mr. Weasley irritably. \u201cThere\u2019d be a week\u2019s worth of headlines in his house-elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought we were all agreed that that elf, while irresponsible, did not conjure the Mark?\u201d said Percy hotly.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves!\u201d said Hermione angrily.\n\n\u201cNow look here, Hermione!\u201d said Percy. \u201cA high-ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHis slave, you mean!\u201d said Hermione, her voice rising passionately, \u201cbecause he didn\u2019t pay Winky, did he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019d all better go upstairs and check that you\u2019ve packed properly!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, breaking up the argument. \u201cCome on now, all of you. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his Firebolt over his shoulder, and went back upstairs with Ron. The rain sounded even louder at the top of the house, accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic. Pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered. The sight of the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement.\n\n\u201cBung him some Owl Treats,\u201d said Ron, throwing a packet across to Harry. \u201cIt might shut him up.\u201d\n\nHarry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon\u2019s cage, then turned to his trunk. Hedwig\u2019s cage stood next to it, still empty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been over a week,\u201d Harry said, looking at Hedwig\u2019s deserted perch. \u201cRon, you don\u2019t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, it would\u2019ve been in the Daily Prophet,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe Ministry would want to show they\u2019d caught someone, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I suppose. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, here\u2019s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley. And she\u2019s got some gold out of your vault for you . . . and she\u2019s washed all your socks.\u201d\n\nHe heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry\u2019s camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it. Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart from The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-making kit \u2014 he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him.\n\n\u201cWhat is that supposed to be?\u201d\n\nHe was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long, maroon velvet dress. It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs.\n\nThere was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley entered, carrying an armful of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes.\n\n\u201cHere you are,\u201d she said, sorting them into two piles. \u201cNow, mind you pack them properly so they don\u2019t crease.\u201d\n\n\u201cMum, you\u2019ve given me Ginny\u2019s new dress,\u201d said Ron, handing it out to her.\n\n\u201cOf course I haven\u2019t,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cThat\u2019s for you. Dress robes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron, looking horror-struck.\n\n\u201cDress robes!\u201d repeated Mrs. Weasley. \u201cIt says on your school list that you\u2019re supposed to have dress robes this year . . . robes for formal occasions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d said Ron in disbelief. \u201cI\u2019m not wearing that, no way.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone wears them, Ron!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley crossly. \u201cThey\u2019re all like that! Your father\u2019s got some for smart parties!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go starkers before I put that on,\u201d said Ron stubbornly.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so silly,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have dress robes, they\u2019re on your list! I got some for Harry too . . . show him, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\nIn some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed. It wasn\u2019t as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes didn\u2019t have any lace on them at all \u2014 in fact, they were more or less the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black.\n\n\u201cI thought they\u2019d bring out the color of your eyes, dear,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley fondly.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re okay!\u201d said Ron angrily, looking at Harry\u2019s robes. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I have some like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause . . . well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there wasn\u2019t a lot of choice!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, flushing.\n\nHarry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would never take it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never wearing them,\u201d Ron was saying stubbornly. \u201cNever.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d snapped Mrs. Weasley. \u201cGo naked. And, Harry, make sure you get a picture of him. Goodness knows I could do with a laugh.\u201d\n\nShe left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a funny spluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.\n\n\u201cWhy is everything I own rubbish?\u201d said Ron furiously, striding across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon\u2019s beak."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter11": "ABOARD THE HOGWARTS EXPRESS\n\n\n\n\nThere was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air when Harry awoke next morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts Express.\n\nHe, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed.\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d she called up the staircase. \u201cArthur! Urgent message from the Ministry!\u201d\n\nHarry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came clattering past with his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve got a quill here somewhere!\u201d \u2014 and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire, talking to \u2014\n\nHarry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly.\n\nAmos Diggory\u2019s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.\n\n\u201c. . . Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went and called those what-d\u2019you-call-\u2019ems \u2014 please-men. Arthur, you\u2019ve got to get over there \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201c\u2014 it\u2019s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,\u201d said Mr. Diggory\u2019s head. \u201cI had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls, and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off \u2014 if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does Mad-Eye say happened?\u201d asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take notes.\n\nMr. Diggory\u2019s head rolled its eyes. \u201cSays he heard an intruder in his yard. Says he was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed by his dustbins.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did the dustbins do?\u201d asked Mr. Weasley, scribbling frantically.\n\n\u201cMade one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as I can tell,\u201d said Mr. Diggory. \u201cApparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please-men turned up \u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley groaned.\n\n\u201cAnd what about the intruder?\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur, you know Mad-Eye,\u201d said Mr. Diggory\u2019s head, rolling its eyes again. \u201cSomeone creeping into his yard in the dead of night? More likely there\u2019s a very shell-shocked cat wandering around somewhere, covered in potato peelings. But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad-Eye, he\u2019s had it \u2014 think of his record \u2014 we\u2019ve got to get him off on a minor charge, something in your department \u2014 what are exploding dustbins worth?\u201d\n\n\u201cMight be a caution,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, still writing very fast, his brow furrowed. \u201cMad-Eye didn\u2019t use his wand? He didn\u2019t actually attack anyone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window,\u201d said Mr. Diggory, \u201cbut they\u2019ll have a job proving it, there aren\u2019t any casualties.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019m off,\u201d Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again.\n\nMr. Diggory\u2019s head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cSorry about this, Molly,\u201d it said, more calmly, \u201cbothering you so early and everything . . . but Arthur\u2019s the only one who can get Mad-Eye off, and Mad-Eye\u2019s supposed to be starting his new job today. Why he had to choose last night . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind, Amos,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cSure you won\u2019t have a bit of toast or anything before you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh go on, then,\u201d said Mr. Diggory.\n\nMrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into Mr. Diggory\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cFanks,\u201d he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop, vanished.\n\nHarry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-byes to Bill, Charlie, Percy, and the girls. Within five minutes, he was back in the kitchen, his robes on the right way now, dragging a comb through his hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d better hurry \u2014 you have a good term, boys,\u201d said Mr. Weasley to Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to Disapparate. \u201cMolly, are you going to be all right taking the kids to King\u2019s Cross?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I will,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just look after Mad-Eye, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.\n\n\u201cDid someone say Mad-Eye?\u201d Bill asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s he been up to now?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says someone tried to break into his house last night,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cMad-Eye Moody?\u201d said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his toast. \u201cIsn\u2019t he that nutter \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley sternly.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d said Fred quietly as Mrs. Weasley left the room. \u201cBirds of a feather . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMoody was a great wizard in his time,\u201d said Bill.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an old friend of Dumbledore\u2019s, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Charlie.\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s not what you\u2019d call normal, though, is he?\u201d said Fred. \u201cI mean, I know he\u2019s a genius and everything . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is Mad-Eye?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s retired, used to work at the Ministry,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cI met him once when Dad took me in to work with him. He was an Auror \u2014 one of the best . . . a Dark wizard catcher,\u201d he added, seeing Harry\u2019s blank look. \u201cHalf the cells in Azkaban are full because of him. He made himself loads of enemies, though . . . the families of people he caught, mainly . . . and I heard he\u2019s been getting really paranoid in his old age. Doesn\u2019t trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark wizards everywhere.\u201d\n\nBill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King\u2019s Cross station, but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he really needed to get to work.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t justify taking more time off at the moment,\u201d he told them. \u201cMr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you know what, Percy?\u201d said George seriously. \u201cI reckon he\u2019ll know your name soon.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.\n\n\u201cArthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,\u201d Mrs. Weasley whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain-washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy Hogwarts trunks into their cars. \u201cBut there weren\u2019t any to spare. . . . Oh dear, they don\u2019t look happy, do they?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket. Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster\u2019s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks went off unexpectedly when Fred\u2019s trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the man\u2019s leg.\n\nThe journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the time they entered London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at King\u2019s Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever, and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station.\n\nHarry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters by now. It was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. The only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups today; Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters materialized in front of them.\n\nThe Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the many Hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie.\n\n\u201cI might be seeing you all sooner than you think,\u201d said Charlie, grinning, as he hugged Ginny good-bye.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Fred keenly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell Percy I mentioned it . . . it\u2019s \u2018classified information, until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it,\u2019 after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year,\u201d said Bill, hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said George impatiently.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have an interesting year,\u201d said Bill, his eyes twinkling. \u201cI might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cA bit of what?\u201d said Ron.\n\nBut at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley chivvied them toward the train doors.\n\n\u201cThanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,\u201d said Hermione as they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her.\n\n\u201cYeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOh it was my pleasure, dears,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cI\u2019d invite you for Christmas, but . . . well, I expect you\u2019re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts, what with . . . one thing and another.\u201d\n\n\u201cMum!\u201d said Ron irritably. \u201cWhat d\u2019you three know that we don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out this evening, I expect,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very exciting \u2014 mind you, I\u2019m very glad they\u2019ve changed the rules \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat rules?\u201d said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. . . . Now, behave, won\u2019t you? Won\u2019t you, Fred? And you, George?\u201d\n\nThe pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.\n\n\u201cTell us what\u2019s happening at Hogwarts!\u201d Fred bellowed out of the window as Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from them. \u201cWhat rules are they changing?\u201d\n\nBut Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had rounded the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment. The thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them. Ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon\u2019s cage to muffle his hooting.\n\n\u201cBagman wanted to tell us what\u2019s happening at Hogwarts,\u201d he said grumpily, sitting down next to Harry. \u201cAt the World Cup, remember? But my own mother won\u2019t say. Wonder what \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShh!\u201d Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs. Harry and Ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door.\n\n\u201c. . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you see. Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore \u2014 the man\u2019s such a Mudblood-lover \u2014 and Durmstrang doesn\u2019t admit that sort of riffraff. But Mother didn\u2019t like the idea of me going to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually learn them, not just the defense rubbish we do. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out Malfoy\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cSo he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?\u201d she said angrily. \u201cI wish he had gone, then we wouldn\u2019t have to put up with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDurmstrang\u2019s another Wizarding school?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione sniffily, \u201cand it\u2019s got a horrible reputation. According to An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d said Ron vaguely. \u201cWhere is it? What country?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, nobody knows, do they?\u201d said Hermione, raising her eyebrows.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 why not?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets,\u201d said Hermione matter-of-factly.\n\n\u201cCome off it,\u201d said Ron, starting to laugh. \u201cDurmstrang\u2019s got to be about the same size as Hogwarts \u2014 how are you going to hide a great big castle?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Hogwarts is hidden,\u201d said Hermione, in surprise. \u201cEveryone knows that . . . well, everyone who\u2019s read Hogwarts: A History, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust you, then,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSo go on \u2014 how d\u2019you hide a place like Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bewitched,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIf a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Durmstrang\u2019ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d said Hermione, shrugging, \u201cor it might have Muggle-repelling charms on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they\u2019ll have made it Unplottable \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCome again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can enchant a building so it\u2019s impossible to plot on a map, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . if you say so,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,\u201d said Hermione thoughtfully. \u201cSomewhere very cold, because they\u2019ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, think of the possibilities,\u201d said Ron dreamily. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident. . . . Shame his mother likes him. . . .\u201d\n\nThe rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north. The sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday. The lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor, and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron Cakes for them to share.\n\nSeveral of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother. Seamus was still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now; it was still squeaking \u201cTroy \u2014 Mullet \u2014 Moran!\u201d but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour or so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and started trying to learn a Summoning Charm.\n\nNeville listened jealously to the others\u2019 conversation as they relived the Cup match.\n\n\u201cGran didn\u2019t want to go,\u201d he said miserably. \u201cWouldn\u2019t buy tickets. It sounded amazing though.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLook at this, Neville. . . .\u201d\n\nHe rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.\n\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his pudgy hand.\n\n\u201cWe saw him right up close, as well,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe were in the Top Box \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first and last time in your life, Weasley.\u201d\n\nDraco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer. Evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had left ajar.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,\u201d said Harry coolly.\n\n\u201cWeasley . . . what is that?\u201d said Malfoy, pointing at Pigwidgeon\u2019s cage. A sleeve of Ron\u2019s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.\n\nRon made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.\n\n\u201cLook at this!\u201d said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron\u2019s robes and showing Crabbe and Goyle, \u201cWeasley, you weren\u2019t thinking of wearing these, were you? I mean \u2014 they were very fashionable in about 1890. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cEat dung, Malfoy!\u201d said Ron, the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of Malfoy\u2019s grip. Malfoy howled with derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.\n\n\u201cSo . . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name? There\u2019s money involved as well, you know . . . you\u2019d be able to afford some decent robes if you won. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d snapped Ron.\n\n\u201cAre you going to enter?\u201d Malfoy repeated. \u201cI suppose you will, Potter? You never miss a chance to show off, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEither explain what you\u2019re on about or go away, Malfoy,\u201d said Hermione testily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.\n\nA gleeful smile spread across Malfoy\u2019s pale face.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know?\u201d he said delightedly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and you don\u2019t even know? My God, my father told me about it ages ago . . . heard it from Cornelius Fudge. But then, Father\u2019s always associated with the top people at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father\u2019s too junior to know about it, Weasley . . . yes . . . they probably don\u2019t talk about important stuff in front of him. . . .\u201d\n\nLaughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle, and the three of them disappeared.\n\nRon got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered.\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her wand, muttered \u201cReparo!\u201d and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door.\n\n\u201cWell . . . making it look like he knows everything and we don\u2019t. . . .\u201d Ron snarled. \u201c\u2018Father\u2019s always associated with the top people at the Ministry.\u2019 . . . Dad could\u2019ve got a promotion any time . . . he just likes it where he is. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he does,\u201d said Hermione quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t let Malfoy get to you, Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHim! Get to me!? As if!\u201d said Ron, picking up one of the remaining Cauldron Cakes and squashing it into a pulp.\n\nRon\u2019s bad mood continued for the rest of the journey. He didn\u2019t talk much as they changed into their school robes, and was still glowering when the Hogwarts Express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitch-darkness of Hogsmeade station.\n\nAs the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead. Hermione bundled up Crookshanks in her cloak and Ron left his dress robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour. The rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as though buckets of ice-cold water were being emptied repeatedly over their heads.\n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid!\u201d Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform.\n\n\u201cAll righ\u2019, Harry?\u201d Hagrid bellowed back, waving. \u201cSee yeh at the feast if we don\u2019 drown!\u201d\n\nFirst years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by sailing across the lake with Hagrid.\n\n\u201cOooh, I wouldn\u2019t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,\u201d said Hermione fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville climbed gratefully into one of them, the door shut with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward Hogwarts Castle."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter12": "THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT\n\n\n\n\nThrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, \u201cif that keeps up the lake\u2019s going to overflow. I\u2019m soak \u2014 ARRGH!\u201d\n\nA large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto Ron\u2019s head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways into Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped \u2014 narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry\u2019s feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks. People all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again.\n\n\u201cPEEVES!\u201d yelled an angry voice. \u201cPeeves, come down here at ONCE!\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall, deputy headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.\n\n\u201cOuch \u2014 sorry, Miss Granger \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Professor!\u201d Hermione gasped, massaging her throat.\n\n\u201cPeeves, get down here NOW!\u201d barked Professor McGonagall, straightening her pointed hat and glaring upward through her square-rimmed spectacles.\n\n\u201cNot doing nothing!\u201d cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at several fifth-year girls, who screamed and dived into the Great Hall. \u201cAlready wet, aren\u2019t they? Little squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!\u201d And he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrived.\n\n\u201cI shall call the headmaster!\u201d shouted Professor McGonagall. \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Peeves \u2014\u201d\n\nPeeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs into the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling insanely.\n\n\u201cWell, move along, then!\u201d said Professor McGonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd. \u201cInto the Great Hall, come on!\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right, Ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his face.\n\nThe Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the start-of-term feast. Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in midair. The four long House tables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn\u2019t wobble too much on his partially severed neck.\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d he said, beaming at them.\n\n\u201cSays who?\u201d said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water. \u201cHope they hurry up with the Sorting. I\u2019m starving.\u201d\n\nThe Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn\u2019t been present at one since his own. He was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.\n\n\u201cHiya, Harry!\u201d\n\nIt was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.\n\n\u201cHi, Colin,\u201d said Harry warily.\n\n\u201cHarry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother\u2019s starting! My brother Dennis!\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 good,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really excited!\u201d said Colin, practically bouncing up and down in his seat. \u201cI just hope he\u2019s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers crossed, eh, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yeah, all right,\u201d said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick. \u201cBrothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses, don\u2019t they?\u201d he said. He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.\n\n\u201cOh no, not necessarily,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cParvati Patil\u2019s twin\u2019s in Ravenclaw, and they\u2019re identical. You\u2019d think they\u2019d be together, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor, but there was another empty chair too, and Harry couldn\u2019t think who else was missing.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?\u201d said Hermione, who was also looking up at the teachers.\n\nThey had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms. Harry\u2019s favorite by far had been Professor Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up and down the staff table. There was definitely no new face there.\n\n\u201cMaybe they couldn\u2019t get anyone!\u201d said Hermione, looking anxious.\n\nHarry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor Sinistra\u2019s other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape \u2014 Harry\u2019s least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry\u2019s loathing of Snape was matched only by Snape\u2019s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under Snape\u2019s overlarge nose \u2014 Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days.\n\nOn Snape\u2019s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed was Professor McGonagall\u2019s. Next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons. The tips of Dumbledore\u2019s long, thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced up at the ceiling too. It was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and he had never seen it look this stormy. Black and purple clouds were swirling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a fork of lightning flashed across it.\n\n\u201cOh hurry up,\u201d Ron moaned, beside Harry, \u201cI could eat a hippogriff.\u201d\n\nThe words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell. Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked. They appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed. All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school \u2014 all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid\u2019s moleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it looked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent. His small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully excited. When he had lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey\u2019s eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and mouthed, I fell in the lake! He looked positively delighted about it.\n\nProfessor McGonagall now placed a four-legged stool on the ground before the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, dirty, patched wizard\u2019s hat. The first years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was silence. Then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song:\n\nA thousand years or more ago,\n\nWhen I was newly sewn,\n\nThere lived four wizards of renown,\n\nWhose names are still well known:\n\nBold Gryffindor, from wild moor,\n\nFair Ravenclaw, from glen,\n\nSweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,\n\nShrewd Slytherin, from fen.\n\nThey shared a wish, a hope, a dream,\n\nThey hatched a daring plan\n\nTo educate young sorcerers\n\nThus Hogwarts School began.\n\nNow each of these four founders\n\nFormed their own House, for each\n\nDid value different virtues\n\nIn the ones they had to teach.\n\nBy Gryffindor, the bravest were\n\nPrized far beyond the rest;\n\nFor Ravenclaw, the cleverest\n\nWould always be the best;\n\nFor Hufflepuff, hard workers were\n\nMost worthy of admission;\n\nAnd power-hungry Slytherin\n\nLoved those of great ambition.\n\nWhile still alive they did divide\n\nTheir favorites from the throng,\n\nYet how to pick the worthy ones\n\nWhen they were dead and gone?\n\n\u2019Twas Gryffindor who found the way,\n\nHe whipped me off his head\n\nThe founders put some brains in me\n\nSo I could choose instead!\n\nNow slip me snug about your ears,\n\nI\u2019ve never yet been wrong,\n\nI\u2019ll have a look inside your mind\n\nAnd tell where you belong!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,\u201d said Harry, clapping along with everyone else.\n\n\u201cSings a different one every year,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a pretty boring life, hasn\u2019t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchment.\n\n\u201cWhen I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool,\u201d she told the first years. \u201cWhen the hat announces your House, you will go and sit at the appropriate table.\n\n\u201cAckerley, Stewart!\u201d\n\nA boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot, picked up the Sorting Hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.\n\n\u201cRAVENCLAW!\u201d shouted the hat.\n\nStewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.\n\n\u201cBaddock, Malcolm!\u201d\n\n\u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d\n\nThe table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins. Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.\n\n\u201cBranstone, Eleanor!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d\n\n\u201cCauldwell, Owen!\u201d\n\n\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d\n\n\u201cCreevey, Dennis!\u201d\n\nTiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid\u2019s moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers\u2019 table. About twice as tall as a normal man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild, tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming \u2014 a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide \u2014\n\n\u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d the hat shouted.\n\nHagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey, beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and hurried over to join his brother.\n\n\u201cColin, I fell in!\u201d he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty seat. \u201cIt was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!\u201d\n\n\u201cCool!\u201d said Colin, just as excitedly. \u201cIt was probably the giant squid, Dennis!\u201d\n\n\u201cWow!\u201d said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm-tossed, fathoms-deep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.\n\n\u201cDennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the black hair and glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?\u201d\n\nHarry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now Sorting Emma Dobbs.\n\nThe Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the four-legged stool, the line dwindling slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L\u2019s.\n\n\u201cOh hurry up,\u201d Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.\n\n\u201cNow, Ron, the Sorting\u2019s much more important than food,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick as \u201cMadley, Laura!\u201d became a Hufflepuff.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course it is, if you\u2019re dead,\u201d snapped Ron.\n\n\u201cI do hope this year\u2019s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick, applauding as \u201cMcDonald, Natalie!\u201d joined the Gryffindor table. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to break our winning streak, do we?\u201d\n\nGryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last three years in a row.\n\n\u201cPritchard, Graham!\u201d\n\n\u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d\n\n\u201cQuirke, Orla!\u201d\n\n\u201cRAVENCLAW!\u201d\n\nAnd finally, with \u201cWhitby, Kevin!\u201d(\u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d), the Sorting ended. Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them away.\n\n\u201cAbout time,\u201d said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his golden plate.\n\nProfessor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling around at the students, his arms opened wide in welcome.\n\n\u201cI have only two words to say to you,\u201d he told them, his deep voice echoing around the Hall. \u201cTuck in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHear, hear!\u201d said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before their eyes.\n\nNearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and Hermione loaded their own plates.\n\n\u201cAaah, \u2019at\u2019s be\u2019er,\u201d said Ron, with his mouth full of mashed potato.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky there\u2019s a feast at all tonight, you know,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick. \u201cThere was trouble in the kitchens earlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Wha\u2019 \u2019appened?\u201d said Harry, through a sizable chunk of steak.\n\n\u201cPeeves, of course,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick, shaking his head, which wobbled dangerously. He pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck. \u201cThe usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the feast \u2014 well, it\u2019s quite out of the question, you know what he\u2019s like, utterly uncivilized, can\u2019t see a plate of food without throwing it. We held a ghost\u2019s council \u2014 the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance \u2014 but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron put his foot down.\u201d\n\nThe Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains. He was the only person at Hogwarts who could really control Peeves.\n\n\u201cYeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something,\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cSo what did he do in the kitchens?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh the usual,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging. \u201cWreaked havoc and mayhem. Pots and pans everywhere. Place swimming in soup. Terrified the house-elves out of their wits \u2014\u201d\n\nClang.\n\nHermione had knocked over her golden goblet. Pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white linen orange, but Hermione paid no attention.\n\n\u201cThere are house-elves here?\u201d she said, staring, horror-struck, at Nearly Headless Nick. \u201cHere at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her reaction. \u201cThe largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe. Over a hundred.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen one!\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick. \u201cThey come out at night to do a bit of cleaning . . . see to the fires and so on. . . . I mean, you\u2019re not supposed to see them, are you? That\u2019s the mark of a good house-elf, isn\u2019t it, that you don\u2019t know it\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nHermione stared at him.\n\n\u201cBut they get paid?\u201d she said. \u201cThey get holidays, don\u2019t they? And \u2014 and sick leave, and pensions, and everything?\u201d\n\nNearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his neck.\n\n\u201cSick leave and pensions?\u201d he said, pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff. \u201cHouse-elves don\u2019t want sick leave and pensions!\u201d\n\nHermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food, then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from her.\n\n\u201cOh c\u2019mon, \u2019Er-my-knee,\u201d said Ron, accidentally spraying Harry with bits of Yorkshire pudding. \u201cOops \u2014 sorry, \u2019Arry \u2014\u201d He swallowed. \u201cYou won\u2019t get them sick leave by starving yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cSlave labor,\u201d said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose. \u201cThat\u2019s what made this dinner. Slave labor.\u201d\n\nAnd she refused to eat another bite.\n\nThe rain was still drumming heavily against the high, dark glass. Another clap of thunder shook the windows, and the stormy ceiling flashed, illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced, instantly, with puddings.\n\n\u201cTreacle tart, Hermione!\u201d said Ron, deliberately wafting its smell toward her. \u201cSpotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!\u201d\n\nBut Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor McGonagall that he gave up.\n\nWhen the puddings too had been demolished, and the last crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean, Albus Dumbledore got to his feet again. The buzz of chatter filling the Hall ceased almost at once, so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heard.\n\n\u201cSo!\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all. \u201cNow that we are all fed and watered,\u201d (\u201cHmph!\u201d said Hermione) \u201cI must once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices.\n\n\u201cMr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. The full list comprises some four hundred and thirty-seven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch\u2019s office, if anybody would like to check it.\u201d\n\nThe corners of Dumbledore\u2019s mouth twitched. He continued, \u201cAs ever, I would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is out-of-bounds to students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.\n\n\u201cIt is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George, his fellow members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing soundlessly at Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak. Dumbledore went on, \u201cThis is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers\u2019 time and energy \u2014 but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts \u2014\u201d\n\nBut at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the Great Hall banged open.\n\nA man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black traveling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall swiveled toward the stranger, suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling. He lowered his hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair, then began to walk up toward the teachers\u2019 table.\n\nA dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He reached the end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily toward Dumbledore. Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling. Hermione gasped.\n\nThe lightning had thrown the man\u2019s face into sharp relief, and it was a face unlike any Harry had ever seen. It looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel. Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the nose was missing. But it was the man\u2019s eyes that made him frightening.\n\nOne of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye \u2014 and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man\u2019s head, so that all they could see was whiteness.\n\nThe stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face, and Dumbledore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn\u2019t hear. He seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone. Dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his right-hand side.\n\nThe stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face, pulled a plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was left of his nose, and sniffed it. He then took a small knife out of his pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat. His normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the students.\n\n\u201cMay I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?\u201d said Dumbledore brightly into the silence. \u201cProfessor Moody.\u201d\n\nIt was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause, but none of the staff or students clapped except Dumbledore and Hagrid, who both put their hands together and applauded, but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by Moody\u2019s bizarre appearance to do more than stare at him.\n\n\u201cMoody?\u201d Harry muttered to Ron. \u201cMad-Eye Moody? The one your dad went to help this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be,\u201d said Ron in a low, awed voice.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cWhat happened to his face?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.\n\nMoody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome. Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and took a long draught from it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.\n\nDumbledore cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d he said, smiling at the sea of students before him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, \u201cwe are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re JOKING!\u201d said Fred Weasley loudly.\n\nThe tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody\u2019s arrival suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.\n\n\u201cI am not joking, Mr. Weasley,\u201d he said, \u201cthough now that you mention it, I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwhere was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well, some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.\n\n\u201cThe Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities \u2014 until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath toll?\u201d Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall; many of them were whispering excitedly to one another, and Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago.\n\n\u201cThere have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament,\u201d Dumbledore continued, \u201cnone of which has been very successful. However, our own Departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.\n\n\u201cThe Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their shortlisted contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going for it!\u201d Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.\n\n\u201cEager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age \u2014 that is to say, seventeen years or older \u2014 will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This\u201d \u2014 Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious \u2014 \u201cis a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.\u201d His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred\u2019s and George\u2019s mutinous faces. \u201cI therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.\n\n\u201cThe delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted support to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!\u201d\n\nDumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye Moody. There was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t do that!\u201d said George Weasley, who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore. \u201cWe\u2019re seventeen in April, why can\u2019t we have a shot?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not stopping me entering,\u201d said Fred stubbornly, also scowling at the top table. \u201cThe champions\u2019ll get to do all sorts of stuff you\u2019d never be allowed to do normally. And a thousand Galleons prize money!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, a faraway look on his face. \u201cYeah, a thousand Galleons . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cwe\u2019ll be the only ones left here if you don\u2019t move.\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s this impartial judge who\u2019s going to decide who the champions are?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Fred, \u201cbut it\u2019s them we\u2019ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore knows you\u2019re not of age, though,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he?\u201d said Fred shrewdly. \u201cSounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he\u2019ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are. Dumbledore\u2019s trying to stop us giving our names.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have died, though!\u201d said Hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another, narrower staircase.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Fred airily, \u201cbut that was years ago, wasn\u2019t it? Anyway, where\u2019s the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get \u2019round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon?\u201d Ron asked Harry. \u201cBe cool to enter, wouldn\u2019t it? But I s\u2019pose they might want someone older. . . . Dunno if we\u2019ve learned enough. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI definitely haven\u2019t,\u201d came Neville\u2019s gloomy voice from behind Fred and George.\n\n\u201cI expect my gran\u2019d want me to try, though. She\u2019s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor. I\u2019ll just have to \u2014 oops. . . .\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase. There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but Neville\u2019s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing wheezily.\n\n\u201cShut it, you,\u201d said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed.\n\nThey made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress.\n\n\u201cPassword?\u201d she said as they approached.\n\n\u201cBalderdash,\u201d said George, \u201ca prefect downstairs told me.\u201d\n\nThe portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed. A crackling fire warmed the circular common room, which was full of squashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look, and Harry distinctly heard her mutter \u201cSlave labor,\u201d before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls\u2019 dormitory.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top of the tower. Five four-poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls, each with its owner\u2019s trunk at the foot. Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed; Seamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard, and Dean had tacked up a poster of Viktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster of the West Ham football team was pinned right next to it.\n\n\u201cMental,\u201d Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed. Someone \u2014 a house-elf, no doubt \u2014 had placed warming pans between the sheets. It was extremely comfortable, lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside.\n\n\u201cI might go in for it, you know,\u201d Ron said sleepily through the darkness, \u201cif Fred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . . you never know, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose not. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind\u2019s eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen . . . he had become Hogwarts champion . . . he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding and screaming . . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament. . . . Cho\u2019s face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her face glowing with admiration. . . .\n\nHarry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn\u2019t see what he could."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter13": "MAD-EYE MOODY\n\n\n\n\nThe storm had blown itself out by the following morning, though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as Harry, Ron, and Hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast. A few seats along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard Tournament.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s not bad . . . outside all morning,\u201d said Ron, who was running his finger down his schedule. \u201cHerbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures . . . damn it, we\u2019re still with the Slytherins. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDouble Divination this afternoon,\u201d Harry groaned, looking down. Divination was his least favorite subject, apart from Potions. Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry\u2019s death, which he found extremely annoying.\n\n\u201cYou should have given it up like me, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione briskly, buttering herself some toast. \u201cThen you\u2019d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re eating again, I notice,\u201d said Ron, watching Hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights,\u201d said Hermione haughtily.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . and you were hungry,\u201d said Ron, grinning.\n\nThere was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail. Instinctively, Harry looked up, but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray. The owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed. A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap \u2014 Neville almost always forgot to pack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy\u2019s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and that Sirius hadn\u2019t even got his letter?\n\nHis preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.\n\n\u201cBubotubers,\u201d Professor Sprout told them briskly. \u201cThey need squeezing. You will collect the pus \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.\n\n\u201cPus, Finnigan, pus,\u201d said Professor Sprout, \u201cand it\u2019s extremely valuable, so don\u2019t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these bottles. Wear your dragon-hide gloves; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.\u201d\n\nSqueezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowish-green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson had collected several pints.\n\n\u201cThis\u2019ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,\u201d said Professor Sprout, stoppering the last bottle with a cork. \u201cAn excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike poor Eloise Midgen,\u201d said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff, in a hushed voice. \u201cShe tried to curse hers off.\u201d\n\n\u201cSilly girl,\u201d said Professor Sprout, shaking her head. \u201cBut Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.\u201d\n\nA booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds, signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Transfiguration, and the Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid\u2019s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of the Forbidden Forest.\n\nHagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions.\n\n\u201cMornin\u2019!\u201d Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \u201cBe\u2019er wait fer the Slytherins, they won\u2019 want ter miss this \u2014 Blast-Ended Skrewts!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome again?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHagrid pointed down into the crates.\n\n\u201cEurgh!\u201d squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward.\n\n\u201cEurgh\u201d just about summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts in Harry\u2019s opinion. They looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters, horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them in each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it would be propelled forward several inches.\n\n\u201cOn\u2019y jus\u2019 hatched,\u201d said Hagrid proudly, \u201cso yeh\u2019ll be able ter raise \u2019em yerselves! Thought we\u2019d make a bit of a project of it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why would we want to raise them?\u201d said a cold voice.\n\nThe Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco Malfoy. Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words.\n\nHagrid looked stumped at the question.\n\n\u201cI mean, what do they do?\u201d asked Malfoy. \u201cWhat is the point of them?\u201d\n\nHagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a few seconds\u2019 pause, then he said roughly, \u201cTha\u2019s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus\u2019 feedin\u2019 \u2019em today. Now, yeh\u2019ll wan\u2019 ter try \u2019em on a few diff\u2019rent things \u2014 I\u2019ve never had \u2019em before, not sure what they\u2019ll go fer \u2014 I got ant eggs an\u2019 frog livers an\u2019 a bit o\u2019 grass snake \u2014 just try \u2019em out with a bit of each.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst pus and now this,\u201d muttered Seamus.\n\nNothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry, Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry couldn\u2019t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless, because the skrewts didn\u2019t seem to have mouths.\n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes. \u201cIt got me!\u201d\n\nHagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.\n\n\u201cIts end exploded!\u201d said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn on his hand.\n\n\u201cAh, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding.\n\n\u201cEurgh!\u201d said Lavender Brown again. \u201cEurgh, Hagrid, what\u2019s that pointy thing on it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, some of \u2019em have got stings,\u201d said Hagrid enthusiastically (Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box). \u201cI reckon they\u2019re the males. . . . The females\u2019ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies. . . . I think they might be ter suck blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I can certainly see why we\u2019re trying to keep them alive,\u201d said Malfoy sarcastically. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want pets that can burn, sting, and bite all at once?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because they\u2019re not very pretty, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not useful,\u201d Hermione snapped. \u201cDragon blood\u2019s amazingly magical, but you wouldn\u2019t want a dragon for a pet, would you?\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard. Hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew only too well \u2014 he had owned one for a brief period during their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert. Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better.\n\n\u201cWell, at least the skrewts are small,\u201d said Ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later.\n\n\u201cThey are now,\u201d said Hermione in an exasperated voice, \u201cbut once Hagrid\u2019s found out what they eat, I expect they\u2019ll be six feet long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that won\u2019t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something, will it?\u201d said Ron, grinning slyly at her.\n\n\u201cYou know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAs a matter of fact I think he\u2019s right. The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all.\u201d\n\nThey sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes. Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry and Ron stared at her.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 is this the new stand on elf rights?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make yourself puke instead?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts. \u201cI just want to get to the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron in disbelief. \u201cHermione \u2014 it\u2019s the first day back! We haven\u2019t even got homework yet!\u201d\n\nHermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days. Then she leapt to her feet, said, \u201cSee you at dinner!\u201d and departed at high speed.\n\nWhen the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons, Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where, at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor Trelawney lived.\n\nThe familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder. As ever, the curtains were all closed; the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps, which were all draped with scarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat down at the same small circular table.\n\n\u201cGood day,\u201d said the misty voice of Professor Trelawney right behind Harry, making him jump.\n\nA very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering down at Harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him. The usual large amount of beads, chains, and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelight.\n\n\u201cYou are preoccupied, my dear,\u201d she said mournfully to Harry. \u201cMy inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within. And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless. I see difficult times ahead for you, alas . . . most difficult . . . I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass . . . and perhaps sooner than you think. . . .\u201d\n\nHer voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his eyes at Harry, who looked stonily back. Professor Trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire, facing the class. Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, who deeply admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs very close to her.\n\n\u201cMy dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,\u201d she said. \u201cThe movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which intermingle . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry\u2019s thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney\u2019s rambling talks on fortune-telling never held him exactly spellbound \u2014 though he couldn\u2019t help thinking about what she had just said to him. \u201c\u2018I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass . . .\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Hermione was right, Harry thought irritably, Professor Trelawney really was an old fraud. He wasn\u2019t dreading anything at the moment at all . . . well, unless you counted his fears that Sirius had been caught . . . but what did Professor Trelawney know? He had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortune-telling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky manner.\n\nExcept, of course, for that time at the end of last term, when she had made the prediction about Voldemort rising again . . . and Dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine, when Harry had described it to him. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHarry looked around; the whole class was staring at him. He sat up straight; he had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts.\n\n\u201cI was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her words.\n\n\u201cBorn under \u2014 what, sorry?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cSaturn, dear, the planet Saturn!\u201d said Professor Trelawney, sounding definitely irritated that he wasn\u2019t riveted by this news. \u201cI was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth. . . . Your dark hair . . . your mean stature . . . tragic losses so young in life . . . I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI was born in July.\u201d\n\nRon hastily turned his laugh into a hacking cough.\n\nHalf an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth. It was dull work, requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of angles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two Neptunes here,\u201d said Harry after a while, frowning down at his piece of parchment, \u201cthat can\u2019t be right, can it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAaaaah,\u201d said Ron, imitating Professor Trelawney\u2019s mystical whisper, \u201cwhen two Neptunes appear in the sky, it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\nSeamus and Dean, who were working nearby, sniggered loudly, though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from Lavender Brown \u2014 \u201cOh Professor, look! I think I\u2019ve got an unaspected planet! Oooh, which one\u2019s that, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is Uranus, my dear,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, peering down at the chart.\n\n\u201cCan I have a look at Uranus too, Lavender?\u201d said Ron.\n\nMost unfortunately, Professor Trelawney heard him, and it was this, perhaps, that made her give them so much homework at the end of the class.\n\n\u201cA detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,\u201d she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual airy-fairy self. \u201cI want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!\u201d\n\n\u201cMiserable old bat,\u201d said Ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall and dinner. \u201cThat\u2019ll take all weekend, that will. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of homework?\u201d said Hermione brightly, catching up with them. \u201cProfessor Vector didn\u2019t give us any at all!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, bully for Professor Vector,\u201d said Ron moodily.\n\nThey reached the entrance hall, which was packed with people queuing for dinner. They had just joined the end of the line, when a loud voice rang out behind them.\n\n\u201cWeasley! Hey, Weasley!\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione turned. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing there, each looking thoroughly pleased about something.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron shortly.\n\n\u201cYour dad\u2019s in the paper, Weasley!\u201d said Malfoy, brandishing a copy of the Daily Prophet and speaking very loudly, so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear. \u201cListen to this!\n\nFURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\n\nIt seems as though the Ministry of Magic\u2019s troubles are not yet at an end, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Recently under fire for its poor crowd control at the Quidditch World Cup, and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches, the Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley, of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMalfoy looked up.\n\n\u201cImagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley. It\u2019s almost as though he\u2019s a complete nonentity, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he crowed.\n\nEveryone in the entrance hall was listening now. Malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read on:\n\nArnold Weasley, who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago, was yesterday involved in a tussle with several Muggle law-keepers (\u201cpolicemen\u201d) over a number of highly aggressive dustbins. Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of \u201cMad-Eye\u201d Moody, the aged ex-Auror who retired from the Ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley found, upon arrival at Mr. Moody\u2019s heavily guarded house, that Mr. Moody had once again raised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen, but refused to answer Daily Prophet questions about why he had involved the Ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s a picture, Weasley!\u201d said Malfoy, flipping the paper over and holding it up. \u201cA picture of your parents outside their house \u2014 if you can call it a house! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nRon was shaking with fury. Everyone was staring at him.\n\n\u201cGet stuffed, Malfoy,\u201d said Harry. \u201cC\u2019mon, Ron. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, you were staying with them this summer, weren\u2019t you, Potter?\u201d sneered Malfoy. \u201cSo tell me, is his mother really that porky, or is it just the picture?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know your mother, Malfoy?\u201d said Harry \u2014 both he and Hermione had grabbed the back of Ron\u2019s robes to stop him from launching himself at Malfoy \u2014 \u201cthat expression she\u2019s got, like she\u2019s got dung under her nose? Has she always looked like that, or was it just because you were with her?\u201d\n\nMalfoy\u2019s pale face went slightly pink.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare insult my mother, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your fat mouth shut, then,\u201d said Harry, turning away.\n\nBANG!\n\nSeveral people screamed \u2014 Harry felt something white-hot graze the side of his face \u2014 he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand, but before he\u2019d even touched it, he heard a second loud BANG, and a roar that echoed through the entrance hall.\n\n\u201cOH NO YOU DON\u2019T, LADDIE!\u201d\n\nHarry spun around. Professor Moody was limping down the marble staircase. His wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret, which was shivering on the stone-flagged floor, exactly where Malfoy had been standing.\n\nThere was a terrified silence in the entrance hall. Nobody but Moody was moving a muscle. Moody turned to look at Harry \u2014 at least, his normal eye was looking at Harry; the other one was pointing into the back of his head.\n\n\u201cDid he get you?\u201d Moody growled. His voice was low and gravelly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cmissed.\u201d\n\n\u201cLEAVE IT!\u201d Moody shouted.\n\n\u201cLeave \u2014 what?\u201d Harry said, bewildered.\n\n\u201cNot you \u2014 him!\u201d Moody growled, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at Crabbe, who had just frozen, about to pick up the white ferret. It seemed that Moody\u2019s rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his head.\n\nMoody started to limp toward Crabbe, Goyle, and the ferret, which gave a terrified squeak and took off, streaking toward the dungeons.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so!\u201d roared Moody, pointing his wand at the ferret again \u2014 it flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like people who attack when their opponent\u2019s back\u2019s turned,\u201d growled Moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher, squealing in pain. \u201cStinking, cowardly, scummy thing to do. . . .\u201d\n\nThe ferret flew through the air, its legs and tail flailing helplessly.\n\n\u201cNever \u2014 do \u2014 that \u2014 again \u2014\u201d said Moody, speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again.\n\n\u201cProfessor Moody!\u201d said a shocked voice.\n\nProfessor McGonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of books.\n\n\u201cHello, Professor McGonagall,\u201d said Moody calmly, bouncing the ferret still higher.\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 what are you doing?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, her eyes following the bouncing ferret\u2019s progress through the air.\n\n\u201cTeaching,\u201d said Moody.\n\n\u201cTeach \u2014 Moody, is that a student?\u201d shrieked Professor McGonagall, the books spilling out of her arms.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Moody.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried Professor McGonagall, running down the stairs and pulling out her wand; a moment later, with a loud snapping noise, Draco Malfoy had reappeared, lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face. He got to his feet, wincing.\n\n\u201cMoody, we never use Transfiguration as a punishment!\u201d said Professor McGonagall weakly. \u201cSurely Professor Dumbledore told you that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe might\u2019ve mentioned it, yeah,\u201d said Moody, scratching his chin unconcernedly, \u201cbut I thought a good sharp shock \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe give detentions, Moody! Or speak to the offender\u2019s Head of House!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that, then,\u201d said Moody, staring at Malfoy with great dislike.\n\nMalfoy, whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation, looked malevolently up at Moody and muttered something in which the words \u201cmy father\u201d were distinguishable.\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d said Moody quietly, limping forward a few steps, the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall. \u201cWell, I know your father of old, boy. . . . You tell him Moody\u2019s keeping a close eye on his son . . . you tell him that from me. . . . Now, your Head of House\u2019ll be Snape, will it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Malfoy resentfully.\n\n\u201cAnother old friend,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to a chat with old Snape. . . . Come on, you. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he seized Malfoy\u2019s upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeons.\n\nProfessor McGonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments, then waved her wand at her fallen books, causing them to soar up into the air and back into her arms.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me,\u201d Ron said quietly to Harry and Hermione as they sat down at the Gryffindor table a few minutes later, surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happened.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Hermione in surprise.\n\n\u201cBecause I want to fix that in my memory forever,\u201d said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face. \u201cDraco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret . . .\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione both laughed, and Hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plates.\n\n\u201cHe could have really hurt Malfoy, though,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was good, really, that Professor McGonagall stopped it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d said Ron furiously, his eyes snapping open again, \u201cyou\u2019re ruining the best moment of my life!\u201d\n\nHermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed again.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going back to the library this evening?\u201d said Harry, watching her.\n\n\u201cGot to,\u201d said Hermione thickly. \u201cLoads to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you told us Professor Vector \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not schoolwork,\u201d she said. Within five minutes, she had cleared her plate and departed. No sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by Fred Weasley.\n\n\u201cMoody!\u201d he said. \u201cHow cool is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeyond cool,\u201d said George, sitting down opposite Fred.\n\n\u201cSupercool,\u201d said the twins\u2019 best friend, Lee Jordan, sliding into the seat beside George. \u201cWe had him this afternoon,\u201d he told Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d said Harry eagerly.\n\nFred, George, and Lee exchanged looks full of meaning.\n\n\u201cNever had a lesson like it,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cHe knows, man,\u201d said Lee.\n\n\u201cKnows what?\u201d said Ron, leaning forward.\n\n\u201cKnows what it\u2019s like to be out there doing it,\u201d said George impressively.\n\n\u201cDoing what?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFighting the Dark Arts,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s seen it all,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201c\u2019Mazing,\u201d said Lee.\n\nRon dived into his bag for his schedule.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got him till Thursday!\u201d he said in a disappointed voice."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter14": "THE UNFORGIVABLE CURSES\n\n\n\n\nThe next two days passed without great incident, unless you counted Neville melting his sixth cauldron in Potions. Professor Snape, who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer, gave Neville detention, and Neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse, having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads.\n\n\u201cYou know why Snape\u2019s in such a foul mood, don\u2019t you?\u201d said Ron to Harry as they watched Hermione teaching Neville a Scouring Charm to remove the toad guts from under his fingernails.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMoody.\u201d\n\nIt was common knowledge that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running. Snape had disliked all of their previous Dark Arts teachers, and shown it \u2014 but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to Mad-Eye Moody. Indeed, whenever Harry saw the two of them together \u2014 at mealtimes, or when they passed in the corridors \u2014 he had the distinct impression that Snape was avoiding Moody\u2019s eye, whether magical or normal.\n\n\u201cI reckon Snape\u2019s a bit scared of him, you know,\u201d Harry said thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cImagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad,\u201d said Ron, his eyes misting over, \u201cand bounced him all around his dungeon. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to Moody\u2019s first lesson so much that they arrived early on Thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung. The only person missing was Hermione, who turned up just in time for the lesson.\n\n\u201cBeen in the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLibrary.\u201d Harry finished her sentence for her. \u201cC\u2019mon, quick, or we won\u2019t get decent seats.\u201d\n\nThey hurried into three chairs right in front of the teacher\u2019s desk, took out their copies of The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, and waited, unusually quiet. Soon they heard Moody\u2019s distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor, and he entered the room, looking as strange and frightening as ever. They could just see his clawed, wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes.\n\n\u201cYou can put those away,\u201d he growled, stumping over to his desk and sitting down, \u201cthose books. You won\u2019t need them.\u201d\n\nThey returned the books to their bags, Ron looking excited.\n\nMoody took out a register, shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face, and began to call out names, his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around, fixing upon each student as he or she answered.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d he said, when the last person had declared themselves present, \u201cI\u2019ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class. Seems you\u2019ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures \u2014 you\u2019ve covered boggarts, Red Caps, hinkypunks, grindylows, Kappas, and werewolves, is that right?\u201d\n\nThere was a general murmur of assent.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re behind \u2014 very behind \u2014 on dealing with curses,\u201d said Moody. \u201cSo I\u2019m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I\u2019ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, aren\u2019t you staying?\u201d Ron blurted out.\n\nMoody\u2019s magical eye spun around to stare at Ron; Ron looked extremely apprehensive, but after a moment Moody smiled \u2014 the first time Harry had seen him do so. The effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever, but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile. Ron looked deeply relieved.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be Arthur Weasley\u2019s son, eh?\u201d Moody said. \u201cYour father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago. . . . Yeah, I\u2019m staying just the one year. Special favor to Dumbledore. . . . One year, and then back to my quiet retirement.\u201d\n\nHe gave a harsh laugh, and then clapped his gnarled hands together.\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 straight into it. Curses. They come in many strengths and forms. Now, according to the Ministry of Magic, I\u2019m supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that. I\u2019m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you\u2019re in the sixth year. You\u2019re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then. But Professor Dumbledore\u2019s got a higher opinion of your nerves, he reckons you can cope, and I say, the sooner you know what you\u2019re up against, the better. How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you\u2019ve never seen? A wizard who\u2019s about to put an illegal curse on you isn\u2019t going to tell you what he\u2019s about to do. He\u2019s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared. You need to be alert and watchful. You need to put that away, Miss Brown, when I\u2019m talking.\u201d\n\nLavender jumped and blushed. She had been showing Parvati her completed horoscope under the desk. Apparently Moody\u2019s magical eye could see through solid wood, as well as out of the back of his head.\n\n\u201cSo . . . do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by Wizarding law?\u201d\n\nSeveral hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s. Moody pointed at Ron, though his magical eye was still fixed on Lavender.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Ron tentatively, \u201cmy dad told me about one. . . . Is it called the Imperius Curse, or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d said Moody appreciatively. \u201cYour father would know that one. Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time, the Imperius Curse.\u201d\n\nMoody got heavily to his mismatched feet, opened his desk drawer, and took out a glass jar. Three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it. Harry felt Ron recoil slightly next to him \u2014 Ron hated spiders.\n\nMoody reached into the jar, caught one of the spiders, and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it and muttered, \u201cImperio!\u201d\n\nThe spider leapt from Moody\u2019s hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze. It stretched out its legs rigidly, then did a back flip, breaking the thread and landing on the desk, where it began to cartwheel in circles. Moody jerked his wand, and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance.\n\nEveryone was laughing \u2014 everyone except Moody.\n\n\u201cThink it\u2019s funny, do you?\u201d he growled. \u201cYou\u2019d like it, would you, if I did it to you?\u201d\n\nThe laughter died away almost instantly.\n\n\u201cTotal control,\u201d said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over. \u201cI could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats . . .\u201d\n\nRon gave an involuntary shudder.\n\n\u201cYears back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse,\u201d said Moody, and Harry knew he was talking about the days in which Voldemort had been all-powerful. \u201cSome job for the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of their own free will.\n\n\u201cThe Imperius Curse can be fought, and I\u2019ll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone\u2019s got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\u201d he barked, and everyone jumped.\n\nMoody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar.\n\n\u201cAnyone else know one? Another illegal curse?\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s hand flew into the air again and so, to Harry\u2019s slight surprise, did Neville\u2019s. The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology, which was easily his best subject. Neville looked surprised at his own daring.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Moody, his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one \u2014 the Cruciatus Curse,\u201d said Neville in a small but distinct voice.\n\nMoody was looking very intently at Neville, this time with both eyes.\n\n\u201cYour name\u2019s Longbottom?\u201d he said, his magical eye swooping down to check the register again.\n\nNeville nodded nervously, but Moody made no further inquiries. Turning back to the class at large, he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop, where it remained motionless, apparently too scared to move.\n\n\u201cThe Cruciatus Curse,\u201d said Moody. \u201cNeeds to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea,\u201d he said, pointing his wand at the spider. \u201cEngorgio!\u201d\n\nThe spider swelled. It was now larger than a tarantula. Abandoning all pretense, Ron pushed his chair backward, as far away from Moody\u2019s desk as possible.\n\nMoody raised his wand again, pointed it at the spider, and muttered, \u201cCrucio!\u201d\n\nAt once, the spider\u2019s legs bent in upon its body; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly, rocking from side to side. No sound came from it, but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice, it would have been screaming. Moody did not remove his wand, and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently \u2014\n\n\u201cStop it!\u201d Hermione said shrilly.\n\nHarry looked around at her. She was looking, not at the spider, but at Neville, and Harry, following her gaze, saw that Neville\u2019s hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him, his knuckles white, his eyes wide and horrified.\n\nMoody raised his wand. The spider\u2019s legs relaxed, but it continued to twitch.\n\n\u201cReducio,\u201d Moody muttered, and the spider shrank back to its proper size. He put it back into the jar.\n\n\u201cPain,\u201d said Moody softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse. . . . That one was very popular once too.\n\n\u201cRight . . . anyone know any others?\u201d\n\nHarry looked around. From the looks on everyone\u2019s faces, he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider. Hermione\u2019s hand shook slightly as, for the third time, she raised it into the air.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Moody, looking at her.\n\n\u201cAvada Kedavra,\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\nSeveral people looked uneasily around at her, including Ron.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Moody, another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth. \u201cYes, the last and worst. Avada Kedavra . . . the Killing Curse.\u201d\n\nHe put his hand into the glass jar, and almost as though it knew what was coming, the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar, trying to evade Moody\u2019s fingers, but he trapped it, and placed it upon the desktop. It started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface.\n\nMoody raised his wand, and Harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding.\n\n\u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d Moody roared.\n\nThere was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound, as though a vast, invisible something was soaring through the air \u2014 instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back, unmarked, but unmistakably dead. Several of the students stifled cries; Ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him.\n\nMoody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor.\n\n\u201cNot nice,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cNot pleasant. And there\u2019s no countercurse. There\u2019s no blocking it. Only one known person has ever survived it, and he\u2019s sitting right in front of me.\u201d\n\nHarry felt his face redden as Moody\u2019s eyes (both of them) looked into his own. He could feel everyone else looking around at him too. Harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it, but not really seeing it at all. . . .\n\nSo that was how his parents had died . . . exactly like that spider. Had they been unblemished and unmarked too? Had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death, before life was wiped from their bodies?\n\nHarry had been picturing his parents\u2019 deaths over and over again for three years now, ever since he\u2019d found out they had been murdered, ever since he\u2019d found out what had happened that night: Wormtail had betrayed his parents\u2019 whereabouts to Voldemort, who had come to find them at their cottage. How Voldemort had killed Harry\u2019s father first. How James Potter had tried to hold him off, while he shouted at his wife to take Harry and run . . . Voldemort had advanced on Lily Potter, told her to move aside so that he could kill Harry . . . how she had begged him to kill her instead, refused to stop shielding her son . . . and so Voldemort had murdered her too, before turning his wand on Harry. . . .\n\nHarry knew these details because he had heard his parents\u2019 voices when he had fought the dementors last year \u2014 for that was the terrible power of the dementors: to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives, and drown, powerless, in their own despair. . . .\n\nMoody was speaking again, from a great distance, it seemed to Harry. With a massive effort, he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what Moody was saying.\n\n\u201cAvada Kedavra\u2019s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it \u2014 you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I\u2019d get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not here to teach you how to do it.\n\n\u201cNow, if there\u2019s no countercurse, why am I showing you? Because you\u2019ve got to know. You\u2019ve got to appreciate what the worst is. You don\u2019t want to find yourself in a situation where you\u2019re facing it. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!\u201d he roared, and the whole class jumped again.\n\n\u201cNow . . . those three curses \u2014 Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus \u2014 are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That\u2019s what you\u2019re up against. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills . . . copy this down. . . .\u201d\n\nThey spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses. No one spoke until the bell rang \u2014 but when Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom, a torrent of talk burst forth. Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices \u2014 \u201cDid you see it twitch?\u201d \u201c\u2014 and when he killed it \u2014 just like that!\u201d\n\nThey were talking about the lesson, Harry thought, as though it had been some sort of spectacular show, but he hadn\u2019t found it very entertaining \u2014 and nor, it seemed, had Hermione.\n\n\u201cHurry up,\u201d she said tensely to Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cNot the ruddy library again?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione curtly, pointing up a side passage. \u201cNeville.\u201d\n\nNeville was standing alone, halfway up the passage, staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified, wide-eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse.\n\n\u201cNeville?\u201d Hermione said gently.\n\nNeville looked around.\n\n\u201cOh hello,\u201d he said, his voice much higher than usual. \u201cInteresting lesson, wasn\u2019t it? I wonder what\u2019s for dinner, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m starving, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeville, are you all right?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh yes, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice. \u201cVery interesting dinner \u2014 I mean lesson \u2014 what\u2019s for eating?\u201d\n\nRon gave Harry a startled look.\n\n\u201cNeville, what \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut an odd clunking noise sounded behind them, and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them. All four of them fell silent, watching him apprehensively, but when he spoke, it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, sonny,\u201d he said to Neville. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come up to my office? Come on . . . we can have a cup of tea. . . .\u201d\n\nNeville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody. He neither moved nor spoke. Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry.\n\n\u201cYou all right, are you, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, almost defiantly.\n\nMoody\u2019s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry. Then he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know. It seems harsh, maybe, but you\u2019ve got to know. No point pretending . . . well . . . come on, Longbottom, I\u2019ve got some books that might interest you.\u201d\n\nNeville looked pleadingly at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but they didn\u2019t say anything, so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away, one of Moody\u2019s gnarled hands on his shoulder.\n\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d said Ron, watching Neville and Moody turn the corner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hermione, looking pensive.\n\n\u201cSome lesson, though, eh?\u201d said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall. \u201cFred and George were right, weren\u2019t they? He really knows his stuff, Moody, doesn\u2019t he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry\u2019s face and didn\u2019t speak again until they reached the Great Hall, when he said he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney\u2019s predictions tonight, since they would take hours.\n\nHermione did not join in with Harry and Ron\u2019s conversation during dinner, but ate furiously fast, and then left for the library again. Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower, and Harry, who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner, now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we\u2019d seen the curses?\u201d Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady.\n\n\u201cYeah, probably,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut Dumbledore\u2019s always done things his way, hasn\u2019t he, and Moody\u2019s been getting in trouble for years, I reckon. Attacks first and asks questions later \u2014 look at his dustbins. Balderdash.\u201d\n\nThe Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole, and they climbed into the Gryffindor common room, which was crowded and noisy.\n\n\u201cShall we get our Divination stuff, then?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose,\u201d Ron groaned.\n\nThey went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts, to find Neville there alone, sitting on his bed, reading. He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody\u2019s lesson, though still not entirely normal. His eyes were rather red.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Neville?\u201d Harry asked him.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Neville, \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me. . . .\u201d\n\nHe held up the book: Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean.\n\n\u201cApparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I\u2019m really good at Herbology,\u201d Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before. \u201cHe thought I\u2019d like this.\u201d\n\nTelling Neville what Professor Sprout had said, Harry thought, had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up, for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything. It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done.\n\nHarry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room, found a table, and set to work on their predictions for the coming month. An hour later, they had made very little progress, though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols, and Harry\u2019s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney\u2019s fire.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got a clue what this lot\u2019s supposed to mean,\u201d he said, staring down at a long list of calculations.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Ron, whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration, \u201cI think it\u2019s back to the old Divination standby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 make it up?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table, dipping his pen into some ink, and starting to write.\n\n\u201cNext Monday,\u201d he said as he scribbled, \u201cI am likely to develop a cough, owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter.\u201d He looked up at Harry. \u201cYou know her \u2014 just put in loads of misery, she\u2019ll lap it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire. \u201cOkay . . . on Monday, I will be in danger of \u2014 er \u2014 burns.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you will be,\u201d said Ron darkly, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing the skrewts again on Monday. Okay, Tuesday, I\u2019ll . . . erm . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLose a treasured possession,\u201d said Harry, who was flicking through Unfogging the Future for ideas.\n\n\u201cGood one,\u201d said Ron, copying it down. \u201cBecause of . . . erm . . . Mercury. Why don\u2019t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . cool . . .\u201d said Harry, scribbling it down, \u201cbecause . . . Venus is in the twelfth house.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd on Wednesday, I think I\u2019ll come off worst in a fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAaah, I was going to have a fight. Okay, I\u2019ll lose a bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll be betting I\u2019ll win my fight. . . .\u201d\n\nThey continued to make up predictions (which grew steadily more tragic) for another hour, while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed. Crookshanks wandered over to them, leapt lightly into an empty chair, and stared inscrutably at Harry, rather as Hermione might look if she knew they weren\u2019t doing their homework properly.\n\nStaring around the room, trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadn\u2019t yet used, Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall, heads together, quills out, poring over a single piece of parchment. It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently; they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention. There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment, and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the Burrow. He had thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes, but it didn\u2019t look like that this time; if it had been, they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke. He wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament.\n\nAs Harry watched, George shook his head at Fred, scratched out something with his quill, and said, in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room, \u201cNo \u2014 that sounds like we\u2019re accusing him. Got to be careful . . .\u201d\n\nThen George looked over and saw Harry watching him. Harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions \u2014 he didn\u2019t want George to think he was eavesdropping. Shortly after that, the twins rolled up their parchment, said good night, and went off to bed.\n\nFred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other. Crookshanks arched his back, purring.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve just finished!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo have I!\u201d said Ron triumphantly, throwing down his quill.\n\nHermione sat down, laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair, and pulled Ron\u2019s predictions toward her.\n\n\u201cNot going to have a very good month, are you?\u201d she said sardonically as Crookshanks curled up in her lap.\n\n\u201cAh well, at least I\u2019m forewarned,\u201d Ron yawned.\n\n\u201cYou seem to be drowning twice,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh am I?\u201d said Ron, peering down at his predictions. \u201cI\u2019d better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit obvious you\u2019ve made these up?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d said Ron, in mock outrage. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working like house-elves here!\u201d\n\nHermione raised her eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an expression,\u201d said Ron hastily.\n\nHarry laid down his quill too, having just finished predicting his own death by decapitation.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d he asked, pointing at it.\n\n\u201cFunny you should ask,\u201d said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron. She took off the lid and showed them the contents.\n\nInside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all bearing the same letters: S.P.E.W.\n\n\u201c\u2018Spew\u2019?\u201d said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot spew,\u201d said Hermione impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s S-P-E-W. Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever heard of it,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, of course you haven\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione briskly, \u201cI\u2019ve only just started it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d said Ron in mild surprise. \u201cHow many members have you got?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 if you two join \u2014 three,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cAnd you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying \u2018spew,\u2019 do you?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cS-P-E-W!\u201d said Hermione hotly. \u201cI was going to put Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status \u2014 but it wouldn\u2019t fit. So that\u2019s the heading of our manifesto.\u201d\n\nShe brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can\u2019t believe no one\u2019s done anything about it before now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione \u2014 open your ears,\u201d said Ron loudly. \u201cThey. Like. It. They like being enslaved!\u201d\n\n\u201cOur short-term aims,\u201d said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn\u2019t heard a word, \u201care to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they\u2019re shockingly underrepresented.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how do we do all this?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cWe start by recruiting members,\u201d said Hermione happily. \u201cI thought two Sickles to join \u2014 that buys a badge \u2014 and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign. You\u2019re treasurer, Ron \u2014 I\u2019ve got you a collecting tin upstairs \u2014 and Harry, you\u2019re secretary, so you might want to write down everything I\u2019m saying now, as a record of our first meeting.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them, and Harry sat, torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look on Ron\u2019s face. The silence was broken, not by Ron, who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window. Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the moonlight, a snowy owl perched on the windowsill.\n\n\u201cHedwig!\u201d he shouted, and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window.\n\nHedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the table on top of Harry\u2019s predictions.\n\n\u201cAbout time!\u201d said Harry, hurrying after her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got an answer!\u201d said Ron excitedly, pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig\u2019s leg.\n\nHarry hastily untied it and sat down to read, whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly.\n\n\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Hermione asked breathlessly.\n\nThe letter was very short, and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry. Harry read it aloud:\n\nHarry \u2014\n\nI\u2019m flying north immediately. This news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here. If it hurts again, go straight to Dumbledore \u2014 they\u2019re saying he\u2019s got Mad-Eye out of retirement, which means he\u2019s reading the signs, even if no one else is.\n\nI\u2019ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep your eyes open, Harry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry looked up at Ron and Hermione, who stared back at him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s flying north?\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s reading what signs?\u201d said Ron, looking perplexed. \u201cHarry \u2014 what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\nFor Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolting Hedwig out of his lap.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve told him!\u201d Harry said furiously.\n\n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d said Ron in surprise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s made him think he\u2019s got to come back!\u201d said Harry, now slamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig landed on the back of Ron\u2019s chair, hooting indignantly. \u201cComing back, because he thinks I\u2019m in trouble! And there\u2019s nothing wrong with me! And I haven\u2019t got anything for you,\u201d Harry snapped at Hedwig, who was clicking her beak expectantly, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food.\u201d\n\nHedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window, cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Hermione began, in a pacifying sort of voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d said Harry shortly. \u201cSee you in the morning.\u201d\n\nUpstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his four-poster, but he didn\u2019t feel remotely tired.\n\nIf Sirius came back and got caught, it would be his, Harry\u2019s, fault. Why hadn\u2019t he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds\u2019 pain and he\u2019d had to blab. . . . If he\u2019d just had the sense to keep it to himself. . . .\n\nHe heard Ron come up into the dormitory a short while later, but did not speak to him. For a long time, Harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed. The dormitory was completely silent, and, had he been less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that the absence of Neville\u2019s usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter15": "BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG\n\n\n\n\nEarly next morning, Harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind, as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night. He got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory without waking Ron, and went back down to the deserted common room. Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his Divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter:\n\nDear Sirius,\n\nI reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep when I wrote to you last time. There\u2019s no point coming back, everything\u2019s fine here. Don\u2019t worry about me, my head feels completely normal.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe then climbed out of the portrait hole, up through the silent castle (held up only briefly by Peeves, who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving at the Owlery, which was situated at the top of West Tower.\n\nThe Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, because none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles. Hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here and there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny, and hurried over to her, sliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor.\n\nIt took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him, as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her tail. She was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night. In the end, it was Harry suggesting she might be too tired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it.\n\n\u201cJust find him, all right?\u201d Harry said, stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. \u201cBefore the dementors do.\u201d\n\nShe nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius\u2019s reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them.\n\n\u201cThat was a lie, Harry,\u201d said Hermione sharply over breakfast, when he told her and Ron what he had done. \u201cYou didn\u2019t imagine your scar hurting and you know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s not going back to Azkaban because of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrop it,\u201d said Ron sharply to Hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more, and for once, Hermione heeded him, and fell silent.\n\nHarry did his best not to worry about Sirius over the next couple of weeks. True, he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived, nor, late at night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark London street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training session. On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody\u2019s Defense Against the Dark Arts.\n\nTo their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he would be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 but you said it\u2019s illegal, Professor,\u201d said Hermione uncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. \u201cYou said \u2014 to use it against another human was \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore wants you taught what it feels like,\u201d said Moody, his magical eye swiveling onto Hermione and fixing her with an eerie, unblinking stare. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather learn the hard way \u2014 when someone\u2019s putting it on you so they can control you completely \u2014 fine by me. You\u2019re excused. Off you go.\u201d\n\nHe pointed one gnarled finger toward the door. Hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave. Harry and Ron grinned at each other. They knew Hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson.\n\nMoody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse upon them. Harry watched as, one by one, his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered only when Moody had removed it.\n\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Moody growled, \u201cyou next.\u201d\n\nHarry moved forward into the middle of the classroom, into the space that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, pointed it at Harry, and said, \u201cImperio!\u201d\n\nIt was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness. He stood there feeling immensely relaxed, only dimly aware of everyone watching him.\n\nAnd then he heard Mad-Eye Moody\u2019s voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk . . . jump onto the desk. . . .\n\nHarry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring.\n\nJump onto the desk. . . .\n\nWhy, though? Another voice had awoken in the back of his brain.\n\nStupid thing to do, really, said the voice.\n\nJump onto the desk. . . .\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think I will, thanks, said the other voice, a little more firmly . . . no, I don\u2019t really want to. . . .\n\nJump! NOW!\n\nThe next thing Harry felt was considerable pain. He had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping \u2014 the result was that he\u2019d smashed headlong into the desk, knocking it over, and, by the feeling in his legs, fractured both his kneecaps.\n\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s more like it!\u201d growled Moody\u2019s voice, and suddenly, Harry felt the empty, echoing feeling in his head disappear. He remembered exactly what was happening, and the pain in his knees seemed to double.\n\n\u201cLook at that, you lot . . . Potter fought! He fought it, and he damn near beat it! We\u2019ll try that again, Potter, and the rest of you, pay attention \u2014 watch his eyes, that\u2019s where you see it \u2014 very good, Potter, very good indeed! They\u2019ll have trouble controlling you!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way he talks,\u201d Harry muttered as he hobbled out of the Defense Against the Dark Arts class an hour later (Moody had insisted on putting Harry through his paces four times in a row, until Harry could throw off the curse entirely), \u201cyou\u2019d think we were all going to be attacked any second.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Ron, who was skipping on every alternate step. He had had much more difficulty with the curse than Harry, though Moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime. \u201cTalk about paranoid . . .\u201d Ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that Moody was definitely out of earshot and went on. \u201cNo wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry. Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted \u2018Boo\u2019 behind him on April Fools\u2019 Day? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we\u2019ve got to do?\u201d\n\nAll the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall explained why, when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of Transfiguration homework she had assigned.\n\n\u201cYou are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!\u201d she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles. \u201cYour Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take O.W.L.s till fifth year!\u201d said Dean Thomas indignantly.\n\n\u201cMaybe not, Thomas, but believe me, you need all the preparation you can get! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion. I might remind you that your pincushion, Thomas, still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin!\u201d\n\nHermione, who had turned rather pink again, seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself.\n\nHarry and Ron were deeply amused when Professor Trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next Divination class. She read out large portions of their predictions, commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them \u2014 but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next; both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes.\n\nMeanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes. They took this one seriously, as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before Christmas to see if their antidote worked. Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on Summoning Charms.\n\nEven Hagrid was adding to their workload. The Blast-Ended Skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate. Hagrid was delighted, and as part of their \u201cproject,\u201d suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior.\n\n\u201cI will not,\u201d said Draco Malfoy flatly when Hagrid had proposed this with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack. \u201cI see enough of these foul things during lessons, thanks.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s smile faded off his face.\n\n\u201cYeh\u2019ll do wha\u2019 yer told,\u201d he growled, \u201cor I\u2019ll be takin\u2019 a leaf outta Professor Moody\u2019s book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy.\u201d\n\nThe Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody\u2019s punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting. Harry, Ron, and Hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits; seeing Hagrid put down Malfoy was particularly satisfying, especially because Malfoy had done his very best to get Hagrid sacked the previous year.\n\nWhen they arrived in the entrance hall, they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there, all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron, the tallest of the three, stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two:\n\nTRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT\n\nTHE DELEGATIONS FROM BEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG WILL BE ARRIVING AT 6 O\u2019CLOCK ON FRIDAY THE 30TH OF OCTOBER. LESSONS WILL END HALF AN HOUR EARLY \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s Potions last thing on Friday! Snape won\u2019t have time to poison us all!\u201d\n\nSTUDENTS WILL RETURN THEIR BAGS AND BOOKS TO THEIR DORMITORIES AND ASSEMBLE IN FRONT OF THE CASTLE TO GREET OUR GUESTS BEFORE THE WELCOMING FEAST.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOnly a week away!\u201d said Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff, emerging from the crowd, his eyes gleaming. \u201cI wonder if Cedric knows? Think I\u2019ll go and tell him. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCedric?\u201d said Ron blankly as Ernie hurried off.\n\n\u201cDiggory,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe must be entering the tournament.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat idiot, Hogwarts champion?\u201d said Ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not an idiot. You just don\u2019t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI\u2019ve heard he\u2019s a really good student \u2014 and he\u2019s a prefect.\u201d\n\nShe spoke as though this settled the matter.\n\n\u201cYou only like him because he\u2019s handsome,\u201d said Ron scathingly.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, I don\u2019t like people just because they\u2019re handsome!\u201d said Hermione indignantly.\n\nRon gave a loud false cough, which sounded oddly like \u201cLockhart!\u201d\n\nThe appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle. During the following week, there seemed to be only one topic of conversation, no matter where Harry went: the Triwizard Tournament. Rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs: who was going to try for Hogwarts champion, what the tournament would involve, how the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang differed from themselves.\n\nHarry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extra-thorough cleaning. Several grimy portraits had been scrubbed, much to the displeasure of their subjects, who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces. The suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking, and Argus Filch, the caretaker, was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of first-year girls into hysterics.\n\nOther members of the staff seemed oddly tense too.\n\n\u201cLongbottom, kindly do not reveal that you can\u2019t even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang!\u201d Professor McGonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson, during which Neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus.\n\nWhen they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of October, they found that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts House: red with a gold lion for Gryffindor, blue with a bronze eagle for Ravenclaw, yellow with a black badger for Hufflepuff, and green with a silver serpent for Slytherin. Behind the teachers\u2019 table, the largest banner of all bore the Hogwarts coat of arms: lion, eagle, badger, and snake united around a large letter H.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sat down beside Fred and George at the Gryffindor table. Once again, and most unusually, they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices. Ron led the way over to them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bummer, all right,\u201d George was saying gloomily to Fred. \u201cBut if he won\u2019t talk to us in person, we\u2019ll have to send him the letter after all. Or we\u2019ll stuff it into his hand. He can\u2019t avoid us forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s avoiding you?\u201d said Ron, sitting down next to them.\n\n\u201cWish you would,\u201d said Fred, looking irritated at the interruption.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a bummer?\u201d Ron asked George.\n\n\u201cHaving a nosy git like you for a brother,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cYou two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cThought any more about trying to enter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasn\u2019t telling,\u201d said George bitterly. \u201cShe just told me to shut up and get on with Transfiguring my raccoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWonder what the tasks are going to be?\u201d said Ron thoughtfully. \u201cYou know, I bet we could do them, Harry. We\u2019ve done dangerous stuff before. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in front of a panel of judges, you haven\u2019t,\u201d said Fred. \u201cMcGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they\u2019ve done the tasks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are the judges?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cWell, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel,\u201d said Hermione, and everyone looked around at her, rather surprised, \u201cbecause all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.\u201d\n\nShe noticed them all looking at her and said, with her usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had, \u201cIt\u2019s all in Hogwarts: A History. Though, of course, that book\u2019s not entirely reliable. A Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title. Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts, Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d said Ron, though Harry thought he knew what was coming.\n\n\u201cHouse-elves!\u201d said Hermione, her eyes flashing. \u201cNot once, in over a thousand pages, does Hogwarts: A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves!\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs. His and Ron\u2019s lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb Hermione\u2019s determination to pursue justice for house-elves. True, both of them had paid two Sickles for a S.P.E.W. badge, but they had only done it to keep her quiet. Their Sickles had been wasted, however; if anything, they seemed to have made Hermione more vociferous. She had been badgering Harry and Ron ever since, first to wear the badges, then to persuade others to do the same, and she had also taken to rattling around the Gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses.\n\n\u201cYou do realize that your sheets are changed, your fires lit, your classrooms cleaned, and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved?\u201d she kept saying fiercely.\n\nSome people, like Neville, had paid up just to stop Hermione from glowering at them. A few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say, but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning. Many regarded the whole thing as a joke.\n\nRon now rolled his eyes at the ceiling, which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight, and Fred became extremely interested in his bacon (both twins had refused to buy a S.P.E.W. badge). George, however, leaned in toward Hermione.\n\n\u201cListen, have you ever been down in the kitchens, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d said Hermione curtly, \u201cI hardly think students are supposed to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we have,\u201d said George, indicating Fred, \u201cloads of times, to nick food. And we\u2019ve met them, and they\u2019re happy. They think they\u2019ve got the best job in the world \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re uneducated and brainwashed!\u201d Hermione began hotly, but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead, which announced the arrival of the post owls. Harry looked up at once, and saw Hedwig soaring toward him. Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and Ron watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry\u2019s shoulder, folded her wings, and held out her leg wearily.\n\nHarry pulled off Sirius\u2019s reply and offered Hedwig his bacon rinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and George were safely immersed in further discussions about the Triwizard Tournament, Harry read out Sirius\u2019s letter in a whisper to Ron and Hermione.\n\nNice try, Harry.\n\nI\u2019m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to keep me posted on everything that\u2019s going on at Hogwarts. Don\u2019t use Hedwig, keep changing owls, and don\u2019t worry about me, just watch out for yourself. Don\u2019t forget what I said about your scar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy d\u2019you have to keep changing owls?\u201d Ron asked in a low voice.\n\n\u201cHedwig\u2019ll attract too much attention,\u201d said Hermione at once. \u201cShe stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he\u2019s hiding . . . I mean, they\u2019re not native birds, are they?\u201d\n\nHarry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes, wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before. He supposed that Sirius managing to get back without being caught was something. He couldn\u2019t deny either that the idea that Sirius was much nearer was reassuring; at least he wouldn\u2019t have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote.\n\n\u201cThanks, Hedwig,\u201d he said, stroking her. She hooted sleepily, dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again, clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the Owlery.\n\nThere was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall.\n\nThe Heads of Houses were ordering their students into lines.\n\n\u201cWeasley, straighten your hat,\u201d Professor McGonagall snapped at Ron. \u201cMiss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.\u201d\n\nParvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait.\n\n\u201cFollow me, please,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cFirst years in front . . . no pushing. . . .\u201d\n\nThey filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle. It was a cold, clear evening; dusk was falling and a pale, transparent-looking moon was already shining over the Forbidden Forest. Harry, standing between Ron and Hermione in the fourth row from the front, saw Dennis Creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years.\n\n\u201cNearly six,\u201d said Ron, checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates. \u201cHow d\u2019you reckon they\u2019re coming? The train?\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cHow, then? Broomsticks?\u201d Harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so . . . not from that far away. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cA Portkey?\u201d Ron suggested. \u201cOr they could Apparate \u2014 maybe you\u2019re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds, how often do I have to tell you?\u201d said Hermione impatiently.\n\nThey scanned the darkening grounds excitedly, but nothing was moving; everything was still, silent, and quite as usual. Harry was starting to feel cold. He wished they\u2019d hurry up. . . . Maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic entrance. . . . He remembered what Mr. Weasley had said back at the campsite before the Quidditch World Cup: \u201calways the same \u2014 we can\u2019t resist showing off when we get together. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then Dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers \u2014\n\n\u201cAha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d said many students eagerly, all looking in different directions.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d yelled a sixth year, pointing over the forest.\n\nSomething large, much larger than a broomstick \u2014 or, indeed, a hundred broomsticks \u2014 was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle, growing larger all the time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dragon!\u201d shrieked one of the first years, losing her head completely.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid . . . it\u2019s a flying house!\u201d said Dennis Creevey.\n\nDennis\u2019s guess was closer. . . . As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powder-blue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant.\n\nThe front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tremendous speed \u2014 then, with an almighty crash that made Neville jump backward onto a Slytherin fifth year\u2019s foot, the horses\u2019 hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. A second later, the carriage landed too, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes.\n\nHarry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) before it opened.\n\nA boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent forward, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor, and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully. Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage \u2014 a shoe the size of a child\u2019s sled \u2014 followed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life. The size of the carriage, and of the horses, was immediately explained. A few people gasped.\n\nHarry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life, and that was Hagrid; he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights. Yet somehow \u2014 maybe simply because he was used to Hagrid \u2014 this woman (now at the foot of the steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd) seemed even more unnaturally large. As she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; and a rather beaky nose. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.\n\nDumbledore started to clap; the students, following his lead, broke into applause too, many of them standing on tiptoe, the better to look at this woman.\n\nHer face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward Dumbledore, extending a glittering hand. Dumbledore, though tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it.\n\n\u201cMy dear Madame Maxime,\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbly-dorr,\u201d said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. \u201cI \u2019ope I find you well?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn excellent form, I thank you,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cMy pupils,\u201d said Madame Maxime, waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her.\n\nHarry, whose attention had been focused completely upon Madame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls, all, by the look of them, in their late teens, had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime. They were shivering, which was unsurprising, given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk, and none of them were wearing cloaks. A few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads. From what Harry could see of them (they were standing in Madame Maxime\u2019s enormous shadow), they were staring up at Hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces.\n\n\u201c\u2019As Karkaroff arrived yet?\u201d Madame Maxime asked.\n\n\u201cHe should be here any moment,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cWould you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?\u201d\n\n\u201cWarm up, I think,\u201d said Madame Maxime. \u201cBut ze \u2019orses \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cthe moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other \u2014 er \u2014 charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cSkrewts,\u201d Ron muttered to Harry, grinning.\n\n\u201cMy steeds require \u2014 er \u2014 forceful \u2019andling,\u201d said Madame Maxime, looking as though she doubted whether any Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts could be up to the job. \u201cZey are very strong. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Madame Maxime, bowing slightly. \u201cWill you please inform zis \u2019Agrid zat ze \u2019orses drink only single-malt whiskey?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be attended to,\u201d said Dumbledore, also bowing.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Madame Maxime imperiously to her students, and the Hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps.\n\n\u201cHow big d\u2019you reckon Durmstrang\u2019s horses are going to be?\u201d Seamus Finnigan said, leaning around Lavender and Parvati to address Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, if they\u2019re any bigger than this lot, even Hagrid won\u2019t be able to handle them,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThat\u2019s if he hasn\u2019t been attacked by his skrewts. Wonder what\u2019s up with them?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ve escaped,\u201d said Ron hopefully.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t say that,\u201d said Hermione with a shudder. \u201cImagine that lot loose on the grounds. . . .\u201d\n\nThey stood, shivering slightly now, waiting for the Durmstrang party to arrive. Most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky. For a few minutes, the silence was broken only by Madame Maxime\u2019s huge horses snorting and stamping. But then \u2014\n\n\u201cCan you hear something?\u201d said Ron suddenly.\n\nHarry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking sound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed. . . .\n\n\u201cThe lake!\u201d yelled Lee Jordan, pointing down at it. \u201cLook at the lake!\u201d\n\nFrom their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water \u2014 except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all. Some disturbance was taking place deep in the center; great bubbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the muddy banks \u2014 and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a whirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lake\u2019s floor. . . .\n\nWhat seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool . . . and then Harry saw the rigging. . . .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mast!\u201d he said to Ron and Hermione.\n\nSlowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in the moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though it were a resurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes. Finally, with a great sloshing noise, the ship emerged entirely, bobbing on the turbulent water, and began to glide toward the bank. A few moments later, they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank.\n\nPeople were disembarking; they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the ship\u2019s portholes. All of them, Harry noticed, seemed to be built along the lines of Crabbe and Goyle . . . but then, as they drew nearer, walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, matted fur. But the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort: sleek and silver, like his hair.\n\n\u201cDumbledore!\u201d he called heartily as he walked up the slope. \u201cHow are you, my dear fellow, how are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,\u201d Dumbledore replied.\n\nKarkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like Dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his goatee (finishing in a small curl) did not entirely hide his rather weak chin. When he reached Dumbledore, he shook hands with both of his own.\n\n\u201cDear old Hogwarts,\u201d he said, looking up at the castle and smiling; his teeth were rather yellow, and Harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd. \u201cHow good it is to be here, how good. . . . Viktor, come along, into the warmth . . . you don\u2019t mind, Dumbledore? Viktor has a slight head cold. . . .\u201d\n\nKarkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As the boy passed, Harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He didn\u2019t need the punch on the arm Ron gave him, or the hiss in his ear, to recognize that profile.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 it\u2019s Krum!\u201d"}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter16": "THE GOBLET OF FIRE\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang. \u201cKrum, Harry! Viktor Krum!\u201d\n\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Ron, he\u2019s only a Quidditch player,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cOnly a Quidditch player?\u201d Ron said, looking at her as though he couldn\u2019t believe his ears. \u201cHermione \u2014 he\u2019s one of the best Seekers in the world! I had no idea he was still at school!\u201d\n\nAs they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts students heading for the Great Hall, Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of Krum\u2019s head. Several sixth-year girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked \u2014\n\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t believe it, I haven\u2019t got a single quill on me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think he\u2019d sign my hat in lipstick?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally,\u201d Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls, now squabbling over the lipstick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting his autograph if I can,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a quill, have you, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope, they\u2019re upstairs in my bag,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThey walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down. Ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit. The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table. They were looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces. Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that cold,\u201d said Hermione defensively. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they bring cloaks?\u201d\n\n\u201cOver here! Come and sit over here!\u201d Ron hissed. \u201cOver here! Hermione, budge up, make a space \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late,\u201d said Ron bitterly.\n\nViktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the Slytherin table. Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle looking very smug about this. As he watched, Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,\u201d said Ron scathingly. \u201cI bet Krum can see right through him, though . . . bet he gets people fawning over him all the time. . . . Where d\u2019you reckon they\u2019re going to sleep? We could offer him a space in our dormitory, Harry . . . I wouldn\u2019t mind giving him my bed, I could kip on a camp bed.\u201d\n\nHermione snorted.\n\n\u201cThey look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them, apparently impressed.\n\nUp at the staff table, Filch, the caretaker, was adding chairs. He was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion. Harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs, two on either side of Dumbledore\u2019s.\n\n\u201cBut there are only two extra people,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhy\u2019s Filch putting out four chairs, who else is coming?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d said Ron vaguely. He was still staring avidly at Krum.\n\nWhen all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats. Last in line were Professor Dumbledore, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime. When their headmistress appeared, the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their feet. A few of the Hogwarts students laughed. The Beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed, however, and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore\u2019s left-hand side. Dumbledore remained standing, and a silence fell over the Great Hall.\n\n\u201cGood evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and \u2014 most particularly \u2014 guests,\u201d said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. \u201cI have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.\u201d\n\nOne of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s making you stay!\u201d Hermione whispered, bristling at her.\n\n\u201cThe tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI now invite you all to eat, drink, and make yourselves at home!\u201d\n\nHe sat down, and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation.\n\nThe plates in front of them filled with food as usual. The house-elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen, including several that were definitely foreign.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding.\n\n\u201cBouillabaisse,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cBless you,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s French,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cI had it on holiday summer before last. It\u2019s very nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it,\u201d said Ron, helping himself to black pudding.\n\nThe Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual, even though there were barely twenty additional students there; perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the Hogwarts robes. Now that they had removed their furs, the Durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred.\n\nHagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast. He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry, Ron, and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand.\n\n\u201cSkrewts doing all right, Hagrid?\u201d Harry called.\n\n\u201cThrivin\u2019,\u201d Hagrid called back happily.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just bet they are,\u201d said Ron quietly. \u201cLooks like they\u2019ve finally found a food they like, doesn\u2019t it? Hagrid\u2019s fingers.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, a voice said, \u201cExcuse me, are you wanting ze bouillabaisse?\u201d\n\nIt was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore\u2019s speech. She had finally removed her muffler. A long sheet of silvery-blonde hair fell almost to her waist. She had large, deep blue eyes, and very white, even teeth.\n\nRon went purple. He stared up at her, opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise.\n\n\u201cYeah, have it,\u201d said Harry, pushing the dish toward the girl.\n\n\u201cYou \u2019ave finished wiz it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Ron said breathlessly. \u201cYeah, it was excellent.\u201d\n\nThe girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw table. Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before. Harry started to laugh. The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a veela!\u201d he said hoarsely to Harry.\n\n\u201cOf course she isn\u2019t!\u201d said Hermione tartly. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot!\u201d\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t entirely right about that. As the girl crossed the Hall, many boys\u2019 heads turned, and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless, just like Ron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s not a normal girl!\u201d said Ron, leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her. \u201cThey don\u2019t make them like that at Hogwarts!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey make them okay at Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry without thinking. Cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve both put your eyes back in,\u201d said Hermione briskly, \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to see who\u2019s just arrived.\u201d\n\nShe was pointing up at the staff table. The two remaining empty seats had just been filled. Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff\u2019s other side, while Mr. Crouch, Percy\u2019s boss, was next to Madame Maxime.\n\n\u201cWhat are they doing here?\u201d said Harry in surprise.\n\n\u201cThey organized the Triwizard Tournament, didn\u2019t they?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.\u201d\n\nWhen the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too. Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely, then moved it carefully a few inches to his right, so that it would be clearly visible from the Ravenclaw table. The girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough, however, and did not come over to get it.\n\nOnce the golden plates had been wiped clean, Dumbledore stood up again. A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now. Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was coming. Several seats down from them, Fred and George were leaning forward, staring at Dumbledore with great concentration.\n\n\u201cThe moment has come,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces. \u201cThe Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d Harry muttered.\n\nRon shrugged.\n\n\u201c\u2014 just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year. But first, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr. Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation\u201d \u2014 there was a smattering of polite applause \u2014 \u201cand Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.\u201d\n\nThere was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch, perhaps because of his fame as a Beater, or simply because he looked so much more likable. He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand. Bartemius Crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced. Remembering him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in wizard\u2019s robes. His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to Dumbledore\u2019s long white hair and beard.\n\n\u201cMr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament,\u201d Dumbledore continued, \u201cand they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions\u2019 efforts.\u201d\n\nAt the mention of the word \u201cchampions,\u201d the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, \u201cThe casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.\u201d\n\nFilch, who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels. It looked extremely old. A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students; Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his head hardly rose above anyone else\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,\u201d said Dumbledore as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him, \u201cand they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways . . . their magical prowess \u2014 their daring \u2014 their powers of deduction \u2014 and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.\u201d\n\nAt this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing.\n\n\u201cAs you know, three champions compete in the tournament,\u201d Dumbledore went on calmly, \u201cone from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup. The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector: the Goblet of Fire.\u201d\n\nDumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue-white flames.\n\nDumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it, where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall.\n\n\u201cAnybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Halloween, the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight, where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that no underage student yields to temptation,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cI will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall. Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line.\n\n\u201cFinally, I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly. Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end. The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet. Now, I think it is time for bed. Good night to you all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Age Line!\u201d Fred Weasley said, his eyes glinting, as they all made their way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall. \u201cWell, that should be fooled by an Aging Potion, shouldn\u2019t it? And once your name\u2019s in that goblet, you\u2019re laughing \u2014 it can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re seventeen or not!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cwe just haven\u2019t learned enough . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d said George shortly. \u201cYou\u2019ll try and get in, won\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry thought briefly of Dumbledore\u2019s insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name, but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again. . . . He wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the Age Line. . . .\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d said Ron, who wasn\u2019t listening to a word of this conversation, but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum. \u201cDumbledore didn\u2019t say where the Durmstrang people are sleeping, did he?\u201d\n\nBut this query was answered almost instantly; they were level with the Slytherin table now, and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students.\n\n\u201cBack to the ship, then,\u201d he was saying. \u201cViktor, how are you feeling? Did you eat enough? Should I send for some mulled wine from the kitchens?\u201d\n\nHarry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on.\n\n\u201cProfessor, I vood like some vine,\u201d said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t offering it to you, Poliakoff,\u201d snapped Karkaroff, his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant. \u201cI notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again, disgusting boy \u2014\u201d\n\nKarkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors, reaching them at exactly the same moment as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry stopped to let him walk through first.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Karkaroff carelessly, glancing at him.\n\nAnd then Karkaroff froze. He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. Behind their headmaster, the students from Durmstrang came to a halt too. Karkaroff\u2019s eyes moved slowly up Harry\u2019s face and fixed upon his scar. The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s Harry Potter,\u201d said a growling voice from behind them.\n\nProfessor Karkaroff spun around. Mad-Eye Moody was standing there, leaning heavily on his staff, his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang headmaster.\n\nThe color drained from Karkaroff\u2019s face as Harry watched. A terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d he said, staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d said Moody grimly. \u201cAnd unless you\u2019ve got anything to say to Potter, Karkaroff, you might want to move. You\u2019re blocking the doorway.\u201d\n\nIt was true; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them, looking over one another\u2019s shoulders to see what was causing the holdup.\n\nWithout another word, Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him. Moody watched him until he was out of sight, his magical eye fixed upon his back, a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face.\n\nAs the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends. When they went down into the entrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction.\n\n\u201cAnyone put their name in yet?\u201d Ron asked a third-year girl eagerly.\n\n\u201cAll the Durmstrang lot,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen anyone from Hogwarts yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBet some of them put it in last night after we\u2019d all gone to bed,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI would\u2019ve if it had been me . . . wouldn\u2019t have wanted everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?\u201d\n\nSomeone laughed behind Harry. Turning, he saw Fred, George, and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase, all three of them looking extremely excited.\n\n\u201cDone it,\u201d Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \u201cJust taken it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThe Aging Potion, dung brains,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cOne drop each,\u201d said George, rubbing his hands together with glee. \u201cWe only need to be a few months older.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to split the thousand Galleons between the three of us if one of us wins,\u201d said Lee, grinning broadly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure this is going to work, you know,\u201d said Hermione warningly. \u201cI\u2019m sure Dumbledore will have thought of this.\u201d\n\nFred, George, and Lee ignored her.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Fred said to the other two, quivering with excitement. \u201cC\u2019mon, then \u2014 I\u2019ll go first \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry watched, fascinated, as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred Weasley \u2014 Hogwarts. Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there, rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty-foot drop. Then, with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him, he took a great breath and stepped over the line.\n\nFor a split second Harry thought it had worked \u2014 George certainly thought so, for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred \u2014 but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical long white beards.\n\nThe entrance hall rang with laughter. Even Fred and George joined in, once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other\u2019s beards.\n\n\u201cI did warn you,\u201d said a deep, amused voice, and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall. He surveyed Fred and George, his eyes twinkling. \u201cI suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey. She is already tending to Miss Fawcett, of Ravenclaw, and Mr. Summers, of Hufflepuff, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too. Though I must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.\u201d\n\nFred and George set off for the hospital wing, accompanied by Lee, who was howling with laughter, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, also chortling, went in to breakfast.\n\nThe decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning. As it was Halloween, a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling, while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner. Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus, who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in,\u201d Dean told Harry. \u201cThat big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth.\u201d\n\nHarry, who had played Quidditch against Warrington, shook his head in disgust.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have a Slytherin champion!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory,\u201d said Seamus contemptuously. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t have thought he\u2019d have wanted to risk his good looks.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d said Hermione suddenly.\n\nPeople were cheering out in the entrance hall. They all swiveled around in their seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall, grinning in an embarrassed sort of way. A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Angelina came over to them, sat down, and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve done it! Just put my name in!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d said Ron, looking impressed.\n\n\u201cAre you seventeen, then?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course she is, can\u2019t see a beard, can you?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI had my birthday last week,\u201d said Angelina.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad someone from Gryffindor\u2019s entering,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI really hope you get it, Angelina!\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Hermione,\u201d said Angelina, smiling at her.\n\n\u201cYeah, better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory,\u201d said Seamus, causing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we going to do today, then?\u201d Ron asked Harry and Hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been down to visit Hagrid yet,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Ron, \u201cjust as long as he doesn\u2019t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts.\u201d\n\nA look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just realized \u2014 I haven\u2019t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet!\u201d she said brightly. \u201cWait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it with her?\u201d said Ron, exasperated, as Hermione ran away up the marble staircase.\n\n\u201cHey, Ron,\u201d said Harry suddenly. \u201cIt\u2019s your friend . . .\u201d\n\nThe students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds, among them, the veela-girl. Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly.\n\nMadame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-white flames. As each name entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon\u2019ll happen to the ones who aren\u2019t chosen?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire. \u201cReckon they\u2019ll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHang around, I suppose. . . . Madame Maxime\u2019s staying to judge, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nWhen all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again.\n\n\u201cWhere are they sleeping, then?\u201d said Ron, moving toward the front doors and staring after them.\n\nA loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione\u2019s reappearance with the box of S.P.E.W. badges.\n\n\u201cOh good, hurry up,\u201d said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime.\n\nAs they neared Hagrid\u2019s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons\u2019 sleeping quarters was solved. The gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid\u2019s front door, and the students were climbing back inside it. The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it.\n\nHarry knocked on Hagrid\u2019s door, and Fang\u2019s booming barks answered instantly.\n\n\u201c\u2019Bout time!\u201d said Hagrid, when he\u2019d flung open the door. \u201cThought you lot\u2019d forgotten where I live!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really busy, Hag \u2014\u201d Hermione started to say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words.\n\nHagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie. This wasn\u2019t the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease. It was now slicked down into two bunches \u2014 perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill\u2019s, but found he had too much hair. The look didn\u2019t really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, \u201cErm \u2014 where are the skrewts?\u201d\n\n\u201cOut by the pumpkin patch,\u201d said Hagrid happily. \u201cThey\u2019re gettin\u2019 massive, mus\u2019 be nearly three foot long now. On\u2019y trouble is, they\u2019ve started killin\u2019 each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, really?\u201d said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid\u2019s odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid sadly. \u201c\u2019S\u2019 okay, though, I\u2019ve got \u2019em in separate boxes now. Still got abou\u2019 twenty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s lucky,\u201d said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.\n\nHagrid\u2019s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt. A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling. They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament. Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were.\n\n\u201cYou wait,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cYou jus\u2019 wait. Yer going ter see some stuff yeh\u2019ve never seen before. Firs\u2019 task . . . ah, but I\u2019m not supposed ter say.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on, Hagrid!\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019 want ter spoil it fer yeh,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cBut it\u2019s gonna be spectacular, I\u2019ll tell yeh that. Them champions\u2019re going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I\u2019d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!\u201d\n\nThey ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn\u2019t eat much \u2014 Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites. However, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet.\n\nA light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves \u2014 for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W. when she showed him her badges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be doin\u2019 \u2019em an unkindness, Hermione,\u201d he said gravely, threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn. \u201cIt\u2019s in their nature ter look after humans, that\u2019s what they like, see? Yeh\u2019d be makin\u2019 \u2019em unhappy ter take away their work, an\u2019 insultin\u2019 \u2019em if yeh tried ter pay \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry set Dobby free, and he was over the moon about it!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd we heard he\u2019s asking for wages now!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, yeh get weirdos in every breed. I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 there isn\u2019t the odd elf who\u2019d take freedom, but yeh\u2019ll never persuade most of \u2019em ter do it \u2014 no, nothin\u2019 doin\u2019, Hermione.\u201d\n\nHermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket.\n\nBy half past five it was growing dark, and Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast \u2014 and, more important, the announcement of the school champions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with yeh,\u201d said Hagrid, putting away his darning. \u201cJus\u2019 give us a sec.\u201d\n\nHagrid got up, went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed, and began searching for something inside it. They didn\u2019t pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils. Coughing, Ron said, \u201cHagrid, what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d said Hagrid, turning around with a large bottle in his hand. \u201cDon\u2019 yeh like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that aftershave?\u201d said Hermione in a slightly choked voice.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 eau de cologne,\u201d Hagrid muttered. He was blushing. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a bit much,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019ll go take it off, hang on . . .\u201d\n\nHe stumped out of the cabin, and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window.\n\n\u201cEau de cologne?\u201d said Hermione in amazement. \u201cHagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s with the hair and the suit?\u201d said Harry in an undertone.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d said Ron suddenly, pointing out of the window.\n\nHagrid had just straightened up and turned \u2019round. If he had been blushing before, it was nothing to what he was doing now. Getting to their feet very cautiously, so that Hagrid wouldn\u2019t spot them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage, clearly about to set off for the feast too. They couldn\u2019t hear what Hagrid was saying, but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt, misty-eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before \u2014 when he had been looking at the baby dragon, Norbert.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going up to the castle with her!\u201d said Hermione indignantly. \u201cI thought he was waiting for us!\u201d\n\nWithout so much as a backward glance at his cabin, Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime, the Beauxbatons students following in their wake, jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.\n\n\u201cHe fancies her!\u201d said Ron incredulously. \u201cWell, if they end up having children, they\u2019ll be setting a world record \u2014 bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton.\u201d\n\nThey let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them. It was surprisingly dark outside. Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves, they set off up the sloping lawns.\n\n\u201cOoh it\u2019s them, look!\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\nThe Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake. Viktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff, and the other Durmstrang students were straggling along behind them. Ron watched Krum excitedly, but Krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of Hermione, Ron, and Harry and proceeded through them.\n\nWhen they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full. The Goblet of Fire had been moved; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore\u2019s empty chair at the teachers\u2019 table. Fred and George \u2014 clean-shaven again \u2014 seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well.\n\n\u201cHope it\u2019s Angelina,\u201d said Fred as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down.\n\n\u201cSo do I!\u201d said Hermione breathlessly. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll soon know!\u201d\n\nThe Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual. Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days, Harry didn\u2019t seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally. Like everyone else in the Hall, judging by the constantly craning necks, the impatient expressions on every face, the fidgeting, and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet, Harry simply wanted the plates to clear, and to hear who had been selected as champions.\n\nAt long last, the golden plates returned to their original spotless state; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall, which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet. On either side of him, Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone. Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students. Mr. Crouch, however, looked quite uninterested, almost bored.\n\n\u201cWell, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions\u2019 names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber\u201d \u2014 he indicated the door behind the staff table \u2014 \u201cwhere they will be receiving their first instructions.\u201d\n\nHe took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting. . . . A few people kept checking their watches. . . .\n\n\u201cAny second,\u201d Lee Jordan whispered, two seats away from Harry.\n\nThe flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it \u2014 the whole room gasped.\n\nDumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm\u2019s length, so that he could read it by the light of the flames, which had turned back to blue-white.\n\n\u201cThe champion for Durmstrang,\u201d he read, in a strong, clear voice, \u201cwill be Viktor Krum.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo surprises there!\u201d yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall. Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore; he turned right, walked along the staff table, and disappeared through the door into the next chamber.\n\n\u201cBravo, Viktor!\u201d boomed Karkaroff, so loudly that everyone could hear him, even over all the applause. \u201cKnew you had it in you!\u201d\n\nThe clapping and chatting died down. Now everyone\u2019s attention was focused again on the goblet, which, seconds later, turned red once more. A second piece of parchment shot out of it, propelled by the flames.\n\n\u201cThe champion for Beauxbatons,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cis Fleur Delacour!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s her, Ron!\u201d Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet, shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair, and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables.\n\n\u201cOh look, they\u2019re all disappointed,\u201d Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. \u201cDisappointed\u201d was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.\n\nWhen Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber, silence fell again, but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it. The Hogwarts champion next . . .\n\nAnd the Goblet of Fire turned red once more; sparks showered out of it; the tongue of flame shot high into the air, and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment.\n\n\u201cThe Hogwarts champion,\u201d he called, \u201cis Cedric Diggory!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers\u2019 table. Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again.\n\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down. \u201cWell, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking, and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him.\n\nThe fire in the goblet had just turned red again. Sparks were flying out of it. A long flame shot suddenly into the air, and borne upon it was another piece of parchment.\n\nAutomatically, it seemed, Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment. He held it out and stared at the name written upon it. There was a long pause, during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands, and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out \u2014\n\n\u201cHarry Potter.\u201d"}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter17": "THE FOUR CHAMPIONS\n\n\n\n\nHarry sat there, aware that every head in the Great Hall had turned to look at him. He was stunned. He felt numb. He was surely dreaming. He had not heard correctly.\n\nThere was no applause. A buzzing, as though of angry bees, was starting to fill the Hall; some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat.\n\nUp at the top table, Professor McGonagall had got to her feet and swept past Ludo Bagman and Professor Karkaroff to whisper urgently to Professor Dumbledore, who bent his ear toward her, frowning slightly.\n\nHarry turned to Ron and Hermione; beyond them, he saw the long Gryffindor table all watching him, openmouthed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t put my name in,\u201d Harry said blankly. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBoth of them stared just as blankly back.\n\nAt the top table, Professor Dumbledore had straightened up, nodding to Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter!\u201d he called again. \u201cHarry! Up here, if you please!\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Hermione whispered, giving Harry a slight push.\n\nHarry got to his feet, trod on the hem of his robes, and stumbled slightly. He set off up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. It felt like an immensely long walk; the top table didn\u2019t seem to be getting any nearer at all, and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him, as though each were a searchlight. The buzzing grew louder and louder. After what seemed like an hour, he was right in front of Dumbledore, feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him.\n\n\u201cWell . . . through the door, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. He wasn\u2019t smiling.\n\nHarry moved off along the teachers\u2019 table. Hagrid was seated right at the end. He did not wink at Harry, or wave, or give any of his usual signs of greeting. He looked completely astonished and stared at Harry as he passed like everyone else. Harry went through the door out of the Great Hall and found himself in a smaller room, lined with paintings of witches and wizards. A handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him.\n\nThe faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered. He saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it, which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache. The wizened witch started whispering in his ear.\n\nViktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour were grouped around the fire. They looked strangely impressive, silhouetted against the flames. Krum, hunched-up and brooding, was leaning against the mantelpiece, slightly apart from the other two. Cedric was standing with his hands behind his back, staring into the fire. Fleur Delacour looked around when Harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long, silvery hair.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said. \u201cDo zey want us back in ze Hall?\u201d\n\nShe thought he had come to deliver a message. Harry didn\u2019t know how to explain what had just happened. He just stood there, looking at the three champions. It struck him how very tall all of them were.\n\nThere was a sound of scurrying feet behind him, and Ludo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.\n\n\u201cExtraordinary!\u201d he muttered, squeezing Harry\u2019s arm. \u201cAbsolutely extraordinary! Gentlemen . . . lady,\u201d he added, approaching the fireside and addressing the other three. \u201cMay I introduce \u2014 incredible though it may seem \u2014 the fourth Triwizard champion?\u201d\n\nViktor Krum straightened up. His surly face darkened as he surveyed Harry. Cedric looked nonplussed. He looked from Bagman to Harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what Bagman had said. Fleur Delacour, however, tossed her hair, smiling, and said, \u201cOh, vairy funny joke, Meester Bagman.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoke?\u201d Bagman repeated, bewildered. \u201cNo, no, not at all! Harry\u2019s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire!\u201d\n\nKrum\u2019s thick eyebrows contracted slightly. Cedric was still looking politely bewildered. Fleur frowned.\n\n\u201cBut evidently zair \u2019as been a mistake,\u201d she said contemptuously to Bagman. \u201c\u2019E cannot compete. \u2019E is too young.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . it is amazing,\u201d said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry. \u201cBut, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his name\u2019s come out of the goblet . . . I mean, I don\u2019t think there can be any ducking out at this stage. . . . It\u2019s down in the rules, you\u2019re obliged . . . Harry will just have to do the best he \u2014\u201d\n\nThe door behind them opened again, and a large group of people came in: Professor Dumbledore, followed closely by Mr. Crouch, Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Snape. Harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall, before Professor McGonagall closed the door.\n\n\u201cMadame Maxime!\u201d said Fleur at once, striding over to her headmistress. \u201cZey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also!\u201d\n\nSomewhere under Harry\u2019s numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger. Little boy?\n\nMadame Maxime had drawn herself up to her full, and considerable, height. The top of her handsome head brushed the candle-filled chandelier, and her gigantic black-satin bosom swelled.\n\n\u201cWhat is ze meaning of zis, Dumbly-dorr?\u201d she said imperiously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather like to know that myself, Dumbledore,\u201d said Professor Karkaroff. He was wearing a steely smile, and his blue eyes were like chips of ice. \u201cTwo Hogwarts champions? I don\u2019t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions \u2014 or have I not read the rules carefully enough?\u201d\n\nHe gave a short and nasty laugh.\n\n\u201cC\u2019est impossible,\u201d said Madame Maxime, whose enormous hand with its many superb opals was resting upon Fleur\u2019s shoulder. \u201c\u2019Ogwarts cannot \u2019ave two champions. It is most injust.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants, Dumbledore,\u201d said Karkaroff, his steely smile still in place, though his eyes were colder than ever. \u201cOtherwise, we would, of course, have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but Potter\u2019s, Karkaroff,\u201d said Snape softly. His black eyes were alight with malice. \u201cDon\u2019t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter\u2019s determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore firmly, and Snape went quiet, though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair.\n\nProfessor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him, trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the half-moon spectacles.\n\n\u201cDid you put your name into the Goblet of Fire, Harry?\u201d he asked calmly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. He was very aware of everybody watching him closely. Snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows.\n\n\u201cDid you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you?\u201d said Professor Dumbledore, ignoring Snape.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry vehemently.\n\n\u201cAh, but of course \u2019e is lying!\u201d cried Madame Maxime. Snape was now shaking his head, his lip curling.\n\n\u201cHe could not have crossed the Age Line,\u201d said Professor McGonagall sharply. \u201cI am sure we are all agreed on that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbly-dorr must \u2019ave made a mistake wiz ze line,\u201d said Madame Maxime, shrugging.\n\n\u201cIt is possible, of course,\u201d said Dumbledore politely.\n\n\u201cDumbledore, you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake!\u201d said Professor McGonagall angrily. \u201cReally, what nonsense! Harry could not have crossed the line himself, and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him, I\u2019m sure that should be good enough for everybody else!\u201d\n\nShe shot a very angry look at Professor Snape.\n\n\u201cMr. Crouch . . . Mr. Bagman,\u201d said Karkaroff, his voice unctuous once more, \u201cyou are our \u2014 er \u2014 objective judges. Surely you will agree that this is most irregular?\u201d\n\nBagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr. Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice.\n\n\u201cWe must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Barty knows the rule book back to front,\u201d said Bagman, beaming and turning back to Karkaroff and Madame Maxime, as though the matter was now closed.\n\n\u201cI insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students,\u201d said Karkaroff. He had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now. His face wore a very ugly look indeed. \u201cYou will set up the Goblet of Fire once more, and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions. It\u2019s only fair, Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Karkaroff, it doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d said Bagman. \u201cThe Goblet of Fire\u2019s just gone out \u2014 it won\u2019t reignite until the start of the next tournament \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing!\u201d exploded Karkaroff. \u201cAfter all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now!\u201d\n\n\u201cEmpty threat, Karkaroff,\u201d growled a voice from near the door. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave your champion now. He\u2019s got to compete. They\u2019ve all got to compete. Binding magical contract, like Dumbledore said. Convenient, eh?\u201d\n\nMoody had just entered the room. He limped toward the fire, and with every right step he took, there was a loud clunk.\n\n\u201cConvenient?\u201d said Karkaroff. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand you, Moody.\u201d\n\nHarry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful, as though what Moody was saying was barely worth his notice, but his hands gave him away; they had balled themselves into fists.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d said Moody quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple, Karkaroff. Someone put Potter\u2019s name in that goblet knowing he\u2019d have to compete if it came out.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvidently, someone \u2019oo wished to give \u2019Ogwarts two bites at ze apple!\u201d said Madame Maxime.\n\n\u201cI quite agree, Madame Maxime,\u201d said Karkaroff, bowing to her. \u201cI shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anyone\u2019s got reason to complain, it\u2019s Potter,\u201d growled Moody, \u201cbut . . . funny thing . . . I don\u2019t hear him saying a word. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should \u2019e complain?\u201d burst out Fleur Delacour, stamping her foot. \u201c\u2019E \u2019as ze chance to compete, \u2019asn\u2019t \u2019e? We \u2019ave all been \u2019oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks! Ze honor for our schools! A thousand Galleons in prize money \u2014 zis is a chance many would die for!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe someone\u2019s hoping Potter is going to die for it,\u201d said Moody, with the merest trace of a growl.\n\nAn extremely tense silence followed these words. Ludo Bagman, who was looking very anxious indeed, bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said, \u201cMoody, old man . . . what a thing to say!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he hasn\u2019t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime,\u201d said Karkaroff loudly. \u201cApparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too. An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dumbledore, but no doubt you had your reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagining things, am I?\u201d growled Moody. \u201cSeeing things, eh? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy\u2019s name in that goblet. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, what evidence is zere of zat?\u201d said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands.\n\n\u201cBecause they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!\u201d said Moody. \u201cIt would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament. . . . I\u2019m guessing they submitted Potter\u2019s name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,\u201d said Karkaroff coldly, \u201cand a very ingenious theory it is \u2014 though of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock. So you\u2019ll understand if we don\u2019t take you entirely seriously. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are those who\u2019ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage,\u201d Moody retorted in a menacing voice. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to think the way Dark wizards do, Karkaroff \u2014 as you ought to remember. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAlastor!\u201d said Dumbledore warningly. Harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to, but then realized \u201cMad-Eye\u201d could hardly be Moody\u2019s real first name. Moody fell silent, though still surveying Karkaroff with satisfaction \u2014 Karkaroff\u2019s face was burning.\n\n\u201cHow this situation arose, we do not know,\u201d said Dumbledore, speaking to everyone gathered in the room. \u201cIt seems to me, however, that we have no choice but to accept it. Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the tournament. This, therefore, they will do. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, but Dumbly-dorr \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to hear it.\u201d\n\nDumbledore waited, but Madame Maxime did not speak, she merely glared. She wasn\u2019t the only one either. Snape looked furious; Karkaroff livid; Bagman, however, looked rather excited.\n\n\u201cWell, shall we crack on, then?\u201d he said, rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room. \u201cGot to give our champions their instructions, haven\u2019t we? Barty, want to do the honors?\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cinstructions. Yes . . . the first task . . .\u201d\n\nHe moved forward into the firelight. Close up, Harry thought he looked ill. There were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin, papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the Quidditch World Cup.\n\n\u201cThe first task is designed to test your daring,\u201d he told Harry, Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor, \u201cso we are not going to be telling you what it is. Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard . . . very important. . . .\n\n\u201cThe first task will take place on November the twenty-fourth, in front of the other students and the panel of judges.\n\n\u201cThe champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament. The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands. They will receive information about the second task when the first is over. Owing to the demanding and time-consuming nature of the tournament, the champions are exempted from end-of-year tests.\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch turned to look at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s all, is it, Albus?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d said Dumbledore, who was looking at Mr. Crouch with mild concern. \u201cAre you sure you wouldn\u2019t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Dumbledore, I must get back to the Ministry,\u201d said Mr. Crouch. \u201cIt is a very busy, very difficult time at the moment. . . . I\u2019ve left young Weatherby in charge. . . . Very enthusiastic . . . a little overenthusiastic, if truth be told. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cCome on, Barty, I\u2019m staying!\u201d said Bagman brightly. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening at Hogwarts now, you know, much more exciting here than at the office!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think not, Ludo,\u201d said Crouch with a touch of his old impatience.\n\n\u201cProfessor Karkaroff \u2014 Madame Maxime \u2014 a nightcap?\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nBut Madame Maxime had already put her arm around Fleur\u2019s shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room. Harry could hear them both talking very fast in French as they went off into the Great Hall. Karkaroff beckoned to Krum, and they, too, exited, though in silence.\n\n\u201cHarry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling at both of them. \u201cI am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise.\u201d\n\nHarry glanced at Cedric, who nodded, and they left together.\n\nThe Great Hall was deserted now; the candles had burned low, giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie, flickering quality.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Cedric, with a slight smile. \u201cWe\u2019re playing against each other again!\u201d\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose,\u201d said Harry. He really couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. The inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray, as though his brain had been ransacked.\n\n\u201cSo . . . tell me . . .\u201d said Cedric as they reached the entrance hall, which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the Goblet of Fire. \u201cHow did you get your name in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry, staring up at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t put it in. I was telling the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh . . . okay,\u201d said Cedric. Harry could tell Cedric didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cWell . . . see you, then.\u201d\n\nInstead of going up the marble staircase, Cedric headed for a door to its right. Harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, he started to climb the marble ones.\n\nWas anyone except Ron and Hermione going to believe him, or would they all think he\u2019d put himself in for the tournament? Yet how could anyone think that, when he was facing competitors who\u2019d had three years\u2019 more magical education than he had \u2014 when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous, but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people? Yes, he\u2019d thought about it . . . he\u2019d fantasized about it . . . but it had been a joke, really, an idle sort of dream . . . he\u2019d never really, seriously considered entering. . . .\n\nBut someone else had considered it . . . someone else had wanted him in the tournament, and had made sure he was entered. Why? To give him a treat? He didn\u2019t think so, somehow. . . .\n\nTo see him make a fool of himself? Well, they were likely to get their wish. . . .\n\nBut to get him killed?\n\nWas Moody just being his usual paranoid self? Couldn\u2019t someone have put Harry\u2019s name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? Did anyone really want him dead?\n\nHarry was able to answer that at once. Yes, someone wanted him dead, someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old . . . Lord Voldemort. But how could Voldemort have ensured that Harry\u2019s name got into the Goblet of Fire? Voldemort was supposed to be far away, in some distant country, in hiding, alone . . . feeble and powerless. . . .\n\nYet in that dream he had had, just before he had awoken with his scar hurting, Voldemort had not been alone . . . he had been talking to Wormtail . . . plotting Harry\u2019s murder. . . .\n\nHarry got a shock to find himself facing the Fat Lady already. He had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him. It was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame. The wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbor\u2019s painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the Fat Lady. She must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him. Both she and the Fat Lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d said the Fat Lady, \u201cViolet\u2019s just told me everything. Who\u2019s just been chosen as school champion, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cBalderdash,\u201d said Harry dully.\n\n\u201cIt most certainly isn\u2019t!\u201d said the pale witch indignantly.\n\n\u201cNo, no, Vi, it\u2019s the password,\u201d said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she swung forward on her hinges to let Harry into the common room.\n\nThe blast of noise that met Harry\u2019s ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward. Next thing he knew, he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands, and was facing the whole of Gryffindor House, all of whom were screaming, applauding, and whistling.\n\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve told us you\u2019d entered!\u201d bellowed Fred; he looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed.\n\n\u201cHow did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!\u201d roared George.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Angelina had now swooped down upon him; \u201cOh if it couldn\u2019t be me, at least it\u2019s a Gryffindor \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match, Harry!\u201d shrieked Katie Bell, another of the Gryffindor Chasers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got food, Harry, come and have some \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry, I had enough at the feast \u2014\u201d\n\nBut nobody wanted to hear that he wasn\u2019t hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn\u2019t put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn\u2019t at all in the mood to celebrate. . . . Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn\u2019t get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands. . . . Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore\u2019s Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet. . . .\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, over and over again, \u201cI don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d\n\nBut for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired!\u201d he bellowed finally, after nearly half an hour. \u201cNo, seriously, George \u2014 I\u2019m going to bed \u2014\u201d\n\nHe wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could.\n\nTo his great relief, he found Ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed. He looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cOh hello,\u201d said Ron.\n\nHe was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, congratulations?\u201d said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace.\n\n\u201cWell . . . no one else got across the Age Line,\u201d said Ron. \u201cNot even Fred and George. What did you use \u2014 the Invisibility Cloak?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Invisibility Cloak wouldn\u2019t have got me over that line,\u201d said Harry slowly.\n\n\u201cOh right,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI thought you might\u2019ve told me if it was the Cloak . . . because it would\u2019ve covered both of us, wouldn\u2019t it? But you found another way, did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI didn\u2019t put my name in that goblet. Someone else must\u2019ve done it.\u201d\n\nRon raised his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cWhat would they do that for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Harry. He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, \u201cTo kill me.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re bothering to lie, you didn\u2019t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady\u2019s, that Violet, she\u2019s already told us all Dumbledore\u2019s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don\u2019t have to do end-of-year tests either. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t put my name in that goblet!\u201d said Harry, starting to feel angry.\n\n\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d said Ron, in exactly the same skeptical tone as Cedric. \u201cOnly you said this morning you\u2019d have done it last night, and no one would\u2019ve seen you. . . . I\u2019m not stupid, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing a really good impression of it,\u201d Harry snapped.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. \u201cYou want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you\u2019ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something.\u201d\n\nHe wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter18": "THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS\n\n\n\n\nWhen Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him \u2014 only to find that Ron\u2019s bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.\n\nHarry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room. The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. \u201cI brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said Harry gratefully.\n\nThey went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.\n\n\u201cWell, of course I knew you hadn\u2019t entered yourself,\u201d she said when he\u2019d finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall. \u201cThe look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who did put it in? Because Moody\u2019s right, Harry . . . I don\u2019t think any student could have done it . . . they\u2019d never be able to fool the goblet, or get over Dumbledore\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you seen Ron?\u201d Harry interrupted.\n\nHermione hesitated.\n\n\u201cErm . . . yes . . . he was at breakfast,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDoes he still think I entered myself?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . no, I don\u2019t think so . . . not really,\u201d said Hermione awkwardly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, \u2018not really\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Harry, isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Hermione said despairingly. \u201cHe\u2019s jealous!\u201d\n\n\u201cJealous?\u201d Harry said incredulously. \u201cJealous of what? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Hermione patiently, \u201cit\u2019s always you who gets all the attention, you know it is. I know it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d she added quickly, seeing Harry open his mouth furiously. \u201cI know you don\u2019t ask for it . . . but \u2014 well \u2014 you know, Ron\u2019s got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you\u2019re his best friend, and you\u2019re really famous \u2014 he\u2019s always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time too many. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Harry bitterly. \u201cReally great. Tell him from me I\u2019ll swap any time he wants. Tell him from me he\u2019s welcome to it. . . . People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not telling him anything,\u201d Hermione said shortly. \u201cTell him yourself. It\u2019s the only way to sort this out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running around after him trying to make him grow up!\u201d Harry said, so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll believe I\u2019m not enjoying myself once I\u2019ve got my neck broken or \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d said Hermione quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny at all.\u201d She looked extremely anxious. \u201cHarry, I\u2019ve been thinking \u2014 you know what we\u2019ve got to do, don\u2019t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, give Ron a good kick up the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWrite to Sirius. You\u2019ve got to tell him what\u2019s happened. He asked you to keep him posted on everything that\u2019s going on at Hogwarts. . . . It\u2019s almost as if he expected something like this to happen. I brought some parchment and a quill out with me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCome off it,\u201d said Harry, looking around to check that they couldn\u2019t be overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted. \u201cHe came back to the country just because my scar twinged. He\u2019ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone\u2019s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d want you to tell him,\u201d said Hermione sternly. \u201cHe\u2019s going to find out anyway \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, this isn\u2019t going to be kept quiet,\u201d said Hermione, very seriously. \u201cThis tournament\u2019s famous, and you\u2019re famous. I\u2019ll be really surprised if there isn\u2019t anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing. . . . You\u2019re already in half the books about You-Know-Who, you know . . . and Sirius would rather hear it from you, I know he would.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll write to him,\u201d said Harry, throwing his last piece of toast into the lake. They both stood and watched it floating there for a moment, before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface. Then they returned to the castle.\n\n\u201cWhose owl am I going to use?\u201d Harry said as they climbed the stairs. \u201cHe told me not to use Hedwig again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk Ron if you can borrow \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking Ron for anything,\u201d Harry said flatly.\n\n\u201cWell, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use them,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThey went up to the Owlery. Hermione gave Harry a piece of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls, while Harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter.\n\nDear Sirius,\n\nYou told me to keep you posted on what\u2019s happening at Hogwarts, so here goes \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but the Triwizard Tournament\u2019s happening this year and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth champion. I don\u2019t know who put my name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn\u2019t. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night, but he couldn\u2019t think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote,\n\nHope you\u2019re okay, and Buckbeak \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFinished,\u201d he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig came fluttering down onto his shoulder and held out her leg.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t use you,\u201d Harry told her, looking around for the school owls. \u201cI\u2019ve got to use one of these. . . .\u201d\n\nHedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach.\n\n\u201cFirst Ron, then you,\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d\n\nIf Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons \u2014 and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed.\n\nThe Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion\u2019s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray \u2014 though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry\u2019s grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn\u2019t talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him \u2014 but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.\n\nHe would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing the Slytherins too \u2014 the first time he would come face-to-face with them since becoming champion.\n\nPredictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid\u2019s cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place.\n\n\u201cAh, look, boys, it\u2019s the champion,\u201d he said to Crabbe and Goyle the moment he got within earshot of Harry. \u201cGot your autograph books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he\u2019s going to be around much longer. . . . Half the Triwizard champions have died . . . how long d\u2019you reckon you\u2019re going to last, Potter? Ten minutes into the first task\u2019s my bet.\u201d\n\nCrabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class\u2019s horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely.\n\n\u201cTake this thing for a walk?\u201d he repeated in disgust, staring into one of the boxes. \u201cAnd where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?\u201d\n\n\u201cRoun\u2019 the middle,\u201d said Hagrid, demonstrating. \u201cEr \u2014 yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus\u2019 as an extra precaution, like. Harry \u2014 you come here an\u2019 help me with this big one. . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s real intention, however, was to talk to Harry away from the rest of the class. He waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, \u201cSo \u2014 yer competin\u2019, Harry. In the tournament. School champion.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the champions,\u201d Harry corrected him.\n\nHagrid\u2019s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows.\n\n\u201cNo idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe I didn\u2019t do it, then?\u201d said Harry, concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid\u2019s words.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course I do,\u201d Hagrid grunted. \u201cYeh say it wasn\u2019 you, an\u2019 I believe yeh \u2014 an\u2019 Dumbledore believes yer, an\u2019 all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWish I knew who did do it,\u201d said Harry bitterly.\n\nThe pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over three feet long, and extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor. They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs \u2014 but still without recognizable heads or eyes. They had become immensely strong and very hard to control.\n\n\u201cLook like they\u2019re havin\u2019 fun, don\u2019 they?\u201d Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren\u2019t; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts\u2019 ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.\n\n\u201cAh, I don\u2019 know, Harry,\u201d Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face. \u201cSchool champion . . . everythin\u2019 seems ter happen ter you, doesn\u2019 it?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to him . . . that was more or less what Hermione had said as they had walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to her, that Ron was no longer talking to him.\n\nThe next few days were some of Harry\u2019s worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had been on his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school\u2019s behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn\u2019t going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn\u2019t want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.\n\nHe could understand the Hufflepuffs\u2019 attitude, even if he didn\u2019t like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins \u2014 he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter-House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.\n\nThen there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum. Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen to get Krum\u2019s autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime.\n\nMeanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick\u2019s class that he was given extra homework \u2014 the only person to get any, apart from Neville.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not that difficult, Harry,\u201d Hermione tried to reassure him as they left Flitwick\u2019s class \u2014 she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all lesson, as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and lunascopes. \u201cYou just weren\u2019t concentrating properly \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWonder why that was,\u201d said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large Blast-Ended Skrewt. \u201cStill \u2014 never mind, eh? Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon. . . .\u201d\n\nDouble Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days it was nothing short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed determined to punish Harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing Harry could imagine. He had already struggled through one Friday\u2019s worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning \u201cignore them, ignore them, ignore them\u201d under her breath, and he couldn\u2019t see why today should be any better.\n\nWhen he and Hermione arrived at Snape\u2019s dungeon after lunch, they found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes. For one wild moment Harry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges \u2014 then he saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLike them, Potter?\u201d said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t all they do \u2014 look!\u201d\n\nHe pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed green:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed their badges too, until the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt the heat rise in his face and neck.\n\n\u201cOh very funny,\u201d Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, \u201creally witty.\u201d\n\nRon was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He wasn\u2019t laughing, but he wasn\u2019t sticking up for Harry either.\n\n\u201cWant one, Granger?\u201d said Malfoy, holding out a badge to Hermione. \u201cI\u2019ve got loads. But don\u2019t touch my hand, now. I\u2019ve just washed it, you see; don\u2019t want a Mudblood sliming it up.\u201d\n\nSome of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest. He had reached for his wand before he\u2019d thought what he was doing. People all around them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione said warningly.\n\n\u201cGo on, then, Potter,\u201d Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own wand. \u201cMoody\u2019s not here to look after you now \u2014 do it, if you\u2019ve got the guts \u2014\u201d\n\nFor a split second, they looked into each other\u2019s eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted.\n\n\u201cFurnunculus!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\n\u201cDensaugeo!\u201d screamed Malfoy.\n\nJets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles \u2014 Harry\u2019s hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy\u2019s hit Hermione. Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were springing up \u2014 Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d\n\nRon had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione\u2019s hand away from her face. It wasn\u2019t a pretty sight. Hermione\u2019s front teeth \u2014 already larger than average \u2014 were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin \u2014 panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry.\n\n\u201cAnd what is all this noise about?\u201d said a soft, deadly voice.\n\nSnape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, \u201cExplain.\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter attacked me, sir \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe attacked each other at the same time!\u201d Harry shouted.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and he hit Goyle \u2014 look \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.\n\n\u201cHospital wing, Goyle,\u201d Snape said calmly.\n\n\u201cMalfoy got Hermione!\u201d Ron said. \u201cLook!\u201d\n\nHe forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth \u2014 she was doing her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing at Hermione from behind Snape\u2019s back.\n\nSnape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, \u201cI see no difference.\u201d\n\nHermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.\n\nIt was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting at Snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist, however.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he said, in his silkiest voice. \u201cFifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get inside, or it\u2019ll be a week\u2019s worth of detentions.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces. He passed Snape, walked with Ron to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down onto the table. Ron was shaking with anger too \u2014 for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but then Ron turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus instead, leaving Harry alone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon, Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his badge, smirking. POTTER STINKS flashed once more across the room.\n\nHarry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing horrific things happening to him. . . . If only he knew how to do the Cruciatus Curse . . . he\u2019d have Snape flat on his back like that spider, jerking and twitching. . . .\n\n\u201cAntidotes!\u201d said Snape, looking around at them all, his cold black eyes glittering unpleasantly. \u201cYou should all have prepared your recipes now. I want you to brew them carefully, and then, we will be selecting someone on whom to test one. . . .\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s eyes met Harry\u2019s, and Harry knew what was coming. Snape was going to poison him. Harry imagined picking up his cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it down on Snape\u2019s greasy head \u2014\n\nAnd then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry\u2019s thoughts.\n\nIt was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at Harry, and walked up to Snape\u2019s desk at the front of the room.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Snape curtly.\n\n\u201cPlease, sir, I\u2019m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.\u201d\n\nSnape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded from his eager face.\n\n\u201cPotter has another hour of Potions to complete,\u201d said Snape coldly. \u201cHe will come upstairs when this class is finished.\u201d\n\nColin went pink.\n\n\u201cSir \u2014 sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,\u201d he said nervously. \u201cAll the champions have got to go, I think they want to take photographs. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry would have given anything he owned to have stopped Colin saying those last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron, but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cVery well, very well,\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cPotter, leave your things here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, sir \u2014 he\u2019s got to take his things with him,\u201d squeaked Colin. \u201cAll the champions \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well!\u201d said Snape. \u201cPotter \u2014 take your bag and get out of my sight!\u201d\n\nHarry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for the door. As he walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER STINKS flashed at him from every direction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t it, Harry?\u201d said Colin, starting to speak the moment Harry had closed the dungeon door behind him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it, though? You being champion?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, really amazing,\u201d said Harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall. \u201cWhat do they want photos for, Colin?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Daily Prophet, I think!\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Harry dully. \u201cExactly what I need. More publicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck!\u201d said Colin when they had reached the right room. Harry knocked on the door and entered.\n\nHe was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room, leaving a large space in the middle; three of them, however, had been placed end-to-end in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet. Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered desks, and Ludo Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes.\n\nViktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody. Cedric and Fleur were in conversation. Fleur looked a good deal happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the light. A paunchy man, holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye.\n\nBagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded forward.\n\n\u201cAh, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in you come . . . nothing to worry about, it\u2019s just the wand weighing ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWand weighing?\u201d Harry repeated nervously.\n\n\u201cWe have to check that your wands are fully functional, no problems, you know, as they\u2019re your most important tools in the tasks ahead,\u201d said Bagman. \u201cThe expert\u2019s upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there\u2019s going to be a little photo shoot. This is Rita Skeeter,\u201d he added, gesturing toward the witch in magenta robes. \u201cShe\u2019s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not that small, Ludo,\u201d said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on Harry.\n\nHer hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face. She wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended in two-inch nails, painted crimson.\n\n\u201cI wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start?\u201d she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. \u201cThe youngest champion, you know . . . to add a bit of color?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly!\u201d cried Bagman. \u201cThat is \u2014 if Harry has no objection?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cLovely,\u201d said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned fingers had Harry\u2019s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in there with all that noise,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s see . . . ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.\u201d\n\nIt was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her.\n\n\u201cCome along, dear \u2014 that\u2019s right \u2014 lovely,\u201d said Rita Skeeter again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket, pushing Harry down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door, throwing them into darkness. \u201cLet\u2019s see now . . .\u201d\n\nShe unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair, so that they could see what they were doing.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill? It leaves me free to talk to you normally. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d said Harry.\n\nRita Skeeter\u2019s smile widened. Harry counted three gold teeth. She reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acid-green quill and a roll of parchment, which she stretched out between them on a crate of Mrs. Skower\u2019s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her mouth, sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright on the parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering slightly.\n\n\u201cTesting . . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.\u201d\n\nHarry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment:\n\nAttractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLovely,\u201d said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her handbag. Now she leaned toward Harry and said, \u201cSo, Harry . . . what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014\u201d said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill. Even though he wasn\u2019t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence:\n\nAn ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIgnore the quill, Harry,\u201d said Rita Skeeter firmly. Reluctantly, Harry looked up at her instead. \u201cNow \u2014 why did you decide to enter the tournament, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire. I didn\u2019t put it in there.\u201d\n\nRita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow.\n\n\u201cCome now, Harry, there\u2019s no need to be scared of getting into trouble. We all know you shouldn\u2019t really have entered at all. But don\u2019t worry about that. Our readers love a rebel.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t enter,\u201d Harry repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t know who \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you feel about the tasks ahead?\u201d said Rita Skeeter. \u201cExcited? Nervous?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really thought . . . yeah, nervous, I suppose,\u201d said Harry. His insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke.\n\n\u201cChampions have died in the past, haven\u2019t they?\u201d said Rita Skeeter briskly. \u201cHave you thought about that at all?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . they say it\u2019s going to be a lot safer this year,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back and forward as though it were skating.\n\n\u201cOf course, you\u2019ve looked death in the face before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said Rita Skeeter, watching him closely. \u201cHow would you say that\u2019s affected you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry, yet again.\n\n\u201cDo you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t enter,\u201d said Harry, starting to feel irritated.\n\n\u201cCan you remember your parents at all?\u201d said Rita Skeeter, talking over him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHow do you think they\u2019d feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?\u201d\n\nHarry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to know how his parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel Rita Skeeter watching him very intently. Frowning, he avoided her gaze and looked down at words the quill had just written:\n\nTears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he can barely remember.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI have NOT got tears in my eyes!\u201d said Harry loudly.\n\nBefore Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open. Harry looked around, blinking in the bright light. Albus Dumbledore stood there, looking down at both of them, squashed into the cupboard.\n\n\u201cDumbledore!\u201d cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight \u2014 but Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover, and Rita\u2019s clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodile-skin bag. \u201cHow are you?\u201d she said, standing up and holding out one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore. \u201cI hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards\u2019 Conference?\u201d\n\n\u201cEnchantingly nasty,\u201d said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \u201cI particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.\u201d\n\nRita Skeeter didn\u2019t look remotely abashed.\n\n\u201cI was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned, Dumbledore, and that many wizards in the street \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness, Rita,\u201d said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later. The Weighing of the Wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.\u201d\n\nVery glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into the room. The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door, and he sat down quickly next to Cedric, looking up at the velvet-covered table, where four of the five judges were now sitting \u2014 Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr. Crouch, and Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once more on the parchment.\n\n\u201cMay I introduce Mr. Ollivander?\u201d said Dumbledore, taking his place at the judges\u2019 table and talking to the champions. \u201cHe will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.\u201d\n\nHarry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had met Mr. Ollivander before \u2014 he was the wandmaker from whom Harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon Alley.\n\n\u201cMademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room.\n\nFleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and handed him her wand.\n\n\u201cHmmm . . .\u201d he said.\n\nHe twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it close to his eyes and examined it carefully.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cnine and a half inches . . . inflexible . . . rosewood . . . and containing . . . dear me . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAn \u2019air from ze \u2019ead of a veela,\u201d said Fleur. \u201cOne of my grandmuzzer\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSo Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a mental note to tell Ron . . . then he remembered that Ron wasn\u2019t speaking to him.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, \u201cyes, I\u2019ve never used veela hair myself, of course. I find it makes for rather temperamental wands . . . however, to each his own, and if this suits you . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he muttered, \u201cOrchideous!\u201d and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand-tip.\n\n\u201cVery well, very well, it\u2019s in fine working order,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with her wand. \u201cMr. Diggory, you next.\u201d\n\nFleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.\n\n\u201cAh, now, this is one of mine, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, with much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. \u201cYes, I remember it well. Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn . . . must have been seventeen hands; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches . . . ash . . . pleasantly springy. It\u2019s in fine condition. . . . You treat it regularly?\u201d\n\n\u201cPolished it last night,\u201d said Cedric, grinning.\n\nHarry looked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously. Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted.\n\nMr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of Cedric\u2019s wand, pronounced himself satisfied, and then said, \u201cMr. Krum, if you please.\u201d\n\nViktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duck-footed, toward Mr. Ollivander. He thrust out his wand and stood scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, \u201cthis is a Gregorovitch creation, unless I\u2019m much mistaken? A fine wandmaker, though the styling is never quite what I . . . however . . .\u201d\n\nHe lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over and over before his eyes.\n\n\u201cYes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?\u201d he shot at Krum, who nodded. \u201cRather thicker than one usually sees . . . quite rigid . . . ten and a quarter inches . . . Avis!\u201d\n\nThe hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand. \u201cWhich leaves . . . Mr. Potter.\u201d\n\nHarry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander. He handed over his wand.\n\n\u201cAaaah, yes,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. \u201cYes, yes, yes. How well I remember.\u201d\n\nHarry could remember too. He could remember it as though it had happened yesterday. . . .\n\nFour summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr. Ollivander\u2019s shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try. Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him \u2014 this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. \u201cCurious,\u201d he had said, \u201ccurious,\u201d and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Ollivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry\u2019s wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort\u2019s.\n\nHarry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort\u2019s wand was something it couldn\u2019t help \u2014 rather as he couldn\u2019t help being related to Aunt Petunia. However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn\u2019t about to tell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter\u2019s Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if he did.\n\nMr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry\u2019s wand than anyone else\u2019s. Eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.\n\n\u201cThank you all,\u201d said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges\u2019 table. \u201cYou may go back to your lessons now \u2014 or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end \u2014\u201d\n\nFeeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cPhotos, Dumbledore, photos!\u201d cried Bagman excitedly. \u201cAll the judges and champions, what do you think, Rita?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes, let\u2019s do those first,\u201d said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes were upon Harry again. \u201cAnd then perhaps some individual shots.\u201d\n\nThe photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn\u2019t stand far enough back to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go.\n\nHarry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn\u2019t there \u2014 he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had an owl,\u201d said Ron brusquely the moment he walked in. He was pointing at Harry\u2019s pillow. The school barn owl was waiting for him there.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 right,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape\u2019s dungeon,\u201d said Ron.\n\nHe then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry. For a moment, Harry considered going after him \u2014 he wasn\u2019t sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing \u2014 but the lure of Sirius\u2019s answer was too strong. Harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it.\n\nHarry \u2014\n\nI can\u2019t say everything I would like to in a letter, it\u2019s too risky in case the owl is intercepted \u2014 we need to talk face-to-face. Can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in Gryffindor Tower at one o\u2019clock in the morning on the 22nd of November?\n\nI know better than anyone that you can look after yourself, and while you\u2019re around Dumbledore and Moody I don\u2019t think anyone will be able to hurt you. However, someone seems to be having a good try. Entering you in that tournament would have been very risky, especially right under Dumbledore\u2019s nose.\n\nBe on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about anything unusual. Let me know about the 22nd of November as quickly as you can."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter19": "THE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL\n\n\n\n\nThe prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all that sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker. The shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him like some horrific monster, barring his path. He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup. Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his whole life had been leading up to, and would finish with, the first task. . . .\n\nAdmittedly, he didn\u2019t see how Sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment. Harry wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time Sirius had suggested, and he and Hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn\u2019t have to resort to that \u2014 Filch would skin them alive.\n\nIn the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of Harry. Much of the front page had been given over to a picture of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and Cedric hadn\u2019t been mentioned at all.\n\nThe article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it. Rita Skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn\u2019t remember ever saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard.\n\nI suppose I get my strength from my parents. I know they\u2019d be very proud of me if they could see me now. . . . Yes, sometimes at night I still cry about them, I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it. . . . I know nothing will hurt me during the tournament, because they\u2019re watching over me. . . .\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his \u201cer\u2019s\u201d into long, sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people about him too.\n\nHarry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close friend, Colin Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen out of the company of one Hermione Granger, a stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like Harry, is one of the top students in the school.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to endure people \u2014 Slytherins, mainly \u2014 quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments.\n\n\u201cWant a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when have you been one of the top students in the school, Potter? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey \u2014 Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right!\u201d Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor, having had just about enough. \u201cI\u2019ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum, and I\u2019m just off to do a bit more. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 it was just \u2014 you dropped your quill.\u201d\n\nIt was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 right \u2014 sorry,\u201d he muttered, taking the quill back.\n\n\u201cEr . . . good luck on Tuesday,\u201d she said. \u201cI really hope you do well.\u201d\n\nWhich left Harry feeling extremely stupid.\n\nHermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she hadn\u2019t yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, Harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation.\n\n\u201cStunningly pretty? Her?\u201d Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come face-to-face with Hermione after Rita\u2019s article had appeared. \u201cWhat was she judging against \u2014 a chipmunk?\u201d\n\n\u201cIgnore it,\u201d Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though she couldn\u2019t hear them. \u201cJust ignore it, Harry.\u201d\n\nBut Harry couldn\u2019t ignore it. Ron hadn\u2019t spoken to him at all since he had told him about Snape\u2019s detentions. Harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats\u2019 brains in Snape\u2019s dungeon, but that had been the day Rita\u2019s article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed Ron\u2019s belief that Harry was really enjoying all the attention.\n\nHermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but Harry was adamant: He would talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted that Harry hadn\u2019t put his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for calling him a liar.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start this,\u201d Harry said stubbornly. \u201cIt\u2019s his problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou miss him!\u201d Hermione said impatiently. \u201cAnd I know he misses you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss him?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t miss him. . . . \u201d\n\nBut this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn\u2019t the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend. Harry still hadn\u2019t mastered Summoning Charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help. They consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes.\n\nViktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and Harry wondered what he was up to. Was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him through the first task? Hermione often complained about Krum being there \u2014 not that he ever bothered them \u2014 but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the noise distracting.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not even good-looking!\u201d she muttered angrily, glaring at Krum\u2019s sharp profile. \u201cThey only like him because he\u2019s famous! They wouldn\u2019t look twice at him if he couldn\u2019t do that Wonky-Faint thing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWronski Feint,\u201d said Harry, through gritted teeth. Quite apart from liking to get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another pang to imagine Ron\u2019s expression if he could have heard Hermione talking about Wonky-Faints.\n\nIt is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and would give anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit of speeding up. The days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed. Harry\u2019s feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he went, as ever-present as the snide comments about the Daily Prophet article.\n\nOn the Saturday before the first task, all students in the third year and above were permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade. Hermione told Harry that it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit, and Harry didn\u2019t need much persuasion.\n\n\u201cWhat about Ron, though?\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . well . . .\u201d Hermione went slightly pink. \u201cI thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly.\n\n\u201cOh Harry, this is so stupid \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come, but I\u2019m not meeting Ron, and I\u2019m wearing my Invisibility Cloak.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh all right then . . .\u201d Hermione snapped, \u201cbut I hate talking to you in that Cloak, I never know if I\u2019m looking at you or not.\u201d\n\nSo Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went back downstairs, and together he and Hermione set off for Hogsmeade.\n\nHarry felt wonderfully free under the Cloak; he watched other students walking past them as they entered the village, most of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that stupid article.\n\n\u201cPeople keep looking at me now,\u201d said Hermione grumpily as they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large cream-filled chocolates. \u201cThey think I\u2019m talking to myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move your lips so much then.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, please just take off your Cloak for a bit, no one\u2019s going to bother you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d said Harry. \u201cLook behind you.\u201d\n\nRita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the Three Broomsticks pub. Talking in low voices, they passed right by Hermione without looking at her. Harry backed into the wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him with her crocodile-skin handbag. When they were gone, Harry said, \u201cShe\u2019s staying in the village. I bet she\u2019s coming to watch the first task.\u201d\n\nAs he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic. He didn\u2019t mention this; he and Hermione hadn\u2019t discussed what was coming in the first task much; he had the feeling she didn\u2019t want to think about it.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it\u2019s a bit cold, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t have to talk to Ron!\u201d she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence.\n\nThe Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all-wizard village in Britain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves.\n\nIt was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward questions. Harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while Hermione went to buy drinks. On his way through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard poke in the back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it.\n\nHermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his Cloak.\n\n\u201cI look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own,\u201d she muttered. \u201cLucky I brought something to do.\u201d\n\nAnd she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his and Ron\u2019s names at the top of the very short list. It seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together, and Hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer.\n\n\u201cYou know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W.,\u201d Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around the pub.\n\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d said Harry. He took a swig of butterbeer under his Cloak. \u201cHermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuff?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen house-elves have decent wages and working conditions!\u201d she hissed back. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s time for more direct action. I wonder how you get into the school kitchens?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea, ask Fred and George,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his butterbeer, watching the people in the pub. All of them looked cheerful and relaxed. Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott were swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table, both of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges on their cloaks. Right over by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw friends. She wasn\u2019t wearing a Cedric badge though. . . . This cheered up Harry very slightly. . . .\n\nWhat wouldn\u2019t he have given to be one of these people, sitting around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but homework? He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadn\u2019t come out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn\u2019t be wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be sitting with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on Tuesday. He\u2019d have been really looking forward to it, watching them do whatever it was . . . cheering on Cedric with everyone else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands. . . .\n\nHe wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat in the library, poring over books.\n\nHarry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly. He would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire \u2014 assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately. . . .\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s Hagrid!\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThe back of Hagrid\u2019s enormous shaggy head \u2014 he had mercifully abandoned his bunches \u2014 emerged over the crowd. Harry wondered why he hadn\u2019t spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his hip flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn\u2019t seem to think much of this; she was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. Perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended cup.\n\nAs Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave. He waved, then remembered that Hagrid couldn\u2019t see him. Moody, however, paused, his magical eye on the corner where Harry was standing. He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being unable to reach his shoulder), muttered something to him, and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and Hermione\u2019s table.\n\n\u201cAll right, Hermione?\u201d said Hagrid loudly.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Hermione, smiling back.\n\nMoody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought he was reading the S.P.E.W. notebook, until he muttered, \u201cNice Cloak, Potter.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing from Moody\u2019s nose was particularly obvious at a few inches\u2019 distance. Moody grinned.\n\n\u201cCan your eye \u2014 I mean, can you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,\u201d Moody said quietly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s come in useful at times, I can tell you.\u201d\n\nHagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew Hagrid couldn\u2019t see him, but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was there. Hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only Harry could hear it, \u201cHarry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin. Wear that Cloak.\u201d\n\nStraightening up, Hagrid said loudly, \u201cNice ter see yeh, Hermione,\u201d winked, and departed. Moody followed him.\n\n\u201cWhy does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?\u201d Harry said, very surprised.\n\n\u201cDoes he?\u201d said Hermione, looking startled. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s up to? I don\u2019t know whether you should go, Harry. . . .\u201d She looked nervously around and hissed, \u201cIt might make you late for Sirius.\u201d\n\nIt was true that going down to Hagrid\u2019s at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to Hagrid\u2019s to tell him he couldn\u2019t go \u2014 always assuming she would consent to take the note, of course \u2014 Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know what this might be; Hagrid had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night.\n\nAt half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had pretended to go up to bed early, pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room. Quite a few people were still in there. The Creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggory! badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say Support Harry Potter! instead. So far, however, all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck on POTTER STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch. Then Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had planned. He slipped past her with a whispered \u201cThanks!\u201d and set off through the castle.\n\nThe grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in Hagrid\u2019s cabin. The inside of the enormous Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up; Harry could hear Madame Maxime talking inside it as he knocked on Hagrid\u2019s front door.\n\n\u201cYou there, Harry?\u201d Hagrid whispered, opening the door and looking around.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the Cloak down off his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot summat ter show yeh,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\nThere was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid. He was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease, but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair \u2014 Harry could see the comb\u2019s broken teeth tangled in it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you showing me?\u201d Harry said warily, wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant three-headed dog off a stranger in a pub.\n\n\u201cCome with me, keep quiet, an\u2019 keep yerself covered with that Cloak,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWe won\u2019 take Fang, he won\u2019 like it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, Hagrid, I can\u2019t stay long. . . . I\u2019ve got to be back up at the castle by one o\u2019clock \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Hagrid wasn\u2019t listening; he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night. Harry hurried to follow and found, to his great surprise, that Hagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons carriage.\n\n\u201cHagrid, what \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cShhh!\u201d said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands.\n\nMadame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders. She smiled when she saw Hagrid.\n\n\u201cAh, \u2019Agrid . . . it is time?\u201d\n\n\u201cBong-sewer,\u201d said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps.\n\nMadame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime\u2019s giant winged horses, with Harry, totally bewildered, running to keep up with them. Had Hagrid wanted to show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old time he wanted . . . she wasn\u2019t exactly hard to miss. . . .\n\nBut it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as Harry, because after a while she said playfully, \u201cWair is it you are taking me, \u2019Agrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh\u2019ll enjoy this,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly, \u201cworth seein\u2019, trust me. On\u2019y \u2014 don\u2019 go tellin\u2019 anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh\u2019re not s\u2019posed ter know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long black eyelashes.\n\nAnd still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along in their wake, checking his watch every now and then. Hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might make him miss Sirius. If they didn\u2019t get there soon, he was going to turn around, go straight back to the castle, and leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime. . . .\n\nBut then \u2014 when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight \u2014 Harry heard something. Men were shouting up ahead . . . then came a deafening, earsplitting roar. . . .\n\nHagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them \u2014 for a split second, he thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them \u2014 and then his mouth fell open.\n\nDragons.\n\nFour fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood, roaring and snorting \u2014 torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks. There was a silvery-blue one with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and stamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air; and a gigantic black one, more lizard-like than the others, which was nearest to them.\n\nAt least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs. Mesmerized, Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat\u2019s, bulging with either fear or rage, he couldn\u2019t tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise, a yowling, screeching scream. . . .\n\n\u201cKeep back there, Hagrid!\u201d yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding. \u201cThey can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet, you know! I\u2019ve seen this Horntail do forty!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs\u2019n\u2019 it beautiful?\u201d said Hagrid softly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good!\u201d yelled another wizard. \u201cStunning Spells, on the count of three!\u201d\n\nHarry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.\n\n\u201cStupefy!\u201d they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on the dragons\u2019 scaly hides \u2014\n\nHarry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame, though still smoking \u2014 then, very slowly, it fell. Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quake.\n\nThe dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs, which they forced deep into the ground with their wands.\n\n\u201cWan\u2019 a closer look?\u201d Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly. The pair of them moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed. The wizard who had warned Hagrid not to come any closer turned, and Harry realized who it was: Charlie Weasley.\n\n\u201cAll right, Hagrid?\u201d he panted, coming over to talk. \u201cThey should be okay now \u2014 we put them out with a Sleeping Draught on the way here, thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet \u2014 but, like you saw, they weren\u2019t happy, not happy at all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat breeds you got here, Charlie?\u201d said Hagrid, gazing at the closest dragon, the black one, with something close to reverence. Its eyes were still just open. Harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid.\n\n\u201cThis is a Hungarian Horntail,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cThere\u2019s a Common Welsh Green over there, the smaller one \u2014 a Swedish Short-Snout, that blue-gray \u2014 and a Chinese Fireball, that\u2019s the red.\u201d\n\nCharlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling away around the edge of the enclosure, gazing at the Stunned dragons.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,\u201d Charlie said, frowning. \u201cThe champions aren\u2019t supposed to know what\u2019s coming \u2014 she\u2019s bound to tell her student, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 thought she\u2019d like ter see \u2019em,\u201d shrugged Hagrid, still gazing, enraptured, at the dragons.\n\n\u201cReally romantic date, Hagrid,\u201d said Charlie, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cFour . . .\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cso it\u2019s one fer each o\u2019 the champions, is it? What\u2019ve they gotta do \u2014 fight \u2019em?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust get past them, I think,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on hand if it gets nasty, Extinguishing Spells at the ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don\u2019t know why . . . but I tell you this, I don\u2019t envy the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious thing. Its back end\u2019s as dangerous as its front, look.\u201d\n\nCharlie pointed toward the Horntail\u2019s tail, and Harry saw long, bronze-colored spikes protruding along it every few inches.\n\nFive of Charlie\u2019s fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at that moment, carrying a clutch of huge granite-gray eggs between them in a blanket. They placed them carefully at the Horntail\u2019s side. Hagrid let out a moan of longing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got them counted, Hagrid,\u201d said Charlie sternly. Then he said, \u201cHow\u2019s Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.\n\n\u201cJust hope he\u2019s still fine after he\u2019s faced this lot,\u201d said Charlie grimly, looking out over the dragons\u2019 enclosure. \u201cI didn\u2019t dare tell Mum what he\u2019s got to do for the first task; she\u2019s already having kittens about him. . . .\u201d Charlie imitated his mother\u2019s anxious voice. \u201c\u2018How could they let him enter that tournament, he\u2019s much too young! I thought they were all safe, I thought there was going to be an age limit!\u2019 She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him. \u2018He still cries about his parents! Oh bless him, I never knew!\u2019\u201d\n\nHarry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn\u2019t miss him, with the attractions of four dragons and Madame Maxime to occupy him, he turned silently and began to walk away, back to the castle.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know whether he was glad he\u2019d seen what was coming or not. Perhaps this way was better. The first shock was over now. Maybe if he\u2019d seen the dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he would have passed out cold in front of the whole school . . . but maybe he would anyway. . . . He was going to be armed with his wand \u2014 which, just now, felt like nothing more than a narrow strip of wood \u2014 against a fifty-foot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, fire-breathing dragon. And he had to get past it. With everyone watching. How?\n\nHarry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he couldn\u2019t remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now \u2014 when, without warning, he ran into something very solid.\n\nHarry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the Cloak around him. A voice nearby said, \u201cOuch! Who\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nHarry hastily checked that the Cloak was covering him and lay very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He recognized the goatee . . . it was Karkaroff.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking around in the darkness. Harry remained still and silent. After a minute or so, Karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were.\n\nVery slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying through the darkness back toward Hogwarts.\n\nHe had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be. He might even have spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime heading off around the forest together \u2014 they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance . . . and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would know what was in store for the champions.\n\nBy the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the unknown on Tuesday was Cedric.\n\nHarry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he didn\u2019t dare slow down. . . . He had less than five minutes to get up to the fire. . . .\n\n\u201cBalderdash!\u201d he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole.\n\n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, and the picture swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was deserted, and, judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not needed to set off any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.\n\nHarry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the flames were the only source of light. Nearby, on a table, the Support Cedric Diggory! badges the Creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight. They now read POTTER REALLY STINKS. Harry looked back into the flames, and jumped.\n\nSirius\u2019s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn\u2019t seen Mr. Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys\u2019 kitchen, it would have scared him out of his wits. Instead, his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched down by the hearth, and said, \u201cSirius \u2014 how\u2019re you doing?\u201d\n\nSirius looked different from Harry\u2019s memory of him. When they had said good-bye, Sirius\u2019s face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hair \u2014 but the hair was short and clean now, Sirius\u2019s face was fuller, and he looked younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had of him, which had been taken at the Potters\u2019 wedding.\n\n\u201cNever mind me, how are you?\u201d said Sirius seriously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2014\u201d For a second, Harry tried to say \u201cfine\u201d \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t do it. Before he could stop himself, he was talking more than he\u2019d talked in days \u2014 about how no one believed he hadn\u2019t entered the tournament of his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about him in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn\u2019t walk down a corridor without being sneered at \u2014 and about Ron, Ron not believing him, Ron\u2019s jealousy . . .\n\n\u201c. . . and now Hagrid\u2019s just shown me what\u2019s coming in the first task, and it\u2019s dragons, Sirius, and I\u2019m a goner,\u201d he finished desperately.\n\nSirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that had not yet lost the look that Azkaban had given them \u2014 that deadened, haunted look. He had let Harry talk himself into silence without interruption, but now he said, \u201cDragons we can deal with, Harry, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute \u2014 I haven\u2019t got long here . . . I\u2019ve broken into a Wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be back at any time. There are things I need to warn you about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches. . . . Surely there could be nothing worse than dragons coming?\n\n\u201cKarkaroff,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cHarry, he was a Death Eater. You know what Death Eaters are, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 he \u2014 what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released. I\u2019d bet everything that\u2019s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year \u2014 to keep an eye on him. Moody caught Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cKarkaroff got released?\u201d Harry said slowly \u2014 his brain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information. \u201cWhy did they release him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,\u201d said Sirius bitterly. \u201cHe said he\u2019d seen the error of his ways, and then he named names . . . he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place. . . . He\u2019s not very popular in there, I can tell you. And since he got out, from what I can tell, he\u2019s been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his. So watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cBut . . . are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the goblet? Because if he did, he\u2019s a really good actor. He seemed furious about it. He wanted to stop me from competing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s a good actor,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cbecause he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn\u2019t he? Now, I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet, Harry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 you and the rest of the world,\u201d said Harry bitterly.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman\u2019s article last month, Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm,\u201d Sirius said hastily, seeing Harry about to speak, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around. And no one\u2019s going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye\u2019s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo . . . what are you saying?\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cKarkaroff\u2019s trying to kill me? But \u2014 why?\u201d\n\nSirius hesitated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing some very strange things,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThe Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn\u2019t they? Someone set off the Dark Mark . . . and then \u2014 did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who\u2019s gone missing?\u201d\n\n\u201cBertha Jorkins?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cExactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that\u2019s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but . . . it\u2019s not very likely she\u2019d have walked straight into Voldemort, is it?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cListen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,\u201d said Sirius grimly. \u201cShe was at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me. And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It\u2019s not a good combination, Harry. I\u2019d say she\u2019d be very easy to lure into a trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?\u201d said Harry. \u201cIs that what you mean? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Sirius slowly, \u201cI just don\u2019t know . . . Karkaroff doesn\u2019t strike me as the type who\u2019d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him. But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason, and I can\u2019t help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like a really good plan from where I\u2019m standing,\u201d said Harry, grinning bleakly. \u201cThey\u2019ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight \u2014 these dragons,\u201d said Sirius, speaking very quickly now. \u201cThere\u2019s a way, Harry. Don\u2019t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell \u2014 dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know, I just saw,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBut you can do it alone,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cThere is a way, and a simple spell\u2019s all you need. Just \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him.\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d he hissed at Sirius. \u201cGo! There\u2019s someone coming!\u201d\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire \u2014 if someone saw Sirius\u2019s face within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an almighty uproar \u2014 the Ministry would get dragged in \u2014 he, Harry, would be questioned about Sirius\u2019s whereabouts \u2014\n\nHarry heard a tiny pop! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius had gone. He watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had decided to go for a stroll at one o\u2019clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon?\n\nIt was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped dead facing Harry across the room, and looked around.\n\n\u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with you?\u201d Harry snarled. \u201cWhat are you doing down here at this time of night?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wondered where you \u2014\u201d Ron broke off, shrugging. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m going back to bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust thought you\u2019d come nosing around, did you?\u201d Harry shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he\u2019d walked in on, knew he hadn\u2019t done it on purpose, but he didn\u2019t care \u2014 at this moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.\n\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d said Ron, his face reddening with anger. \u201cShould\u2019ve realized you didn\u2019t want to be disturbed. I\u2019ll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace.\u201d\n\nHarry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit Ron on the forehead and bounced off.\n\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d Harry said. \u201cSomething for you to wear on Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if you\u2019re lucky. . . . That\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHe strode across the room toward the stairs; he half expected Ron to stop him, he would even have liked Ron to throw a punch at him, but Ron just stood there in his too-small pajamas, and Harry, having stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming for a long time afterward and didn\u2019t hear him come up to bed."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter20": "THE FIRST TASK\n\n\n\n\nHarry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock. When he\u2019d finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds. There, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.\n\nAlarmed as she was by Sirius\u2019s warnings about Karkaroff, Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problem.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening,\u201d she said desperately, \u201cand then we can worry about Karkaroff.\u201d\n\nThey walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead. Here, Harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.\n\n\u201c\u2018Talon-clipping by charms . . . treating scale-rot . . .\u2019 This is no good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate . . .\u2019 But Sirius said a simple one would do it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try some simple spellbooks, then,\u201d said Harry, throwing aside Men Who Love Dragons Too Much.\n\nHe returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them down, and began to flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.\n\n\u201cWell, there are Switching Spells . . . but what\u2019s the point of Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less dangerous. . . . The trouble is, like that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon\u2019s hide. . . . I\u2019d say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really haven\u2019t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall . . . unless you\u2019re supposed to put the spell on yourself? Maybe to give yourself extra powers? But they\u2019re not simple spells, I mean, we haven\u2019t done any of those in class, I only know about them because I\u2019ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d Harry said, through gritted teeth, \u201cwill you shut up for a bit, please? I\u2019m trying to concentrate.\u201d\n\nBut all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that Harry\u2019s brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn\u2019t seem to allow room for concentration. He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping . . . but dragons had no hair . . . pepper breath . . . that would probably increase a dragon\u2019s firepower . . . horn tongue . . . just what he needed, to give it an extra weapon . . .\n\n\u201cOh no, he\u2019s back again, why can\u2019t he read on his stupid ship?\u201d said Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly look over at the pair of them, and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books. \u201cCome on, Harry, we\u2019ll go back to the common room . . . his fan club\u2019ll be here in a moment, twittering away. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed past them, one of them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her waist.\n\nHarry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from Hogwarts. But as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn\u2019t do it. It was the only place he had ever been happy . . . well, he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn\u2019t remember that.\n\nSomehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn\u2019t working too well), and as he and Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff table.\n\nCedric still didn\u2019t know about the dragons . . . the only champion who didn\u2019t, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and Karkaroff would have told Fleur and Krum. . . .\n\n\u201cHermione, I\u2019ll see you in the greenhouses,\u201d Harry said, coming to his decision as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. \u201cGo on, I\u2019ll catch you up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019ll be late, the bell\u2019s about to ring \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll catch you up, okay?\u201d\n\nBy the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric was at the top. He was with a load of sixth-year friends. Harry didn\u2019t want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter\u2019s article at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.\n\n\u201cDiffindo!\u201d\n\nCedric\u2019s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it onto the floor. Several bottles of ink smashed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him. \u201cTell Flitwick I\u2019m coming, go on. . . .\u201d\n\nThis was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric\u2019s friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink. \u201cMy bag just split . . . brand-new and all . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCedric,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthe first task is dragons.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Cedric, looking up.\n\n\u201cDragons,\u201d said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to. \u201cThey\u2019ve got four, one for each of us, and we\u2019ve got to get past them.\u201d\n\nCedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he\u2019d been feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric\u2019s gray eyes.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Cedric said in a hushed voice.\n\n\u201cDead sure,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how did you find out? We\u2019re not supposed to know. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Harry quickly \u2014 he knew Hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth. \u201cBut I\u2019m not the only one who knows. Fleur and Krum will know by now \u2014 Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too.\u201d\n\nCedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment, and books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at Harry, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhy are you telling me?\u201d he asked.\n\nHarry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn\u2019t have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn\u2019t have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared \u2014 well, perhaps Malfoy or Snape . . .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . fair, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said to Cedric. \u201cWe all know now . . . we\u2019re on an even footing, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nCedric was still looking at him in a slightly suspicious way when Harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned around and saw Mad-Eye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom.\n\n\u201cCome with me, Potter,\u201d he growled. \u201cDiggory, off you go.\u201d\n\nHarry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them?\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 Professor, I\u2019m supposed to be in Herbology \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind that, Potter. In my office, please. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to him now. What if Moody wanted to know how he\u2019d found out about the dragons? Would Moody go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he\u2019d be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet . . .\n\nHe followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal one.\n\n\u201cThat was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,\u201d Moody said quietly.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say; this wasn\u2019t the reaction he had expected at all.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around.\n\nHe had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In Professor Lockhart\u2019s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when he had been an Auror.\n\nOn his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though it was much smaller than Moody\u2019s. In the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus.\n\n\u201cLike my Dark Detectors, do you?\u201d said Moody, who was watching Harry closely.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden aerial.\n\n\u201cSecrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies . . . no use here, of course, too much interference \u2014 students in every direction lying about why they haven\u2019t done their homework. Been humming ever since I got here. I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it wouldn\u2019t stop whistling. It\u2019s extra-sensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,\u201d he added in a growl.\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the mirror for?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh that\u2019s my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around? I\u2019m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That\u2019s when I open my trunk.\u201d\n\nHe let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk under the window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered what was in there, until Moody\u2019s next question brought him sharply back to earth.\n\n\u201cSo . . . found out about the dragons, have you?\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated. He\u2019d been afraid of this \u2014 but he hadn\u2019t told Cedric, and he certainly wasn\u2019t going to tell Moody, that Hagrid had broken the rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan. \u201cCheating\u2019s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t cheat,\u201d said Harry sharply. \u201cIt was \u2014 a sort of accident that I found out.\u201d\n\nMoody grinned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t accusing you, laddie. I\u2019ve been telling Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes, but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won\u2019t be. They\u2019ll have told their champions everything they can. They want to win. They want to beat Dumbledore. They\u2019d like to prove he\u2019s only human.\u201d\n\nMoody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it.\n\n\u201cSo . . . got any ideas how you\u2019re going to get past your dragon yet?\u201d said Moody.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to tell you,\u201d said Moody gruffly. \u201cI don\u2019t show favoritism, me. I\u2019m just going to give you some good, general advice. And the first bit is \u2014 play to your strengths.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any,\u201d said Harry, before he could stop himself.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d growled Moody, \u201cyou\u2019ve got strengths if I say you\u2019ve got them. Think now. What are you best at?\u201d\n\nHarry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was easy, really \u2014\n\n\u201cQuidditch,\u201d he said dully, \u201cand a fat lot of help \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical eye barely moving at all. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn good flier from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but . . .\u201d Harry stared at him. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed a broom, I\u2019ve only got my wand \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy second piece of general advice,\u201d said Moody loudly, interrupting him, \u201cis to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to get what you need.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at him blankly. What did he need?\n\n\u201cCome on, boy . . .\u201d whispered Moody. \u201cPut them together . . . it\u2019s not that difficult. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the dragon in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Firebolt, he needed \u2014\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d Harry whispered, when he had sped into the greenhouse three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout as he passed her. \u201cHermione \u2014 I need you to help me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think I\u2019ve been trying to do, Harry?\u201d she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.\n\n\u201cHermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.\u201d\n\nAnd so they practiced. They didn\u2019t have lunch, but headed for a free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him. He was still having problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping like stones to the floor.\n\n\u201cConcentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . . \u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think I\u2019m trying to do?\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cA great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . . Okay, try again. . . .\u201d\n\nHe wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no point in staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good,\u201d said Harry loudly, his temper getting the better of him, \u201cjust as long as it\u2019s not drawn-out. I don\u2019t want to suffer.\u201d\n\nRon looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he certainly caught Harry\u2019s eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand, though he wasn\u2019t entirely sure that was his prowess at Summoning Charms \u2014 perhaps the fly was just stupid.\n\nHe forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers. They kept practicing until past midnight. They would have stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at him, started chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty.\n\nAt two o\u2019clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville\u2019s toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better, Harry, that\u2019s loads better,\u201d Hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased.\n\n\u201cWell, now we know what to do next time I can\u2019t manage a spell,\u201d Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, \u201cthreaten me with a dragon. Right . . .\u201d He raised his wand once more. \u201cAccio Dictionary!\u201d\n\nThe heavy book soared out of Hermione\u2019s hand, flew across the room, and Harry caught it.\n\n\u201cHarry, I really think you\u2019ve got it!\u201d said Hermione delightedly.\n\n\u201cJust as long as it works tomorrow,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThe Firebolt\u2019s going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it\u2019s going to be in the castle, and I\u2019m going to be out there on the grounds. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Hermione firmly. \u201cJust as long as you\u2019re concentrating really, really hard on it, it\u2019ll come. Harry, we\u2019d better get some sleep . . . you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d\n\nHarry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had left him. It returned in full measure, however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement. Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get down to the dragons\u2019 enclosure \u2014 though of course, they didn\u2019t yet know what they would find there.\n\nHarry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing \u201cWe\u2019ll have a box of tissues ready, Potter\u201d as he passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn\u2019t just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to curse everyone in sight. Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and the next, walking into lunch . . . and then (where had the morning gone? the last of the dragon-free hours?), Professor McGonagall was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people were watching.\n\n\u201cPotter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds now. . . . You have to get ready for your first task.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate with a clatter.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own.\n\nHe left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn\u2019t seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t panic,\u201d she said, \u201cjust keep a cool head. . . . We\u2019ve got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand. . . . The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will think any the worse of you. . . . Are you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry heard himself say. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nShe was leading him toward the place where the dragons were, around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re to go in here with the other champions,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, \u201cand wait for your turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there . . . he\u2019ll be telling you the \u2014 the procedure. . . . Good luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.\n\nFleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool. She didn\u2019t look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and clammy. Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry supposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was pacing up and down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small smile, which Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard, as though they had forgotten how to do it.\n\n\u201cHarry! Good-o!\u201d said Bagman happily, looking around at him. \u201cCome in, come in, make yourself at home!\u201d\n\nBagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing his old Wasp robes again.\n\n\u201cWell, now we\u2019re all here \u2014 time to fill you in!\u201d said Bagman brightly. \u201cWhen the audience has assembled, I\u2019m going to be offering each of you this bag\u201d \u2014 he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them \u2014 \u201cfrom which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face! There are different \u2014 er \u2014 varieties, you see. And I have to tell you something else too . . . ah, yes . . . your task is to collect the golden egg!\u201d\n\nHarry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he understood Bagman\u2019s words, and then started pacing around the tent again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum hadn\u2019t reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But they, at least, had volunteered for this. . . .\n\nAnd in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly, laughing, joking. . . . Harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species. And then \u2014 it seemed like about a second later to Harry \u2014 Bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sack.\n\n\u201cLadies first,\u201d he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.\n\nShe put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon \u2014 a Welsh Green. It had the number two around its neck. And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming.\n\nThe same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese Fireball. It had a number three around its neck. He didn\u2019t even blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground.\n\nCedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray Swedish Short-Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four. It stretched its wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs.\n\n\u201cWell, there you are!\u201d said Bagman. \u201cYou have each pulled out the dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I\u2019m going to have to leave you in a moment, because I\u2019m commentating. Mr. Diggory, you\u2019re first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle, all right? Now . . . Harry . . . could I have a quick word? Outside?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . yes,\u201d said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of the tent with Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his face.\n\n\u201cFeeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI \u2014 no, nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot a plan?\u201d said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t mind sharing a few pointers, if you\u2019d like them, you know. I mean,\u201d Bagman continued, lowering his voice still further, \u201cyou\u2019re the underdog here, Harry. . . . Anything I can do to help . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude, \u201cno \u2014 I \u2014 I know what I\u2019m going to do, thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody would know, Harry,\u201d said Bagman, winking at him.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine. \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan worked out, I \u2014\u201d\n\nA whistle had blown somewhere.\n\n\u201cGood lord, I\u2019ve got to run!\u201d said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off.\n\nHarry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it, greener than ever. Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past, but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.\n\nHarry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds later, they heard the roar of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the enclosure and was now face-to-face with the living counterpart of his model. . . .\n\nIt was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there and listening. The crowd screamed . . . yelled . . . gasped like a single many-headed entity, as Cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the Swedish Short-Snout. Krum was still staring at the ground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric\u2019s steps, around and around the tent. And Bagman\u2019s commentary made everything much, much worse. . . . Horrible pictures formed in Harry\u2019s mind as he heard: \u201cOooh, narrow miss there, very narrow\u201d . . . \u201cHe\u2019s taking risks, this one!\u201d . . . \u201cClever move \u2014 pity it didn\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nAnd then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden egg.\n\n\u201cVery good indeed!\u201d Bagman was shouting. \u201cAnd now the marks from the judges!\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowd.\n\n\u201cOne down, three to go!\u201d Bagman yelled as the whistle blew again. \u201cMiss Delacour, if you please!\u201d\n\nFleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she left the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand. He and Krum were left alone, at opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other\u2019s gaze.\n\nThe same process started again. . . . \u201cOh I\u2019m not sure that was wise!\u201d they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully. \u201cOh . . . nearly! Careful now . . . good lord, I thought she\u2019d had it then!\u201d\n\nTen minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more. . . . Fleur must have been successful too. A pause, while Fleur\u2019s marks were being shown . . . more clapping . . . then, for the third time, the whistle.\n\n\u201cAnd here comes Mr. Krum!\u201d cried Bagman, and Krum slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone.\n\nHe felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with fear . . . yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far away. . . .\n\n\u201cVery daring!\u201d Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew its collective breath. \u201cThat\u2019s some nerve he\u2019s showing \u2014 and \u2014 yes, he\u2019s got the egg!\u201d\n\nApplause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had finished \u2014 it would be Harry\u2019s turn any moment.\n\nHe stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. And now he was walking past the trees, through a gap in the enclosure fence.\n\nHe saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream. There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he\u2019d last stood on this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly, black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge marks in the hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of noise, but whether friendly or not, Harry didn\u2019t know or care. It was time to do what he had to do . . . to focus his mind, entirely and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance. . . .\n\nHe raised his wand.\n\n\u201cAccio Firebolt!\u201d he shouted.\n\nHarry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn\u2019t worked . . . if it wasn\u2019t coming . . . He seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely. . . .\n\nAnd then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in midair beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise. . . . Bagman was shouting something . . . but Harry\u2019s ears were not working properly anymore . . . listening wasn\u2019t important. . . .\n\nHe swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground. And a second later, something miraculous happened. . . .\n\nAs he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the crowd\u2019s faces became mere flesh-colored pinpricks below, and the Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had left not only the ground behind, but also his fear. . . . He was back where he belonged. . . .\n\nThis was just another Quidditch match, that was all . . . just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly opposing team. . . .\n\nHe looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one, gleaming against its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon\u2019s front legs. \u201cOkay,\u201d Harry told himself, \u201cdiversionary tactics . . . let\u2019s go. . . .\u201d\n\nHe dived. The Horntail\u2019s head followed him; he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away . . . but Harry didn\u2019t care . . . that was no more than dodging a Bludger. . . .\n\n\u201cGreat Scott, he can fly!\u201d yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped. \u201cAre you watching this, Mr. Krum?\u201d\n\nHarry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following his progress; its head revolving on its long neck \u2014 if he kept this up, it would be nicely dizzy \u2014 but better not push it too long, or it would be breathing fire again \u2014\n\nHarry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but this time he was less lucky \u2014 he missed the flames, but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead, and as he swerved to the left, one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes \u2014\n\nHe could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd, but the cut didn\u2019t seem to be deep. . . . Now he zoomed around the back of the Horntail, and a possibility occurred to him. . . .\n\nThe Horntail didn\u2019t seem to want to take off, she was too protective of her eggs. Though she writhed and twisted, furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on Harry, she was afraid to move too far from them . . . but he had to persuade her to do it, or he\u2019d never get near them. . . . The trick was to do it carefully, gradually. . . .\n\nHe began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him. Her head swayed this way and that, watching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs bared. . . .\n\nHe flew higher. The Horntail\u2019s head rose with him, her neck now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, like a snake before its charmer. . . .\n\nHarry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation. He was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail thrashed again, but he was too high to reach now. . . . She shot fire into the air, which he dodged. . . . Her jaws opened wide. . . .\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her, \u201ccome on, come and get me . . . up you get now . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings at last, as wide as those of a small airplane \u2014 and Harry dived. Before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs \u2014 he had taken his hands off his Firebolt \u2014 he had seized the golden egg \u2014\n\nAnd with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out over the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up \u2014 for the first time, he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the Irish supporters at the World Cup \u2014\n\n\u201cLook at that!\u201d Bagman was yelling. \u201cWill you look at that! Our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr. Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him toward them, their smiles evident even from this distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his heart lighter than it had been in weeks. . . . He had got through the first task, he had survived. . . .\n\n\u201cThat was excellent, Potter!\u201d cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the Firebolt \u2014 which from her was extravagant praise. He noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score. . . . Over there, she\u2019s had to mop up Diggory already. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh did it, Harry!\u201d said Hagrid hoarsely. \u201cYeh did it! An\u2019 agains\u2019 the Horntail an\u2019 all, an\u2019 yeh know Charlie said that was the wors\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, Hagrid,\u201d said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn\u2019t blunder on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons beforehand.\n\nProfessor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was dancing in its socket.\n\n\u201cNice and easy does the trick, Potter,\u201d he growled.\n\n\u201cRight then, Potter, the first aid tent, please . . .\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\nHarry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking worried.\n\n\u201cDragons!\u201d she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric\u2019s shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn\u2019t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry\u2019s shoulder, talking furiously all the while. \u201cLast year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You\u2019re very lucky . . . this is quite shallow . . . it\u2019ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though. . . .\u201d\n\nShe cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand, and he felt it heal instantly.\n\n\u201cNow, just sit quietly for a minute \u2014 sit! And then you can go and get your score.\u201d\n\nShe bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say, \u201cHow does it feel now, Diggory?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he\u2019d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside \u2014 Hermione, followed closely by Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry, you were brilliant!\u201d Hermione said squeakily. There were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear. \u201cYou were amazing! You really were!\u201d\n\nBut Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring at Harry as though he were a ghost.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he said, very seriously, \u201cwhoever put your name in that goblet \u2014 I \u2014 I reckon they\u2019re trying to do you in!\u201d\n\nIt was as though the last few weeks had never happened \u2014 as though Harry were meeting Ron for the first time, right after he\u2019d been made champion.\n\n\u201cCaught on, have you?\u201d said Harry coldly. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d\n\nHermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to the other. Ron opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn\u2019t need to hear it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, before Ron could get the words out. \u201cForget it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cForget it,\u201d Harry said.\n\nRon grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back.\n\nHermione burst into tears.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to cry about!\u201d Harry told her, bewildered.\n\n\u201cYou two are so stupid!\u201d she shouted, stamping her foot on the ground, tears splashing down her front. Then, before either of them could stop her, she had given both of them a hug and dashed away, now positively howling.\n\n\u201cBarking mad,\u201d said Ron, shaking his head. \u201cHarry, c\u2019mon, they\u2019ll be putting up your scores. . . .\u201d\n\nPicking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked out of the tent, Ron by his side, talking fast.\n\n\u201cYou were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground . . . turned it into a dog . . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well \u2014 the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away. And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance \u2014 well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire \u2014 she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand. And Krum \u2014 you won\u2019t believe this, but he didn\u2019t even think of flying! He was probably the best after you, though. Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs \u2014 they took marks off for that, he wasn\u2019t supposed to do any damage to them.\u201d\n\nRon drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure. Now that the Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see where the five judges were sitting \u2014 right at the other end, in raised seats draped in gold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s marks out of ten from each one,\u201d Ron said, and Harry, squinting up the field, saw the first judge \u2014 Madame Maxime \u2014 raise her wand in the air. What looked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which twisted itself into a large figure eight.\n\n\u201cNot bad!\u201d said Ron as the crowd applauded. \u201cI suppose she took marks off for your shoulder. . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into the air.\n\n\u201cLooking good!\u201d Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.\n\nNext, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd was cheering harder than ever.\n\nLudo Bagman \u2014 ten.\n\n\u201cTen?\u201d said Harry in disbelief. \u201cBut . . . I got hurt. . . . What\u2019s he playing at?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, don\u2019t complain!\u201d Ron yelled excitedly.\n\nAnd now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a moment, and then a number shot out of his wand too \u2014 four.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ron bellowed furiously. \u201cFour? You lousy, biased scumbag, you gave Krum ten!\u201d\n\nBut Harry didn\u2019t care, he wouldn\u2019t have cared if Karkaroff had given him zero; Ron\u2019s indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him. He didn\u2019t tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure. And it wasn\u2019t just Ron . . . those weren\u2019t only Gryffindors cheering in the crowd. When it had come to it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of the school had been on his side as well as Cedric\u2019s. . . . He didn\u2019t care about the Slytherins, he could stand whatever they threw at him now.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!\u201d said Charlie Weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to run, I\u2019ve got to go and send Mum an owl, I swore I\u2019d tell her what happened \u2014 but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah \u2014 and they told me to tell you you\u2019ve got to hang around for a few more minutes. . . . Bagman wants a word, back in the champions\u2019 tent.\u201d\n\nRon said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which somehow looked quite different now: friendly and welcoming. He thought back to how he\u2019d felt while dodging the Horntail, and compared it to the long wait before he\u2019d walked out to face it. . . . There was no comparison; the wait had been immeasurably worse.\n\nFleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One side of Cedric\u2019s face was covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn. He grinned at Harry when he saw him.\n\n\u201cGood one, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d said Harry, grinning back.\n\n\u201cWell done, all of you!\u201d said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon. \u201cNow, just a quick few words. You\u2019ve got a nice long break before the second task, which will take place at half past nine on the morning of February the twenty-fourth \u2014 but we\u2019re giving you something to think about in the meantime! If you look down at those golden eggs you\u2019re all holding, you will see that they open . . . see the hinges there? You need to solve the clue inside the egg \u2014 because it will tell you what the second task is, and enable you to prepare for it! All clear? Sure? Well, off you go, then!\u201d\n\nHarry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail. Then, as they rounded the clump of trees behind which Harry had first heard the dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.\n\nIt was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes today; the Quick-Quotes Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Harry!\u201d she said, beaming at him. \u201cI wonder if you could give me a quick word? How you felt facing that dragon? How you feel now, about the fairness of the scoring?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can have a word,\u201d said Harry savagely. \u201cGood-bye.\u201d\n\nAnd he set off back to the castle with Ron."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter21": "THE HOUSE-ELF LIBERATION FRONT\n\n\n\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all along.\n\n\u201cFits, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cRemember what Malfoy said on the train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know where they knew each other. They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup. . . . I\u2019ll tell you one thing, though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he\u2019s going to be feeling really stupid now, isn\u2019t he? Didn\u2019t work, did it? You only got a scratch! Come here \u2014 I\u2019ll do it \u2014\u201d\n\nPigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around and around Harry\u2019s head, hooting incessantly. Ron snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry attached the letter to his leg.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?\u201d Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon to the window. \u201cYou know what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\nHarry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same. Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her arms, and frowned at Ron.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cIf that was the first task, I hate to think what\u2019s coming next.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight little ray of sunshine, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.\u201d\n\nHe threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again; the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual \u2014 Harry hadn\u2019t been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-by-blow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, \u201cWell, we\u2019d better get downstairs for your surprise party, Harry \u2014 Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now.\u201d\n\nSure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again. There were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster\u2019s Fireworks, so that the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners, most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail\u2019s head on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on fire.\n\nHarry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and Hermione. He couldn\u2019t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back on his side, he\u2019d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn\u2019t have to face the second one for three months.\n\n\u201cBlimey, this is heavy,\u201d said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands. \u201cOpen it, Harry, go on! Let\u2019s just see what\u2019s inside it!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to work out the clue on his own,\u201d Hermione said swiftly. \u201cIt\u2019s in the tournament rules. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too,\u201d Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and she grinned rather guiltily.\n\n\u201cYeah, go on, Harry, open it!\u201d several people echoed.\n\nLee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open.\n\nIt was hollow and completely empty \u2014 but the moment Harry opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing, filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick\u2019s deathday party, who had all been playing the musical saw.\n\n\u201cShut it!\u201d Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again. \u201cSounded like a banshee. . . . Maybe you\u2019ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was someone being tortured!\u201d said Neville, who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a prat, Neville, that\u2019s illegal,\u201d said George. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing . . . maybe you\u2019ve got to attack him while he\u2019s in the shower, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWant a jam tart, Hermione?\u201d said Fred.\n\nHermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her. Fred grinned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything to them. It\u2019s the custard creams you\u2019ve got to watch \u2014\u201d\n\nNeville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and spat it out. Fred laughed.\n\n\u201cJust my little joke, Neville. . . .\u201d\n\nHermione took a jam tart. Then she said, \u201cDid you get all this from the kitchens, Fred?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched squeak and imitated a house-elf. \u201c\u2018Anything we can get you, sir, anything at all!\u2019 They\u2019re dead helpful . . . get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you get in there?\u201d Hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voice.\n\n\u201cEasy,\u201d said Fred, \u201cconcealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and \u2014\u201d He stopped and looked suspiciously at her. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Hermione quickly.\n\n\u201cGoing to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are you?\u201d said George. \u201cGoing to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion?\u201d\n\nSeveral people chortled. Hermione didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you go upsetting them and telling them they\u2019ve got to take clothes and salaries!\u201d said Fred warningly. \u201cYou\u2019ll put them off their cooking!\u201d\n\nJust then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canary.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 sorry, Neville!\u201d Fred shouted over all the laughter. \u201cI forgot \u2014 it was the custard creams we hexed \u2014\u201d\n\nWithin a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He even joined in laughing.\n\n\u201cCanary Creams!\u201d Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. \u201cGeorge and I invented them \u2014 seven Sickles each, a bargain!\u201d\n\nIt was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he pulled the curtains of his four-poster shut, Harry set his tiny model of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a point . . . they were all right, really, dragons. . . .\n\nThe start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty though the castle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping Madame Maxime\u2019s horses well provided with their preferred drink of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the corner of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether they hibernate or not,\u201d Hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. \u201cThought we\u2019d jus\u2019 try an\u2019 see if they fancied a kip . . . we\u2019ll jus\u2019 settle \u2019em down in these boxes. . . .\u201d\n\nThere were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor; their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows and fluffy blankets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll jus\u2019 lead \u2019em in here,\u201d Hagrid said, \u201can\u2019 put the lids on, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nBut the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid was soon yelling, \u201cDon\u2019 panic, now, don\u2019 panic!\u201d while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class \u2014 Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle in the lead \u2014 had fled into Hagrid\u2019s cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally, only one skrewt was left.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 frighten him, now!\u201d Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering, over its back. \u201cJus\u2019 try an\u2019 slip the rope \u2019round his sting, so he won\u2019 hurt any o\u2019 the others!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we wouldn\u2019t want that!\u201d Ron shouted angrily as he and Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid\u2019s cabin, still holding the skrewt off with their sparks.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well . . . this does look like fun.\u201d\n\nRita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid\u2019s garden fence, looking in at the mayhem. She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her arm.\n\nHagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewt\u2019s sting and tightened it.\n\n\u201cRita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,\u201d Rita replied, beaming at him. Her gold teeth glinted.\n\n\u201cThought Dumbledore said you weren\u2019 allowed inside the school anymore,\u201d said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.\n\nRita acted as though she hadn\u2019t heard what Hagrid had said.\n\n\u201cWhat are these fascinating creatures called?\u201d she asked, beaming still more widely.\n\n\u201cBlast-Ended Skrewts,\u201d grunted Hagrid.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of them before . . . where do they come from?\u201d\n\nHarry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid\u2019s wild black beard, and his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts from? Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said quickly, \u201cThey\u2019re very interesting, aren\u2019t they? Aren\u2019t they, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting,\u201d said Harry as she stepped on his foot.\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re here, Harry!\u201d said Rita Skeeter as she looked around. \u201cSo you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.\n\n\u201cLovely,\u201d said Rita. \u201cReally lovely. Been teaching long?\u201d she added to Hagrid.\n\nHarry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.\n\n\u201cThis is on\u2019y me second year,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cLovely . . . I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d like to give an interview, would you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures? The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday, as I\u2019m sure you know. We could feature these \u2014 er \u2014 Bang-Ended Scoots.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlast-Ended Skrewts,\u201d Hagrid said eagerly. \u201cEr \u2014 yeah, why not?\u201d\n\nHarry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.\n\n\u201cWell, good-bye, Harry!\u201d Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with Ron and Hermione. \u201cUntil Friday night, then, Hagrid!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll twist everything he says,\u201d Harry said under his breath.\n\n\u201cJust as long as he didn\u2019t import those skrewts illegally or anything,\u201d said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another \u2014 it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore\u2019s never sacked him,\u201d said Ron consolingly. \u201cWorst that can happen is Hagrid\u2019ll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch.\n\nHarry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon; they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and Ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny again. Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths, quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.\n\n\u201cI would think,\u201d she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, \u201cthat some of us\u201d \u2014 she stared very meaningfully at Harry \u2014 \u201cmight be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths . . . and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn ugly old bat in outsize specs?\u201d Ron muttered under his breath.\n\nHarry fought hard to keep his face straight.\n\n\u201cDeath, my dears.\u201d\n\nParvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths, looking horrified.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, \u201cit comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower . . . ever lower over the castle. . . .\u201d\n\nShe stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and obviously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be a bit more impressive if she hadn\u2019t done it about eighty times before,\u201d Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath Professor Trelawney\u2019s room. \u201cBut if I\u2019d dropped dead every time she\u2019s told me I\u2019m going to, I\u2019d be a medical miracle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,\u201d said Ron, chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly. \u201cAt least we didn\u2019t get homework. I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love not working when she is. . . .\u201d\n\nBut Hermione wasn\u2019t at dinner, nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward. The only person in there was Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while, watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry whether he should ask for an autograph \u2014 but then Ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.\n\n\u201cWonder where she\u2019s got to?\u201d Ron said as he and Harry went back to Gryffindor Tower.\n\n\u201cDunno . . . balderdash.\u201d\n\nBut the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady stared down at her, eyebrows raised). \u201cHarry, you\u2019ve got to come \u2014 you\u2019ve got to come, the most amazing thing\u2019s happened \u2014 please \u2014\u201d\n\nShe seized Harry\u2019s arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridor.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you when we get there \u2014 oh come on, quick \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry, intrigued.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t mind me!\u201d the Fat Lady called irritably after them. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize for bothering me! I\u2019ll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, thanks!\u201d Ron shouted over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cHermione, where are we going?\u201d Harry asked, after she had led them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see in a minute!\u201d said Hermione excitedly.\n\nShe turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry\u2019s names. Harry had never been through here before. He and Ron followed Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape\u2019s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of food.\n\n\u201cOh hang on . . .\u201d said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor. \u201cWait a minute, Hermione. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over her face.\n\n\u201cI know what this is about,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl.\n\n\u201cHermione!\u201d said Ron, cottoning on. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to rope us into that spew stuff again!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not!\u201d she said hastily. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not spew, Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cChanged the name, have you?\u201d said Ron, frowning at her. \u201cWhat are we now, then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I\u2019m not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work, I\u2019m not doing it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to!\u201d Hermione said impatiently. \u201cI came down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found \u2014 oh come on, Harry, I want to show you!\u201d\n\nShe seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the huge green pear. It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him inside.\n\nHe had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room, large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room, squealing, \u201cHarry Potter, sir! Harry Potter!\u201d\n\nNext second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.\n\n\u201cD-Dobby?\u201d Harry gasped.\n\n\u201cIt is Dobby, sir, it is!\u201d squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel. \u201cDobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!\u201d\n\nDobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at Harry, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers and feet \u2014 all except the clothes, which were very different.\n\nWhen Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinned a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest, a pair of what looked like children\u2019s soccer shorts, and odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had removed from his own foot and tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The other was covered in pink and orange stripes.\n\n\u201cDobby, what\u2019re you doing here?\u201d Harry said in amazement.\n\n\u201cDobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!\u201d Dobby squealed excitedly. \u201cProfessor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cWinky?\u201d said Harry. \u201cShe\u2019s here too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, yes!\u201d said Dobby, and he seized Harry\u2019s hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them, was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts above.\n\nAt least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them. They were all wearing the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky\u2019s had been, like a toga.\n\nDobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed.\n\n\u201cWinky, sir!\u201d he said.\n\nWinky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her large ears. However, while every one of Dobby\u2019s strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brand-new, Winky was plainly not taking care of her clothes at all. There were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.\n\n\u201cHello, Winky,\u201d said Harry.\n\nWinky\u2019s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as they had done at the Quidditch World Cup.\n\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. \u201cWinky, don\u2019t cry, please don\u2019t . . .\u201d\n\nBut Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand, beamed up at Harry.\n\n\u201cWould Harry Potter like a cup of tea?\u201d he squeaked loudly, over Winky\u2019s sobs.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yeah, okay,\u201d said Harry.\n\nInstantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him, bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.\n\n\u201cGood service!\u201d Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very low and retreated.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been here, Dobby?\u201d Harry asked as Dobby handed around the tea.\n\n\u201cOnly a week, Harry Potter, sir!\u201d said Dobby happily. \u201cDobby came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position, sir, very difficult indeed \u2014\u201d\n\nAt this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a nose dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to stem the flow.\n\n\u201cDobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying to find work!\u201d Dobby squeaked. \u201cBut Dobby hasn\u2019t found work, sir, because Dobby wants paying now!\u201d\n\nThe house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing. Hermione, however, said, \u201cGood for you, Dobby!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, miss!\u201d said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. \u201cBut most wizards doesn\u2019t want a house-elf who wants paying, miss. \u2018That\u2019s not the point of a house-elf,\u2019 they says, and they slammed the door in Dobby\u2019s face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter. . . . Dobby likes being free!\u201d\n\nThe Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from Dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious. Winky, however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her crying.\n\n\u201cAnd then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds out Winky has been freed too, sir!\u201d said Dobby delightedly.\n\nAt this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay facedown on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she said made the slightest difference. Dobby continued with his story, shouting shrilly over Winky\u2019s screeches.\n\n\u201cAnd then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Dobby and Winky find work together?\u2019 Dobby says. \u2018Where is there enough work for two house-elves?\u2019 says Winky. And Dobby thinks, and it comes to him, sir! Hogwarts! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor Dumbledore took us on!\u201d\n\nDobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes again.\n\n\u201cAnd Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not very much!\u201d Hermione shouted indignantly from the floor, over Winky\u2019s continued screaming and fist-beating.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off,\u201d said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening, \u201cbut Dobby beat him down, miss. . . . Dobby likes freedom, miss, but he isn\u2019t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?\u201d Hermione asked kindly.\n\nIf she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furious.\n\n\u201cWinky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!\u201d she squeaked. \u201cWinky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed!\u201d\n\n\u201cAshamed?\u201d said Hermione blankly. \u201cBut \u2014 Winky, come on! It\u2019s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, he was really horrible to you \u2014\u201d\n\nBut at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn\u2019t hear a word, and screeched, \u201cYou is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky!\u201d\n\n\u201cWinky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,\u201d squeaked Dobby confidentially. \u201cWinky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cOh no, sir, no,\u201d said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. \u201c\u2019Tis part of the house-elf\u2019s enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and our silence, sir. We upholds the family\u2019s honor, and we never speaks ill of them \u2014 though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to \u2014 to \u2014\u201d\n\nDobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer. Harry bent forward. Dobby whispered, \u201cHe said we is free to call him a \u2014 a barmy old codger if we likes, sir!\u201d\n\nDobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.\n\n\u201cBut Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,\u201d he said, talking normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped. \u201cDobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?\u201d Harry asked him, grinning.\n\nA slightly fearful look came into Dobby\u2019s immense eyes.\n\n\u201cDobby \u2014 Dobby could,\u201d he said doubtfully. He squared his small shoulders. \u201cDobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were \u2014 were \u2014 bad Dark wizards!\u201d\n\nDobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by his own daring \u2014 then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, \u201cBad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\u201d\n\nHarry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the table.\n\n\u201cThank you, Harry Potter, thank you,\u201d said Dobby breathlessly, rubbing his head.\n\n\u201cYou just need a bit of practice,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cPractice!\u201d squealed Winky furiously. \u201cYou is ought to be ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey isn\u2019t my masters anymore, Winky!\u201d said Dobby defiantly. \u201cDobby doesn\u2019t care what they think anymore!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh you is a bad elf, Dobby!\u201d moaned Winky, tears leaking down her face once more. \u201cMy poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her . . . oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!\u201d She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.\n\n\u201cWinky,\u201d said Hermione firmly, \u201cI\u2019m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you. We\u2019ve seen him, you know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou is seeing my master?\u201d said Winky breathlessly, raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at Hermione. \u201cYou is seeing him here at Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione, \u201che and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Bagman comes too?\u201d squeaked Winky, and to Harry\u2019s great surprise (and Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s too, by the looks on their faces), she looked angry again. \u201cMr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very bad wizard! My master isn\u2019t liking him, oh no, not at all!\u201d\n\n\u201cBagman \u2014 bad?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Winky said, nodding her head furiously. \u201cMy master is telling Winky some things! But Winky is not saying . . . Winky \u2014 Winky keeps her master\u2019s secrets. . . .\u201d\n\nShe dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into her skirt, \u201cPoor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no more!\u201d\n\nThey couldn\u2019t get another sensible word out of Winky. They left her to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages.\n\n\u201cDobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!\u201d he said happily, pointing at his bare chest.\n\n\u201cTell you what, Dobby,\u201d said Ron, who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf, \u201cI\u2019ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don\u2019t mind maroon, do you?\u201d\n\nDobby was delighted.\n\n\u201cWe might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,\u201d Ron told him, \u201cbut it\u2019ll go well with your tea cozy.\u201d\n\nAs they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs. Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and pies.\n\n\u201cThanks a lot!\u201d Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered around the door to say good night. \u201cSee you, Dobby!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?\u201d Dobby asked tentatively.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course you can,\u201d said Harry, and Dobby beamed.\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. \u201cAll these years I\u2019ve been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens \u2014 well, it\u2019s not exactly difficult, is it? They can\u2019t wait to give it away!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves, you know,\u201d said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. \u201cDobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it\u2019ll dawn on them that they want that too!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope they don\u2019t look too closely at Winky,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOh she\u2019ll cheer up,\u201d said Hermione, though she sounded a bit doubtful. \u201cOnce the shock\u2019s worn off, and she\u2019s got used to Hogwarts, she\u2019ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe seems to love him,\u201d said Ron thickly (he had just started on a cream cake).\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t think much of Bagman, though, does she?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWonder what Crouch says at home about him?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably says he\u2019s not a very good Head of Department,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cand let\u2019s face it . . . he\u2019s got a point, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d still rather work for him than old Crouch,\u201d said Ron. \u201cAt least Bagman\u2019s got a sense of humor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let Percy hear you saying that,\u201d Hermione said, smiling slightly.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, Percy wouldn\u2019t want to work for anyone with a sense of humor, would he?\u201d said Ron, now starting on a chocolate eclair. \u201cPercy wouldn\u2019t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby\u2019s tea cozy.\u201d"}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter22": "THE UNEXPECTED TASK\n\n\n\n\nPotter! Weasley! Will you pay attention?\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s irritated voice cracked like a whip through the Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron both jumped and looked up.\n\nIt was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on Professor McGonagall\u2019s desk (Neville\u2019s still had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the blackboard (\u201cDescribe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species Switches\u201d). The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George\u2019s fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin parrot and Harry, a rubber haddock.\n\n\u201cNow that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of Harry\u2019s haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor \u2014 Ron\u2019s parrot\u2019s beak had severed it moments before \u2014 \u201cI have something to say to you all.\n\n\u201cThe Yule Ball is approaching \u2014 a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests. Now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and above \u2014 although you may invite a younger student if you wish \u2014\u201d\n\nLavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle. They both looked around at Harry. Professor McGonagall ignored them, which Harry thought was distinctly unfair, as she had just told off him and Ron.\n\n\u201cDress robes will be worn,\u201d Professor McGonagall continued, \u201cand the ball will start at eight o\u2019clock on Christmas Day, finishing at midnight in the Great Hall. Now then \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class.\n\n\u201cThe Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to \u2014 er \u2014 let our hair down,\u201d she said, in a disapproving voice.\n\nLavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound. Harry could see what was funny this time: Professor McGonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense.\n\n\u201cBut that does NOT mean,\u201d Professor McGonagall went on, \u201cthat we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students. I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way.\u201d\n\nThe bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders.\n\nProfessor McGonagall called above the noise, \u201cPotter \u2014 a word, if you please.\u201d\n\nAssuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock, Harry proceeded gloomily to the teacher\u2019s desk. Professor McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then said, \u201cPotter, the champions and their partners \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat partners?\u201d said Harry.\n\nProfessor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she thought he was trying to be funny.\n\n\u201cYour partners for the Yule Ball, Potter,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cYour dance partners.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.\n\n\u201cDance partners?\u201d He felt himself going red. \u201cI don\u2019t dance,\u201d he said quickly.\n\n\u201cOh yes, you do,\u201d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.\u201d\n\nHarry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails, accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to Uncle Vernon\u2019s work parties.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not dancing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is traditional,\u201d said Professor McGonagall firmly. \u201cYou are a Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard me, Potter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of way.\n\nA week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail. But now that he had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball, he thought he\u2019d rather have another round with the dragon.\n\nHarry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course, because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but he had always been very much in the minority before now. This year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball \u2014 or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite noticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night. . . .\n\n\u201cWhy do they have to move in packs?\u201d Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. \u201cHow\u2019re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?\u201d\n\n\u201cLasso one?\u201d Ron suggested. \u201cGot any idea who you\u2019re going to try?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t answer. He knew perfectly well whom he\u2019d like to ask, but working up the nerve was something else. . . . Cho was a year older than he was; she was very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch player, and she was also very popular.\n\nRon seemed to know what was going on inside Harry\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cListen, you\u2019re not going to have any trouble. You\u2019re a champion. You\u2019ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they\u2019ll be queuing up to go with you.\u201d\n\nIn tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry\u2019s amazement, he turned out to be quite right.\n\nA curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so taken aback he said no before he\u2019d even stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean\u2019s, Seamus\u2019s, and Ron\u2019s taunts about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.\n\n\u201cShe was quite good-looking,\u201d said Ron fairly, after he\u2019d stopped laughing.\n\n\u201cShe was a foot taller than me,\u201d said Harry, still unnerved. \u201cImagine what I\u2019d look like trying to dance with her.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s words about Krum kept coming back to him. \u201cThey only like him because he\u2019s famous!\u201d Harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn\u2019t been a school champion. Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked him.\n\nOn the whole, Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task. He wasn\u2019t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric \u2014 he had an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude for Harry\u2019s tip-off about the dragons. There seemed to be fewer Support Cedric Diggory! badges around too. Draco Malfoy, of course, was still quoting Rita Skeeter\u2019s article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it \u2014 and just to heighten Harry\u2019s feeling of well-being, no story about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019 seem very int\u2019rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh the truth,\u201d Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term. To their very great relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now, and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts.\n\n\u201cShe jus\u2019 wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,\u201d Hagrid continued in a low voice. \u201cWell, I told her we\u2019d been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys. \u2018Never had to tell him off in four years?\u2019 she said. \u2018Never played you up in lessons, has he?\u2019 I told her no, an\u2019 she didn\u2019 seem happy at all. Yeh\u2019d think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course she did,\u201d said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more. \u201cShe can\u2019t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it\u2019ll get boring.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants a new angle, Hagrid,\u201d said Ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs. \u201cYou were supposed to say Harry\u2019s a mad delinquent!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s not!\u201d said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked.\n\n\u201cShe should\u2019ve interviewed Snape,\u201d said Harry grimly. \u201cHe\u2019d give her the goods on me any day. \u2018Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSaid that, did he?\u201d said Hagrid, while Ron and Hermione laughed. \u201cWell, yeh might\u2019ve bent a few rules, Harry, bu\u2019 yeh\u2019re all righ\u2019 really, aren\u2019 you?\u201d\n\n\u201cCheers, Hagrid,\u201d said Harry, grinning.\n\n\u201cYou coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cThough\u2019 I might look in on it, yeah,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly. \u201cShould be a good do, I reckon. You\u2019ll be openin\u2019 the dancin\u2019, won\u2019 yeh, Harry? Who\u2019re you takin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one, yet,\u201d said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn\u2019t pursue the subject.\n\nThe last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere, though Harry didn\u2019t believe half of them \u2014 for instance, that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn\u2019t know, never having had access to a wizard\u2019s wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group.\n\nSome of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Other teachers were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions \u2014 as Binns hadn\u2019t let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like Christmas wasn\u2019t going to put him off. It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy\u2019s cauldron-bottom report. Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too, and Snape, of course, would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry. Staring nastily around at them all, he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term.\n\n\u201cEvil, he is,\u201d Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room. \u201cSpringing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying.\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm . . . you\u2019re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?\u201d said Hermione, looking at him over the top of her Potions notes. Ron was busy building a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack \u2014 a much more interesting pastime than with Muggle cards, because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas, Hermione,\u201d said Harry lazily; he was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire.\n\nHermione looked severely over at him too. \u201cI\u2019d have thought you\u2019d be doing something constructive, Harry, even if you don\u2019t want to learn your antidotes!\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser.\n\n\u201cThat egg!\u201d Hermione hissed.\n\n\u201cCome on, Hermione, I\u2019ve got till February the twenty-fourth,\u201d Harry said.\n\nHe had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadn\u2019t opened it since the celebration party after the first task. There were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant, after all.\n\n\u201cBut it might take weeks to work it out!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cYou\u2019re going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave him alone, Hermione, he\u2019s earned a bit of a break,\u201d said Ron, and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up, singeing his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cNice look, Ron . . . go well with your dress robes, that will.\u201d\n\nIt was Fred and George. They sat down at the table with Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done.\n\n\u201cRon, can we borrow Pigwidgeon?\u201d George asked.\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s off delivering a letter,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause George wants to invite him to the ball,\u201d said Fred sarcastically.\n\n\u201cBecause we want to send a letter, you stupid great prat,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWho d\u2019you two keep writing to, eh?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNose out, Ron, or I\u2019ll burn that for you too,\u201d said Fred, waving his wand threateningly. \u201cSo . . . you lot got dates for the ball yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019d better hurry up, mate, or all the good ones will be gone,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re you going with, then?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cAngelina,\u201d said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron, taken aback. \u201cYou\u2019ve already asked her?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood point,\u201d said Fred. He turned his head and called across the common room, \u201cOi! Angelina!\u201d\n\nAngelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she called back.\n\n\u201cWant to come to the ball with me?\u201d\n\nAngelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look.\n\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face.\n\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d said Fred to Harry and Ron, \u201cpiece of cake.\u201d\n\nHe got to his feet, yawning, and said, \u201cWe\u2019d better use a school owl then, George, come on. . . .\u201d\n\nThey left. Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at Harry.\n\n\u201cWe should get a move on, you know . . . ask someone. He\u2019s right. We don\u2019t want to end up with a pair of trolls.\u201d\n\nHermione let out a sputter of indignation.\n\n\u201cA pair of . . . what, excuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 you know,\u201d said Ron, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019d rather go alone than with \u2014 with Eloise Midgen, say.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer acne\u2019s loads better lately \u2014 and she\u2019s really nice!\u201d\n\n\u201cHer nose is off-center,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOh I see,\u201d Hermione said, bristling. \u201cSo basically, you\u2019re going to take the best-looking girl who\u2019ll have you, even if she\u2019s completely horrible?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yeah, that sounds about right,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls\u2019 staircase without another word.\n\nThe Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best this Christmas. When the decorations went up, Harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school. Everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real, hooting, golden owls, and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them. It was quite something to hear \u201cO Come, All Ye Faithful\u201d sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words. Several times, Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armor, where he had taken to hiding, filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention, all of which were very rude.\n\nAnd still, Harry hadn\u2019t asked Cho to the ball. He and Ron were getting very nervous now, though as Harry pointed out, Ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partner; Harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions.\n\n\u201cI suppose there\u2019s always Moaning Myrtle,\u201d he said gloomily, referring to the ghost who haunted the girls\u2019 toilets on the second floor.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 we\u2019ve just got to grit our teeth and do it,\u201d said Ron on Friday morning, in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress. \u201cWhen we get back to the common room tonight, we\u2019ll both have partners \u2014 agreed?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . okay,\u201d said Harry.\n\nBut every time he glimpsed Cho that day \u2014 during break, and then lunchtime, and once on the way to History of Magic \u2014 she was surrounded by friends. Didn\u2019t she ever go anywhere alone? Could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom? But no \u2014 she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls. Yet if he didn\u2019t do it soon, she was bound to have been asked by somebody else.\n\nHe found it hard to concentrate on Snape\u2019s Potions test, and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient \u2014 a bezoar \u2014 meaning that he received bottom marks. He didn\u2019t care, though; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do. When the bell rang, he grabbed his bag, and hurried to the dungeon door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at dinner,\u201d he said to Ron and Hermione, and he dashed off upstairs.\n\nHe\u2019d just have to ask Cho for a private word, that was all. . . . He hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her, and (rather sooner than he had expected) he found her, emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 Cho? Could I have a word with you?\u201d\n\nGiggling should be made illegal, Harry thought furiously, as all the girls around Cho started doing it. She didn\u2019t, though. She said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and followed him out of earshot of her classmates.\n\nHarry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d he said.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t ask her. He couldn\u2019t. But he had to. Cho stood there looking puzzled, watching him.\n\nThe words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them.\n\n\u201cWangoballwime?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d said Cho.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you \u2014 d\u2019you want to go to the ball with me?\u201d said Harry. Why did he have to go red now? Why?\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Cho, and she went red too. \u201cOh Harry, I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d and she truly looked it. \u201cI\u2019ve already said I\u2019ll go with someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry.\n\nIt was odd; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes, but suddenly he didn\u2019t seem to have any insides at all.\n\n\u201cOh okay,\u201d he said, \u201cno problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d she said again.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThey stood there looking at each other, and then Cho said, \u201cWell \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, \u2019bye,\u201d said Cho, still very red. She walked away.\n\nHarry called after her, before he could stop himself.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re you going with?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 Cedric,\u201d she said. \u201cCedric Diggory.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh right,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHis insides had come back again. It felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence.\n\nCompletely forgetting about dinner, he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower, Cho\u2019s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took. \u201cCedric \u2014 Cedric Diggory.\u201d He had been starting to quite like Cedric \u2014 prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone\u2019s favorite champion. Now he suddenly realized that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didn\u2019t have enough brains to fill an eggcup.\n\n\u201cFairy lights,\u201d he said dully to the Fat Lady \u2014 the password had been changed the previous day.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed, dear!\u201d she trilled, straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him.\n\nEntering the common room, Harry looked around, and to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen-faced in a distant corner. Ginny was sitting with him, talking to him in what seemed to be a low, soothing voice.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Ron?\u201d said Harry, joining them.\n\nRon looked up at Harry, a sort of blind horror in his face.\n\n\u201cWhy did I do it?\u201d he said wildly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what made me do it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHe \u2014 er \u2014 just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him,\u201d said Ginny. She looked as though she was fighting back a smile, but she kept patting Ron\u2019s arm sympathetically.\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what made me do it!\u201d Ron gasped again. \u201cWhat was I playing at? There were people \u2014 all around \u2014 I\u2019ve gone mad \u2014 everyone watching! I was just walking past her in the entrance hall \u2014 she was standing there talking to Diggory \u2014 and it sort of came over me \u2014 and I asked her!\u201d\n\nRon moaned and put his face in his hands. He kept talking, though the words were barely distinguishable.\n\n\u201cShe looked at me like I was a sea slug or something. Didn\u2019t even answer. And then \u2014 I dunno \u2014 I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s part veela,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou were right \u2014 her grandmother was one. It wasn\u2019t your fault, I bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for Diggory and got a blast of it \u2014 but she was wasting her time. He\u2019s going with Cho Chang.\u201d\n\nRon looked up.\n\n\u201cI asked her to go with me just now,\u201d Harry said dully, \u201cand she told me.\u201d\n\nGinny had suddenly stopped smiling.\n\n\u201cThis is mad,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones left who haven\u2019t got anyone \u2014 well, except Neville. Hey \u2014 guess who he asked? Hermione!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, completely distracted by this startling news.\n\n\u201cYeah, I know!\u201d said Ron, some of the color coming back into his face as he started to laugh. \u201cHe told me after Potions! Said she\u2019s always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff \u2014 but she told him she was already going with someone. Ha! As if! She just didn\u2019t want to go with Neville . . . I mean, who would?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d said Ginny, annoyed. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh \u2014\u201d\n\nJust then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole.\n\n\u201cWhy weren\u2019t you two at dinner?\u201d she said, coming over to join them.\n\n\u201cBecause \u2014 oh shut up laughing, you two \u2014 because they\u2019ve both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!\u201d said Ginny.\n\nThat shut Harry and Ron up.\n\n\u201cThanks a bunch, Ginny,\u201d said Ron sourly.\n\n\u201cAll the good-looking ones taken, Ron?\u201d said Hermione loftily. \u201cEloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find someone somewhere who\u2019ll have you.\u201d\n\nBut Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light.\n\n\u201cHermione, Neville\u2019s right \u2014 you are a girl. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh well spotted,\u201d she said acidly.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 you can come with one of us!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d snapped Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d he said impatiently, \u201cwe need partners, we\u2019re going to look really stupid if we haven\u2019t got any, everyone else has . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come with you,\u201d said Hermione, now blushing, \u201cbecause I\u2019m already going with someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not!\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou just said that to get rid of Neville!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh did I?\u201d said Hermione, and her eyes flashed dangerously. \u201cJust because it\u2019s taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn\u2019t mean no one else has spotted I\u2019m a girl!\u201d\n\nRon stared at her. Then he grinned again.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, we know you\u2019re a girl,\u201d he said. \u201cThat do? Will you come now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already told you!\u201d Hermione said very angrily. \u201cI\u2019m going with someone else!\u201d\n\nAnd she stormed off toward the girls\u2019 dormitories again.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s lying,\u201d said Ron flatly, watching her go.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not,\u201d said Ginny quietly.\n\n\u201cWho is it then?\u201d said Ron sharply.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not telling you, it\u2019s her business,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron, who looked extremely put out, \u201cthis is getting stupid. Ginny, you can go with Harry, and I\u2019ll just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Ginny, and she went scarlet too. \u201cI\u2019m going with \u2014 with Neville. He asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought . . . well . . . I\u2019m not going to be able to go otherwise, I\u2019m not in fourth year.\u201d She looked extremely miserable. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go and have dinner,\u201d she said, and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole, her head bowed.\n\nRon goggled at Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s got into them?\u201d he demanded.\n\nBut Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole. The time had come for drastic action.\n\n\u201cWait here,\u201d he said to Ron, and he stood up, walked straight up to Parvati, and said, \u201cParvati? Will you go to the ball with me?\u201d\n\nParvati went into a fit of giggles. Harry waited for them to subside, his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes.\n\n\u201cYes, all right then,\u201d she said finally, blushing furiously.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, in relief. \u201cLavender \u2014 will you go with Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going with Seamus,\u201d said Parvati, and the pair of them giggled harder than ever.\n\nHarry sighed.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you think of anyone who\u2019d go with Ron?\u201d he said, lowering his voice so that Ron wouldn\u2019t hear.\n\n\u201cWhat about Hermione Granger?\u201d said Parvati.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going with someone else.\u201d\n\nParvati looked astonished.\n\n\u201cOoooh \u2014 who?\u201d she said keenly.\n\nHarry shrugged. \u201cNo idea,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what about Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . .\u201d said Parvati slowly, \u201cI suppose my sister might . . . Padma, you know . . . in Ravenclaw. I\u2019ll ask her if you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that would be great,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLet me know, will you?\u201d\n\nAnd he went back over to Ron, feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil\u2019s nose was dead center."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter23": "THE YULE BALL\n\n\n\n\nDespite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays, Harry was in no mood to work when term ended, and spent the week leading up to Christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else. Gryffindor Tower was hardly less crowded now than during term-time; it seemed to have shrunk slightly too, as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual. Fred and George had had a great success with their Canary Creams, and for the first couple of days of the holidays, people kept bursting into feather all over the place. Before long, however, all the Gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution, in case it had a Canary Cream concealed in the center, and George confided to Harry that he and Fred were now working on developing something else. Harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from Fred and George in future. He still hadn\u2019t forgotten Dudley and the Ton-Tongue Toffee.\n\nSnow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now. The pale blue Beauxbatons carriage looked like a large, chilly, frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was Hagrid\u2019s cabin, while the Durmstrang ship\u2019s portholes were glazed with ice, the rigging white with frost. The house-elves down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich, warming stews and savory puddings, and only Fleur Delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about.\n\n\u201cIt is too \u2019eavy, all zis \u2019Ogwarts food,\u201d they heard her saying grumpily as they left the Great Hall behind her one evening (Ron skulking behind Harry, keen not to be spotted by Fleur). \u201cI will not fit into my dress robes!\u201d\n\n\u201cOooh there\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d Hermione snapped as Fleur went out into the entrance hall. \u201cShe really thinks a lot of herself, that one, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione \u2014 who are you going to the ball with?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHe kept springing this question on her, hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it. However, Hermione merely frowned and said, \u201cI\u2019m not telling you, you\u2019ll just make fun of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re joking, Weasley!\u201d said Malfoy, behind them. \u201cYou\u2019re not telling me someone\u2019s asked that to the ball? Not the long-molared Mudblood?\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron both whipped around, but Hermione said loudly, waving to somebody over Malfoy\u2019s shoulder, \u201cHello, Professor Moody!\u201d\n\nMalfoy went pale and jumped backward, looking wildly around for Moody, but he was still up at the staff table, finishing his stew.\n\n\u201cTwitchy little ferret, aren\u2019t you, Malfoy?\u201d said Hermione scathingly, and she, Harry, and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily.\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d said Ron, looking sideways at her, suddenly frowning, \u201cyour teeth . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re different . . . I\u2019ve just noticed. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they are \u2014 did you expect me to keep those fangs Malfoy gave me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean, they\u2019re different to how they were before he put that hex on you. . . . They\u2019re all . . . straight and \u2014 and normal-sized.\u201d\n\nHermione suddenly smiled very mischievously, and Harry noticed it too: It was a very different smile from the one he remembered.\n\n\u201cWell . . . when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk, she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just . . . let her carry on a bit.\u201d She smiled even more widely. \u201cMum and Dad won\u2019t be too pleased. I\u2019ve been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages, but they wanted me to carry on with my braces. You know, they\u2019re dentists, they just don\u2019t think teeth and magic should \u2014 look! Pigwidgeon\u2019s back!\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicle-laden banisters, a scroll of parchment tied to his leg. People passing him were pointing and laughing, and a group of third-year girls paused and said, \u201cOh look at the weeny owl! Isn\u2019t he cute?\u201d\n\n\u201cStupid little feathery git!\u201d Ron hissed, hurrying up the stairs and snatching up Pigwidgeon. \u201cYou bring letters to the addressee! You don\u2019t hang around showing off!\u201d\n\nPigwidgeon hooted happily, his head protruding over Ron\u2019s fist. The third-year girls all looked very shocked.\n\n\u201cClear off!\u201d Ron snapped at them, waving the fist holding Pigwidgeon, who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air. \u201cHere \u2014 take it, Harry,\u201d Ron added in an undertone as the third-year girls scuttled away looking scandalized. He pulled Sirius\u2019s reply off Pigwidgeon\u2019s leg, Harry pocketed it, and they hurried back to Gryffindor Tower to read it.\n\nEveryone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to. Ron, Harry, and Hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow, and Harry read out:\n\nDear Harry,\n\nCongratulations on getting past the Horntail. Whoever put your name in that goblet shouldn\u2019t be feeling too happy right now! I was going to suggest a Conjunctivitis Curse, as a dragon\u2019s eyes are its weakest point \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s what Krum did!\u201d Hermione whispered \u2014 but your way was better, I\u2019m impressed.\n\nDon\u2019t get complacent, though, Harry. You\u2019ve only done one task; whoever put you in for the tournament\u2019s got plenty more opportunity if they\u2019re trying to hurt you. Keep your eyes open \u2014 particularly when the person we discussed is around \u2014 and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble.\n\nKeep in touch, I still want to hear about anything unusual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe sounds exactly like Moody,\u201d said Harry quietly, tucking the letter away again inside his robes. \u201c\u2018Constant vigilance!\u2019 You\u2019d think I walk around with my eyes shut, banging off the walls. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s right, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cyou have still got two tasks to do. You really ought to have a look at that egg, you know, and start working out what it means. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, he\u2019s got ages!\u201d snapped Ron. \u201cWant a game of chess, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d said Harry. Then, spotting the look on Hermione\u2019s face, he said, \u201cCome on, how\u2019m I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on? I won\u2019t even be able to hear the egg over this lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I suppose not,\u201d she sighed, and she sat down to watch their chess match, which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron\u2019s, involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop.\n\nHarry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, and saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose.\n\n\u201cDobby!\u201d Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed. \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby is sorry, sir!\u201d squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth. \u201cDobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 and bring him a present, sir! Harry Potter did say Dobby could come and see him sometimes, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Harry, still breathing rather faster than usual, while his heart rate returned to normal. \u201cJust \u2014 just prod me or something in future, all right, don\u2019t bend over me like that. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry pulled back the curtains around his four-poster, took his glasses from his bedside table, and put them on. His yell had awoken Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville. All of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings, heavy-eyed and tousle-haired.\n\n\u201cSomeone attacking you, Harry?\u201d Seamus asked sleepily.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s just Dobby,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah . . . presents!\u201d said Seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed. Ron, Dean, and Neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some present-opening too. Harry turned back to Dobby, who was now standing nervously next to Harry\u2019s bed, still looking worried that he had upset Harry. There was a Christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy.\n\n\u201cCan Dobby give Harry Potter his present?\u201d he squeaked tentatively.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course you can,\u201d said Harry. \u201cEr . . . I\u2019ve got something for you too.\u201d\n\nIt was a lie; he hadn\u2019t bought anything for Dobby at all, but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks. They were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the Sneakoscope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, \u201cSorry, I forgot to wrap them. . . .\u201d\n\nBut Dobby was utterly delighted.\n\n\u201cSocks are Dobby\u2019s favorite, favorite clothes, sir!\u201d he said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon\u2019s. \u201cI has seven now, sir. . . . But sir . . .\u201d he said, his eyes widening, having pulled both socks up to their highest extent, so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts, \u201cthey has made a mistake in the shop, Harry Potter, they is giving you two the same!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, no, Harry, how come you didn\u2019t spot that?\u201d said Ron, grinning over from his own bed, which was now strewn with wrapping paper. \u201cTell you what, Dobby \u2014 here you go \u2014 take these two, and you can mix them up properly. And here\u2019s your sweater.\u201d\n\nHe threw Dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped, and the hand-knitted sweater Mrs. Weasley had sent. Dobby looked quite overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cSir is very kind!\u201d he squeaked, his eyes brimming with tears again, bowing deeply to Ron. \u201cDobby knew sir must be a great wizard, for he is Harry Potter\u2019s greatest friend, but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit, as noble, as selfless \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re only socks,\u201d said Ron, who had gone slightly pink around the ears, though he looked rather pleased all the same. \u201cWow, Harry \u2014\u201d He had just opened Harry\u2019s present, a Chudley Cannon hat. \u201cCool!\u201d He jammed it onto his head, where it clashed horribly with his hair.\n\nDobby now handed Harry a small package, which turned out to be \u2014 socks.\n\n\u201cDobby is making them himself, sir!\u201d the elf said happily. \u201cHe is buying the wool out of his wages, sir!\u201d\n\nThe left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it; the right sock was green with a pattern of Snitches.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re . . . they\u2019re really . . . well, thanks, Dobby,\u201d said Harry, and he pulled them on, causing Dobby\u2019s eyes to leak with happiness again.\n\n\u201cDobby must go now, sir, we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens!\u201d said Dobby, and he hurried out of the dormitory, waving good-bye to Ron and the others as he passed.\n\nHarry\u2019s other presents were much more satisfactory than Dobby\u2019s odd socks \u2014 with the obvious exception of the Dursleys\u2019, which consisted of a single tissue, an all-time low \u2014 Harry supposed they too were remembering the Ton-Tongue Toffee. Hermione had given Harry a book called Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland; Ron, a bulging bag of Dungbombs; Sirius, a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot; and Hagrid, a vast box of sweets including all Harry\u2019s favorites: Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans, Chocolate Frogs, Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum, and Fizzing Whizbees. There was also, of course, Mrs. Weasley\u2019s usual package, including a new sweater (green, with a picture of a dragon on it \u2014 Harry supposed Charlie had told her all about the Horntail), and a large quantity of homemade mince pies.\n\nHarry and Ron met up with Hermione in the common room, and they went down to breakfast together. They spent most of the morning in Gryffindor Tower, where everyone was enjoying their presents, then returned to the Great Hall for a magnificent lunch, which included at least a hundred turkeys and Christmas puddings, and large piles of Cribbage\u2019s Wizarding Crackers.\n\nThey went out onto the grounds in the afternoon; the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle. Hermione chose to watch Harry and the Weasleys\u2019 snowball fight rather than join in, and at five o\u2019clock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball.\n\n\u201cWhat, you need three hours?\u201d said Ron, looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball, thrown by George, hit him hard on the side of the head. \u201cWho\u2019re you going with?\u201d he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.\n\nThere was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o\u2019clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.\n\n\u201cLairy fights, that\u2019s the one!\u201d she giggled when they gave the password, and she swung forward to let them inside.\n\nHarry, Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory, all of them looking very self-conscious, but none as much as Ron, who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face. There was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them look more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs. It worked fairly well; at least he was now lace-free, although he hadn\u2019t done a very neat job, and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t work out how you two got the best-looking girls in the year,\u201d muttered Dean.\n\n\u201cAnimal magnetism,\u201d said Ron gloomily, pulling stray threads out of his cuffs.\n\nThe common room looked strange, full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black. Parvati was waiting for Harry at the foot of the stairs. She looked very pretty indeed, in robes of shocking pink, with her long dark plait braided with gold, and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to see that she wasn\u2019t giggling.\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 er \u2014 look nice,\u201d he said awkwardly.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cPadma\u2019s going to meet you in the entrance hall,\u201d she added to Ron.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron, looking around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hermione?\u201d\n\nParvati shrugged. \u201cShall we go down then, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common room. Fred winked at Harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole.\n\nThe entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o\u2019clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open. Those people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another. Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over to Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise. She didn\u2019t look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd. \u201cOh no . . .\u201d\n\nHe bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry, because Fleur Delacour was passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, Roger Davies. When they had disappeared, Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhere is Hermione?\u201d he said again.\n\nA group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room. Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in Harry\u2019s opinion made him look like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy\u2019s arm. Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner.\n\nThe oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff. Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn\u2019t know. Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights \u2014 meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.\n\nThen Professor McGonagall\u2019s voice called, \u201cChampions over here, please!\u201d\n\nParvati readjusted her bangles, beaming; she and Harry said \u201cSee you in a minute\u201d to Ron and Padma and walked forward, the chattering crowd parting to let them through. Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim of her hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside; they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down. Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies stationed themselves nearest the doors; Davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having Fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her. Cedric and Cho were close to Harry too; he looked away from them so he wouldn\u2019t have to talk to them. His eyes fell instead on the girl next to Krum. His jaw dropped.\n\nIt was Hermione.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t look like Hermione at all. She had done something with her hair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head. She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow \u2014 or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back. She was also smiling \u2014 rather nervously, it was true \u2014 but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever; Harry couldn\u2019t understand how he hadn\u2019t spotted it before.\n\n\u201cHi, Harry!\u201d she said. \u201cHi, Parvati!\u201d\n\nParvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief. She wasn\u2019t the only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum\u2019s fan club from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing. Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn\u2019t seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her. Ron, however, walked right past Hermione without looking at her.\n\nOnce everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her. They did so, and everyone in the Great Hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the Hall, where the judges were sitting.\n\nThe walls of the Hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost, with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling. The House tables had vanished; instead, there were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people.\n\nHarry concentrated on not tripping over his feet. Parvati seemed to be enjoying herself; she was beaming around at everybody, steering Harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces. He caught sight of Ron and Padma as he neared the top table. Ron was watching Hermione pass with narrowed eyes. Padma was looking sulky.\n\nDumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table, but Karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like Ron\u2019s as he watched Krum and Hermione draw nearer. Ludo Bagman, tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars, was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students; and Madame Maxime, who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk, was applauding them politely. But Mr. Crouch, Harry suddenly realized, was not there. The fifth seat at the table was occupied by Percy Weasley.\n\nWhen the champions and their partners reached the table, Percy drew out the empty chair beside him, staring pointedly at Harry. Harry took the hint and sat down next to Percy, who was wearing brand-new, navy-blue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that Harry thought it ought to be fined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been promoted,\u201d Percy said before Harry could even ask, and from his tone, he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe. \u201cI\u2019m now Mr. Crouch\u2019s personal assistant, and I\u2019m here representing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he come?\u201d Harry asked. He wasn\u2019t looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid to say Mr. Crouch isn\u2019t well, not well at all. Hasn\u2019t been right since the World Cup. Hardly surprising \u2014 overwork. He\u2019s not as young as he was \u2014 though still quite brilliant, of course, the mind remains as great as it ever was. But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry, and then, Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house-elf of his, Blinky, or whatever she was called. Naturally, he dismissed her immediately afterward, but \u2014 well, as I say, he\u2019s getting on, he needs looking after, and I think he\u2019s found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left. And then we had the tournament to arrange, and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with \u2014 that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around \u2014 no, poor man, he\u2019s having a well-earned, quiet Christmas. I\u2019m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place.\u201d\n\nHarry wanted very much to ask whether Mr. Crouch had stopped calling Percy \u201cWeatherby\u201d yet, but resisted the temptation.\n\nThere was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates, but small menus were lying in front of each of them. Harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around \u2014 there were no waiters. Dumbledore, however, looked carefully down at his own menu, then said very clearly to his plate, \u201cPork chops!\u201d\n\nAnd pork chops appeared. Getting the idea, the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too. Harry glanced up at Hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining \u2014 surely it meant plenty of extra work for the house-elves? \u2014 but for once, Hermione didn\u2019t seem to be thinking about S.P.E.W. She was deep in talk with Viktor Krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating.\n\nIt now occurred to Harry that he had never actually heard Krum speak before, but he was certainly talking now, and very enthusiastically at that.\n\n\u201cVell, ve have a castle also, not as big as this, nor as comfortable, I am thinking,\u201d he was telling Hermione. \u201cVe have just four floors, and the fires are lit only for magical purposes. But ve have grounds larger even than these \u2014 though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them. But in summer ve are flying every day, over the lakes and the mountains \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, now, Viktor!\u201d said Karkaroff with a laugh that didn\u2019t reach his cold eyes, \u201cdon\u2019t go giving away anything else, now, or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us!\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled, his eyes twinkling. \u201cIgor, all this secrecy . . . one would almost think you didn\u2019t want visitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Dumbledore,\u201d said Karkaroff, displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent, \u201cwe are all protective of our private domains, are we not? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school\u2019s secrets, and right to protect them?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts\u2019 secrets, Igor,\u201d said Dumbledore amicably. \u201cOnly this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon \u2014 or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.\u201d\n\nHarry snorted into his plate of goulash. Percy frowned, but Harry could have sworn Dumbledore had given him a very small wink.\n\nMeanwhile Fleur Delacour was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to Roger Davies.\n\n\u201cZis is nothing,\u201d she said dismissively, looking around at the sparkling walls of the Great Hall. \u201cAt ze Palace of Beauxbatons, we \u2019ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at Chreestmas. Zey do not melt, of course . . . zey are like \u2019uge statues of diamond, glittering around ze place. And ze food is seemply superb. And we \u2019ave choirs of wood nymphs, \u2019oo serenade us as we eat. We \u2019ave none of zis ugly armor in ze \u2019alls, and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into Beauxbatons, \u2019e would be expelled like zat.\u201d She slapped her hand onto the table impatiently.\n\nRoger Davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face, and he kept missing his mouth with his fork. Harry had the impression that Davies was too busy staring at Fleur to take in a word she was saying.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely right,\u201d he said quickly, slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of Fleur. \u201cLike that. Yeah.\u201d\n\nHarry looked around the Hall. Hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables; he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table. Harry saw him give a small wave, and looking around, saw Madame Maxime return it, her opals glittering in the candlelight.\n\nHermione was now teaching Krum to say her name properly; he kept calling her \u201cHermy-own.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer-my-oh-nee,\u201d she said slowly and clearly.\n\n\u201cHerm-own-ninny.\u201d\n\n\u201cClose enough,\u201d she said, catching Harry\u2019s eye and grinning.\n\nWhen all the food had been consumed, Dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same. Then, with a wave of his wand, all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear, and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall. A set of drums, several guitars, a lute, a cello, and some bagpipes were set upon it.\n\nThe Weird Sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause; they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn. They picked up their instruments, and Harry, who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming, suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out, and that the other champions and their partners were standing up.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Parvati hissed. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to dance!\u201d\n\nHarry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up. The Weird Sisters struck up a slow, mournful tune; Harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor, carefully avoiding catching anyone\u2019s eye (he could see Seamus and Dean waving at him and sniggering), and next moment, Parvati had seized his hands, placed one around her waist, and was holding the other tightly in hers.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have been, Harry thought, revolving slowly on the spot (Parvati was steering). He kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people, and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor, so that the champions were no longer the center of attention. Neville and Ginny were dancing nearby \u2014 he could see Ginny wincing frequently as Neville trod on her feet \u2014 and Dumbledore was waltzing with Madame Maxime. He was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin; however, she moved very gracefully for a woman so large. Mad-Eye Moody was doing an extremely ungainly two-step with Professor Sinistra, who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg.\n\n\u201cNice socks, Potter,\u201d Moody growled as he passed, his magical eye staring through Harry\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 yeah, Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me,\u201d said Harry, grinning.\n\n\u201cHe is so creepy!\u201d Parvati whispered as Moody clunked away. \u201cI don\u2019t think that eye should be allowed!\u201d\n\nHarry heard the final, quavering note from the bagpipe with relief. The Weird Sisters stopped playing, applause filled the hall once more, and Harry let go of Parvati at once.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit down, shall we?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 but \u2014 this is a really good one!\u201d Parvati said as the Weird Sisters struck up a new song, which was much faster.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Harry lied, and he led her away from the dance floor, past Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so exuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury, and over to the table where Ron and Padma were sitting.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Harry asked Ron, sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer.\n\nRon didn\u2019t answer. He was glaring at Hermione and Krum, who were dancing nearby. Padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed, one foot jiggling in time to the music. Every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at Ron, who was completely ignoring her. Parvati sat down on Harry\u2019s other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you, Harry?\u201d Parvati said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, who was now watching Cho and Cedric.\n\n\u201cOh never mind,\u201d snapped Parvati, and she went off with the boy from Beauxbatons. When the song ended, she did not return.\n\nHermione came over and sat down in Parvati\u2019s empty chair. She was a bit pink in the face from dancing.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Harry. Ron didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hermione, fanning herself with her hand. \u201cViktor\u2019s just gone to get some drinks.\u201d\n\nRon gave her a withering look. \u201cViktor?\u201d he said. \u201cHasn\u2019t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?\u201d\n\nHermione looked at him in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ron scathingly, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d\n\nHermione stared at him, then at Harry, who shrugged.\n\n\u201cRon, what \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s from Durmstrang!\u201d spat Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s competing against Harry! Against Hogwarts! You \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014\u201d Ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe Hermione\u2019s crime, \u201cfraternizing with the enemy, that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s mouth fell open.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so stupid!\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cThe enemy! Honestly \u2014 who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive? Who was the one who wanted his autograph? Who\u2019s got a model of him up in their dormitory?\u201d\n\nRon chose to ignore this. \u201cI s\u2019pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he did,\u201d said Hermione, the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened \u2014 trying to get him to join spew, were you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t! If you really want to know, he \u2014 he said he\u2019d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn\u2019t been able to pluck up the courage!\u201d\n\nHermione said this very quickly, and blushed so deeply that she was the same color as Parvati\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cYeah, well \u2014 that\u2019s his story,\u201d said Ron nastily.\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cObvious, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s Karkaroff\u2019s student, isn\u2019t he? He knows who you hang around with. . . . He\u2019s just trying to get closer to Harry \u2014 get inside information on him \u2014 or get near enough to jinx him \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione looked as though Ron had slapped her. When she spoke, her voice quivered.\n\n\u201cFor your information, he hasn\u2019t asked me one single thing about Harry, not one \u2014\u201d\n\nRon changed tack at the speed of light.\n\n\u201cThen he\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll help him find out what his egg means! I suppose you\u2019ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never help him work out that egg!\u201d said Hermione, looking outraged. \u201cNever. How could you say something like that \u2014 I want Harry to win the tournament, Harry knows that, don\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a funny way of showing it,\u201d sneered Ron.\n\n\u201cThis whole tournament\u2019s supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them!\u201d said Hermione hotly.\n\n\u201cNo it isn\u2019t!\u201d shouted Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning!\u201d\n\nPeople were starting to stare at them.\n\n\u201cRon,\u201d said Harry quietly, \u201cI haven\u2019t got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Ron ignored Harry too.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and find Vicky, he\u2019ll be wondering where you are,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call him Vicky!\u201d\n\nHermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor, disappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face.\n\n\u201cAre you going to ask me to dance at all?\u201d Padma asked him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, still glaring after Hermione.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d snapped Padma, and she got up and went to join Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy, who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that Harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a Summoning Charm.\n\n\u201cVare is Herm-own-ninny?\u201d said a voice.\n\nKrum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Ron mulishly, looking up at him. \u201cLost her, have you?\u201d\n\nKrum was looking surly again.\n\n\u201cVell, if you see her, tell her I haff drinks,\u201d he said, and he slouched off.\n\n\u201cMade friends with Viktor Krum, have you, Ron?\u201d\n\nPercy had bustled over, rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous. \u201cExcellent! That\u2019s the whole point, you know \u2014 international magical cooperation!\u201d\n\nTo Harry\u2019s displeasure, Percy now took Padma\u2019s vacated seat. The top table was now empty; Professor Dumbledore was dancing with Professor Sprout, Ludo Bagman with Professor McGonagall; Madame Maxime and Hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students, and Karkaroff was nowhere to be seen. When the next song ended, everybody applauded once more, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman kiss Professor McGonagall\u2019s hand and make his way back through the crowds, at which point Fred and George accosted him.\n\n\u201cWhat do they think they\u2019re doing, annoying senior Ministry members?\u201d Percy hissed, watching Fred and George suspiciously. \u201cNo respect . . .\u201d\n\nLudo Bagman shook off Fred and George fairly quickly, however, and, spotting Harry, waved and came over to their table.\n\n\u201cI hope my brothers weren\u2019t bothering you, Mr. Bagman?\u201d said Percy at once.\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh not at all, not at all!\u201d said Bagman. \u201cNo, they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs. Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing. I\u2019ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko\u2019s Joke Shop. . . .\u201d\n\nPercy didn\u2019t look happy about this at all, and Harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell Mrs. Weasley about this the moment he got home. Apparently Fred and George\u2019s plans had grown even more ambitious lately, if they were hoping to sell to the public. Bagman opened his mouth to ask Harry something, but Percy diverted him.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel the tournament\u2019s going, Mr. Bagman? Our department\u2019s quite satisfied \u2014 the hitch with the Goblet of Fire\u201d \u2014 he glanced at Harry \u2014 \u201cwas a little unfortunate, of course, but it seems to have gone very smoothly since, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Bagman said cheerfully, \u201cit\u2019s all been enormous fun. How\u2019s old Barty doing? Shame he couldn\u2019t come.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time,\u201d said Percy importantly, \u201cbut in the meantime, I\u2019m more than willing to take up the slack. Of course, it\u2019s not all attending balls\u201d \u2014 he laughed airily \u2014 \u201coh no, I\u2019ve had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence \u2014 you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country? And then we\u2019ve been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling. I\u2019ve got a meeting with their Head of Magical Cooperation in the new year \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk,\u201d Ron muttered to Harry, \u201cget away from Percy. . . .\u201d\n\nPretending they wanted more drinks, Harry and Ron left the table, edged around the dance floor, and slipped out into the entrance hall. The front doors stood open, and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps, where they found themselves surrounded by bushes; winding, ornamental paths; and large stone statues. Harry could hear splashing water, which sounded like a fountain. Here and there, people were sitting on carved benches. He and Ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes, but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice.\n\n\u201c. . . don\u2019t see what there is to fuss about, Igor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeverus, you cannot pretend this isn\u2019t happening!\u201d Karkaroff\u2019s voice sounded anxious and hushed, as though keen not to be overheard. \u201cIt\u2019s been getting clearer and clearer for months. I am becoming seriously concerned, I can\u2019t deny it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen flee,\u201d said Snape\u2019s voice curtly. \u201cFlee \u2014 I will make your excuses. I, however, am remaining at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nSnape and Karkaroff came around the corner. Snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart, his expression most ill-natured. Squeals issued from many of the bushes, and dark shapes emerged from them.\n\n\u201cTen points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett!\u201d Snape snarled as a girl ran past him. \u201cAnd ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!\u201d as a boy went rushing after her. \u201cAnd what are you two doing?\u201d he added, catching sight of Harry and Ron on the path ahead. Karkaroff, Harry saw, looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there. His hand went nervously to his goatee, and he began winding it around his finger.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re walking,\u201d Ron told Snape shortly. \u201cNot against the law, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep walking, then!\u201d Snape snarled, and he brushed past them, his long black cloak billowing out behind him. Karkaroff hurried away after Snape. Harry and Ron continued down the path.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s got Karkaroff all worried?\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cAnd since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms?\u201d said Harry slowly.\n\nThey had reached a large stone reindeer now, over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain. The shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench, watching the water in the moonlight. And then Harry heard Hagrid speak.\n\n\u201cMomen\u2019 I saw yeh, I knew,\u201d he was saying, in an oddly husky voice.\n\nHarry and Ron froze. This didn\u2019t sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on, somehow. . . . Harry looked around, back up the path, and saw Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies standing half-concealed in a rosebush nearby. He tapped Ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them, meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed (Fleur and Davies looked very busy to Harry), but Ron, eyes widening in horror at the sight of Fleur, shook his head vigorously, and pulled Harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer.\n\n\u201cWhat did you know, \u2019Agrid?\u201d said Madame Maxime, a purr in her low voice.\n\nHarry definitely didn\u2019t want to listen to this; he knew Hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this (he certainly would have) \u2014 if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly, but that wasn\u2019t really an option. Instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeer\u2019s back, but the beetle just wasn\u2019t interesting enough to block out Hagrid\u2019s next words.\n\n\u201cI jus\u2019 knew . . . knew you were like me. . . . Was it yer mother or yer father?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I don\u2019t know what you mean, \u2019Agrid. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my mother,\u201d said Hagrid quietly. \u201cShe was one o\u2019 the las\u2019 ones in Britain. \u2019Course, I can\u2019 remember her too well . . . she left, see. When I was abou\u2019 three. She wasn\u2019 really the maternal sort. Well . . . it\u2019s not in their natures, is it? Dunno what happened to her . . . might be dead fer all I know. . . .\u201d\n\nMadame Maxime didn\u2019t say anything. And Harry, in spite of himself, took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeer\u2019s antlers, listening. . . . He had never heard Hagrid talk about his childhood before.\n\n\u201cMe dad was broken-hearted when she wen\u2019. Tiny little bloke, my dad was. By the time I was six I could lift him up an\u2019 put him on top o\u2019 the dresser if he annoyed me. Used ter make him laugh. . . .\u201d Hagrid\u2019s deep voice broke. Madame Maxime was listening, motionless, apparently staring at the silvery fountain. \u201cDad raised me . . . but he died, o\u2019 course, jus\u2019 after I started school. Sorta had ter make me own way after that. Dumbledore was a real help, mind. Very kind ter me, he was. . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily.\n\n\u201cSo . . . anyway . . . enough abou\u2019 me. What about you? Which side you got it on?\u201d\n\nBut Madame Maxime had suddenly got to her feet.\n\n\u201cIt is chilly,\u201d she said \u2014 but whatever the weather was doing, it was nowhere near as cold as her voice. \u201cI think I will go in now.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d said Hagrid blankly. \u201cNo, don\u2019 go! I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve never met another one before!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnuzzer what, precisely?\u201d said Madame Maxime, her tone icy.\n\nHarry could have told Hagrid it was best not to answer; he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth, hoping against hope he wouldn\u2019t \u2014 but it was no good.\n\n\u201cAnother half-giant, o\u2019 course!\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201c\u2019Ow dare you!\u201d shrieked Madame Maxime. Her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn; behind him, Harry heard Fleur and Roger fall out of their rosebush. \u201cI \u2019ave nevair been more insulted in my life! \u2019Alf-giant? Moi? I \u2019ave \u2014 I \u2019ave big bones!\u201d\n\nShe stormed away; great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed, angrily pushing aside bushes. Hagrid was still sitting on the bench, staring after her. It was much too dark to make out his expression. Then, after about a minute, he stood up and strode away, not back to the castle, but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Harry said, very quietly to Ron. \u201cLet\u2019s go. . . .\u201d\n\nBut Ron didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Harry, looking at him.\n\nRon looked around at Harry, his expression very serious indeed.\n\n\u201cDid you know?\u201d he whispered. \u201cAbout Hagrid being half-giant?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said, shrugging. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\nHe knew immediately, from the look Ron was giving him, that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the Wizarding world. Brought up by the Dursleys, there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to Harry, but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year. Now, however, he could tell that most wizards would not have said \u201cSo what?\u201d upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain inside,\u201d said Ron quietly, \u201cc\u2019mon. . . .\u201d\n\nFleur and Roger Davies had disappeared, probably into a more private clump of bushes. Harry and Ron returned to the Great Hall. Parvati and Padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of Beauxbatons boys, and Hermione was once more dancing with Krum. Harry and Ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Harry prompted Ron. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with giants?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re . . . they\u2019re . . .\u201d Ron struggled for words. \u201c. . . not very nice,\u201d he finished lamely.\n\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d Harry said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Hagrid!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know there isn\u2019t, but . . . blimey, no wonder he keeps it quiet,\u201d Ron said, shaking his head. \u201cI always thought he\u2019d got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something. Didn\u2019t like to mention it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s it matter if his mother was a giantess?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell . . . no one who knows him will care, \u2019cos they\u2019ll know he\u2019s not dangerous,\u201d said Ron slowly. \u201cBut . . . Harry, they\u2019re just vicious, giants. It\u2019s like Hagrid said, it\u2019s in their natures, they\u2019re like trolls . . . they just like killing, everyone knows that. There aren\u2019t any left in Britain now, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they were dying out anyway, and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors. There\u2019re supposed to be giants abroad, though. . . . They hide out in mountains mostly. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who Maxime thinks she\u2019s kidding,\u201d Harry said, watching Madame Maxime sitting alone at the judges\u2019 table, looking very somber. \u201cIf Hagrid\u2019s half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones . . . the only thing that\u2019s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner, neither of them having any inclination to dance. Harry tried not to watch Cho and Cedric too much; it gave him a strong desire to kick something.\n\nWhen the Weird Sisters finished playing at midnight, everyone gave them a last, loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall. Many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer, but Harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed; as far as he was concerned, the evening hadn\u2019t been much fun.\n\nOut in the entrance hall, Harry and Ron saw Hermione saying good night to Krum before he went back to the Durmstrang ship. She gave Ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking. Harry and Ron followed her, but halfway up the staircase Harry heard someone calling him.\n\n\u201cHey \u2014 Harry!\u201d\n\nIt was Cedric Diggory. Harry could see Cho waiting for him in the entrance hall below.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d said Harry coldly as Cedric ran up the stairs toward him.\n\nCedric looked as though he didn\u2019t want to say whatever it was in front of Ron, who shrugged, looking bad-tempered, and continued to climb the stairs.\n\n\u201cListen . . .\u201d Cedric lowered his voice as Ron disappeared. \u201cI owe you one for telling me about the dragons. You know that golden egg? Does yours wail when you open it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell . . . take a bath, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cTake a bath, and \u2014 er \u2014 take the egg with you, and \u2014 er \u2014 just mull things over in the hot water. It\u2019ll help you think. . . . Trust me.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at him.\n\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d Cedric said, \u201cuse the prefects\u2019 bathroom. Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor. Password\u2019s \u2018pine fresh.\u2019 Gotta go . . . want to say good night \u2014\u201d\n\nHe grinned at Harry again and hurried back down the stairs to Cho.\n\nHarry walked back to Gryffindor Tower alone. That had been extremely strange advice. Why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant? Was Cedric pulling his leg? Was he trying to make Harry look like a fool, so Cho would like him even more by comparison?\n\nThe Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole. Harry had to yell \u201cFairy lights!\u201d before he woke them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common room and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.\n\n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t like it, you know what the solution is, don\u2019t you?\u201d yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger.\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Ron yelled back. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext time there\u2019s a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!\u201d\n\nRon mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls\u2019 staircase to bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, \u201cwell \u2014 that just proves \u2014 completely missed the point \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t say anything. He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now \u2014 but he somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter24": "RITA SKEETER\u2019S SCOOP\n\n\n\n\nEverybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations. Hermione\u2019s hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy\u2019s Hair Potion on it for the ball, \u201cbut it\u2019s way too much bother to do every day,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.\n\nRon and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione didn\u2019t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.\n\n\u201cWell, I thought he must be,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cI knew he couldn\u2019t be pure giant because they\u2019re about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about giants. They can\u2019t all be horrible. . . . It\u2019s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves. . . . It\u2019s just bigotry, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nRon looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he didn\u2019t want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while Hermione wasn\u2019t looking.\n\nIt was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that Christmas was over \u2014 everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous.\n\nThe trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer from this side of Christmas, and he still hadn\u2019t done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn\u2019t. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the egg across the room \u2014 though he hadn\u2019t really expected that to help.\n\nHarry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He, Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task \u2014 and Cedric\u2019s idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn\u2019t need that sort of rubbishy help \u2014 not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term arrived, and Harry set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach, as though he were carrying that around with him too.\n\nSnow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn\u2019t see out of them in Herbology. Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much in this weather, though as Ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that Hagrid\u2019s cabin would catch fire.\n\nWhen they arrived at Hagrid\u2019s cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front door.\n\n\u201cHurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,\u201d she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d said Ron, staring at her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Professor Grubbly-Plank,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cI am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Hagrid?\u201d Harry repeated loudly.\n\n\u201cHe is indisposed,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly.\n\nSoft and unpleasant laughter reached Harry\u2019s ears. He turned; Draco Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class. All of them looked gleeful, and none of them looked surprised to see Professor Grubbly-Plank.\n\n\u201cThis way, please,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode off around the paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed her, looking back over their shoulders at Hagrid\u2019s cabin. All the curtains were closed. Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Hagrid?\u201d Harry said, hurrying to catch up with Professor Grubbly-Plank.\n\n\u201cNever you mind,\u201d she said as though she thought he was being nosy.\n\n\u201cI do mind, though,\u201d said Harry hotly. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201d\n\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn\u2019t hear him. She led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered.\n\nMany of the girls \u201cooooohed!\u201d at the sight of the unicorn.\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d whispered Lavender Brown. \u201cHow did she get it? They\u2019re supposed to be really hard to catch!\u201d\n\nThe unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head.\n\n\u201cBoys keep back!\u201d barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, throwing out an arm and catching Harry hard in the chest. \u201cThey prefer the woman\u2019s touch, unicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does it. . . .\u201d\n\nShe and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching. The moment Professor Grubbly-Plank was out of earshot, Harry turned to Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon\u2019s wrong with him? You don\u2019t think a skrewt \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh he hasn\u2019t been attacked, Potter, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d said Malfoy softly. \u201cNo, he\u2019s just too ashamed to show his big, ugly face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Harry sharply.\n\nMalfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprint.\n\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d he said. \u201cHate to break it to you, Potter. . . .\u201d\n\nHe smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.\n\nDUMBLEDORE\u2019S GIANT MISTAKE\n\nAlbus Dumbledore, eccentric headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. In September of this year, he hired Alastor \u201cMad-Eye\u201d Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody\u2019s well-known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence. Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures.\n\nRubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better-qualified candidates.\n\nAn alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures. While Dumbledore turns a blind eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being \u201cvery frightening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,\u201d says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student. \u201cWe all hate Hagrid, but we\u2019re just too scared to say anything.\u201d\n\nHagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however. In conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed \u201cBlast-Ended Skrewts,\u201d highly dangerous crosses between manticores and fire-crabs. The creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself to be above such petty restrictions.\n\n\u201cI was just having some fun,\u201d he says, before hastily changing the subject.\n\nAs if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not \u2014 as he has always pretended \u2014 a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nBloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror.\n\nWhile many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were killed by Aurors working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Fridwulfa\u2019s son appears to have inherited her brutal nature.\n\nIn a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who\u2019s fall from power \u2014 thereby driving Hagrid\u2019s own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who\u2019s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend \u2014 but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.\n\n\u201cHow did she find out?\u201d he whispered.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t what was bothering Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, \u2018we all hate Hagrid\u2019?\u201d Harry spat at Malfoy. \u201cWhat\u2019s this rubbish about him\u201d \u2014 he pointed at Crabbe \u2014 \u201cgetting a bad bite off a flobberworm? They haven\u2019t even got teeth!\u201d\n\nCrabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.\n\n\u201cWell, I think this should put an end to the oaf\u2019s teaching career,\u201d said Malfoy, his eyes glinting. \u201cHalf-giant . . . and there was me thinking he\u2019d just swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young. . . . None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all. . . . They\u2019ll be worried he\u2019ll eat their kids, ha, ha. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you paying attention over there?\u201d\n\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank\u2019s voice carried over to the boys; the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.\n\n\u201cI hope she stays, that woman!\u201d said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch. \u201cThat\u2019s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like . . . proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about Hagrid?\u201d Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.\n\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d said Parvati in a hard voice. \u201cHe can still be gamekeeper, can\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nParvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.\n\n\u201cThat was a really good lesson,\u201d said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. \u201cI didn\u2019t know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this!\u201d Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under Hermione\u2019s nose.\n\nHermione\u2019s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same as Ron\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHow did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don\u2019t think Hagrid told her?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair, furious. \u201cHe never even told us, did he? I reckon she was so mad he wouldn\u2019t give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting around to get him back.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,\u201d said Hermione quietly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d have seen her in the garden!\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnyway, she\u2019s not supposed to come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s got an Invisibility Cloak,\u201d said Harry, ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. \u201cSort of thing she\u2019d do, isn\u2019t it, hide in bushes listening to people.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike you and Ron did, you mean,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to hear him!\u201d said Ron indignantly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and see him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThis evening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back . . . you do want him back?\u201d he shot at Hermione.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 well, I\u2019m not going to pretend it didn\u2019t make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once \u2014 but I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!\u201d Hermione added hastily, quailing under Harry\u2019s furious stare.\n\nSo that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid\u2019s cabin. They knocked, and Fang\u2019s booming barks answered.\n\n\u201cHagrid, it\u2019s us!\u201d Harry shouted, pounding on the door. \u201cOpen up!\u201d\n\nHagrid didn\u2019t answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the door, whining, but it didn\u2019t open. They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even went and banged on one of the windows, but there was no response.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he avoiding us for?\u201d Hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school. \u201cHe surely doesn\u2019t think we\u2019d care about him being half-giant?\u201d\n\nBut it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn\u2019t see a sign of him all week. He didn\u2019t appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn\u2019t see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity.\n\n\u201cMissing your half-breed pal?\u201d he kept whispering to Harry whenever there was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry\u2019s retaliation. \u201cMissing the elephant-man?\u201d\n\nThere was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very surprised that Harry was going to go.\n\n\u201cI just thought you\u2019d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cReally get to work on that egg.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I \u2014 I reckon I\u2019ve got a pretty good idea what it\u2019s about now,\u201d Harry lied.\n\n\u201cHave you really?\u201d said Hermione, looking impressed. \u201cWell done!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages . . . whereas if he went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade him to come back.\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s mad!\u201d said Harry, staring at Krum\u2019s dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake. \u201cIt must be freezing, it\u2019s January!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot colder where he comes from,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI suppose it feels quite warm to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s still the giant squid,\u201d said Ron. He didn\u2019t sound anxious \u2014 if anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really nice, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not at all like you\u2019d think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he told me.\u201d\n\nRon said nothing. He hadn\u2019t mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.\n\nHarry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.\n\nThe pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn\u2019t there. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with Ron and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t he ever go into the office?\u201d Hermione whispered suddenly. \u201cLook!\u201d\n\nShe pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins. Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing.\n\nIt was indeed odd, Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and therefore no judging to be done. He watched Bagman in the mirror. He was looking strained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, saw Harry, and stood up.\n\n\u201cIn a moment, in a moment!\u201d Harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry, his boyish grin back in place.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you? Been hoping to run into you! Everything going all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, thanks,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?\u201d said Bagman eagerly. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t give us a moment, you two, could you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 okay,\u201d said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table.\n\nBagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam Rosmerta.\n\n\u201cWell, I just thought I\u2019d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail, Harry,\u201d said Bagman. \u201cReally superb.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, but he knew this couldn\u2019t be all that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione. Bagman didn\u2019t seem in any particular rush to spill the beans, though. Harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching him and Harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.\n\n\u201cAbsolute nightmare,\u201d said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing Harry watching the goblins too. \u201cTheir English isn\u2019t too good . . . it\u2019s like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup . . . but at least they used sign language another human could recognize. This lot keep gabbling in Gobbledegook . . . and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It means \u2018pickax.\u2019 I don\u2019t like to use it in case they think I\u2019m threatening them.\u201d\n\nHe gave a short, booming laugh.\n\n\u201cWhat do they want?\u201d Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still watching Bagman very closely.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 well . . .\u201d said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous. \u201cThey . . . er . . . they\u2019re looking for Barty Crouch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are they looking for him here?\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s at the Ministry in London, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . as a matter of fact, I\u2019ve no idea where he is,\u201d said Bagman. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of . . . stopped coming to work. Been absent for a couple of weeks now. Young Percy, his assistant, says he\u2019s ill. Apparently he\u2019s just been sending instructions in by owl. But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone, Harry? Because Rita Skeeter\u2019s still poking around everywhere she can, and I\u2019m willing to bet she\u2019d work up Barty\u2019s illness into something sinister. Probably say he\u2019s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Bagman, looking strained again. \u201cI\u2019ve got people looking, of course . . .\u201d (About time, thought Harry) \u201cand it\u2019s all very strange. She definitely arrived in Albania, because she met her second cousin there. And then she left the cousin\u2019s house to go south and see an aunt . . . and she seems to have vanished without trace en route. Blowed if I can see where she\u2019s got to . . . she doesn\u2019t seem the type to elope, for instance . . . but still. . . . What are we doing, talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to ask you\u201d \u2014 he lowered his voice \u2014 \u201chow are you getting on with your golden egg?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . not bad,\u201d Harry said untruthfully.\n\nBagman seemed to know he wasn\u2019t being honest.\n\n\u201cListen, Harry,\u201d he said (still in a very low voice), \u201cI feel very bad about all this . . . you were thrown into this tournament, you didn\u2019t volunteer for it . . . and if . . .\u201d (his voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean closer to listen) \u201cif I can help at all . . . a prod in the right direction . . . I\u2019ve taken a liking to you . . . the way you got past that dragon! . . . well, just say the word.\u201d\n\nHarry stared up into Bagman\u2019s round, rosy face and his wide, baby-blue eyes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren\u2019t we?\u201d he said, careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules.\n\n\u201cWell . . . well, yes,\u201d said Bagman impatiently, \u201cbut \u2014 come on, Harry \u2014 we all want a Hogwarts victory, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you offered Cedric help?\u201d Harry said.\n\nThe smallest of frowns creased Bagman\u2019s smooth face. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI \u2014 well, like I say, I\u2019ve taken a liking to you. Just thought I\u2019d offer . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, thanks,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut I think I\u2019m nearly there with the egg . . . couple more days should crack it.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman\u2019s help, except that Bagman was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron, Hermione, or Sirius.\n\nBagman looked almost affronted, but couldn\u2019t say much more as Fred and George turned up at that point.\n\n\u201cHello, Mr. Bagman,\u201d said Fred brightly. \u201cCan we buy you a drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . no,\u201d said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, \u201cno, thank you, boys . . .\u201d\n\nFred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.\n\n\u201cWell, I must dash,\u201d he said. \u201cNice seeing you all. Good luck, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him. Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d Ron said, the moment Harry had sat down.\n\n\u201cHe offered to help me with the golden egg,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing that!\u201d said Hermione, looking very shocked. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the judges! And anyway, you\u2019ve already worked it out \u2014 haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . nearly,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!\u201d said Hermione, still looking deeply disapproving. \u201cI hope he\u2019s trying to help Cedric as much!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not, I asked,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWho cares if Diggory\u2019s getting help?\u201d said Ron. Harry privately agreed.\n\n\u201cThose goblins didn\u2019t look very friendly,\u201d said Hermione, sipping her butterbeer. \u201cWhat were they doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking for Crouch, according to Bagman,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s still ill. Hasn\u2019t been into work.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe Percy\u2019s poisoning him,\u201d said Ron. \u201cProbably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he\u2019ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.\u201d\n\nHermione gave Ron a don\u2019t-joke-about-things-like-that look, and said, \u201cFunny, goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They\u2019d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrouch can speak loads of different languages, though,\u201d said Harry. \u201cMaybe they need an interpreter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorrying about poor \u2019ickle goblins, now, are you?\u201d Ron asked Hermione. \u201cThinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins?\u201d\n\n\u201cHa, ha, ha,\u201d said Hermione sarcastically. \u201cGoblins don\u2019t need protection. Haven\u2019t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry and Ron together.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re quite capable of dealing with wizards,\u201d said Hermione, taking another sip of butterbeer. \u201cThey\u2019re very clever. They\u2019re not like house-elves, who never stick up for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-oh,\u201d said Ron, staring at the door.\n\nRita Skeeter had just entered. She was wearing banana-yellow robes today; her long nails were painted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by her paunchy photographer. She bought drinks, and she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby, Harry, Ron, and Hermione glaring at her as she approached. She was talking fast and looking very satisfied about something.\n\n\u201c. . . didn\u2019t seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo? Now, why would that be, do you think? And what\u2019s he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway? Showing them the sights . . . what nonsense . . . he was always a bad liar. Reckon something\u2019s up? Think we should do a bit of digging? \u2018Disgraced Ex-Head of Magical Games and Sports, Ludo Bagman . . . \u2019 Snappy start to a sentence, Bozo \u2014 we just need to find a story to fit it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTrying to ruin someone else\u2019s life?\u201d said Harry loudly.\n\nA few people looked around. Rita Skeeter\u2019s eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d she said, beaming. \u201cHow lovely! Why don\u2019t you come and join \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t come near you with a ten-foot broomstick,\u201d said Harry furiously. \u201cWhat did you do that to Hagrid for, eh?\u201d\n\nRita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.\n\n\u201cOur readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am merely doing my \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho cares if he\u2019s half-giant?\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with him!\u201d\n\nThe whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing.\n\nRita Skeeter\u2019s smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at once; she snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her Quick-Quotes Quill, and said, \u201cHow about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know, Harry? The man behind the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it. Would you call him a father substitute?\u201d\n\nHermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it were a grenade.\n\n\u201cYou horrible woman,\u201d she said, through gritted teeth, \u201cyou don\u2019t care, do you, anything for a story, and anyone will do, won\u2019t they? Even Ludo Bagman \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSit down, you silly little girl, and don\u2019t talk about things you don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione. \u201cI know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl . . . not that it needs it \u2014\u201d she added, eyeing Hermione\u2019s bushy hair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cc\u2019mon, Harry \u2014 Ron . . .\u201d\n\nThey left; many people were staring at them as they went. Harry glanced back as they reached the door. Rita Skeeter\u2019s Quick-Quotes Quill was out; it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be after you next, Hermione,\u201d said Ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street.\n\n\u201cLet her try!\u201d said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage. \u201cI\u2019ll show her! Silly little girl, am I? Oh, I\u2019ll get her back for this. First Harry, then Hagrid . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,\u201d said Ron nervously. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Hermione, she\u2019ll dig up something on you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents don\u2019t read the Daily Prophet. She can\u2019t scare me into hiding!\u201d said Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could do to keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face. \u201cAnd Hagrid isn\u2019t hiding anymore! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him! Come on!\u201d\n\nBreaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road, through the gates flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to Hagrid\u2019s cabin.\n\nThe curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking as they approached.\n\n\u201cHagrid!\u201d Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. \u201cHagrid, that\u2019s enough! We know you\u2019re in there! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, Hagrid! You can\u2019t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you! Hagrid, get out here, you\u2019re just being \u2014\u201d\n\nThe door opened. Hermione said, \u201cAbout t \u2014 !\u201d and then stopped, very suddenly, because she had found herself face-to-face, not with Hagrid, but with Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.\n\n\u201cWe \u2014 er \u2014 we wanted to see Hagrid,\u201d said Hermione in a rather small voice.\n\n\u201cYes, I surmised as much,\u201d said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . um . . . okay,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nShe, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon Harry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry fended off Fang and looked around.\n\nHagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea. He looked a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire.\n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHagrid looked up.\n\n\u201c\u2019Lo,\u201d he said in a very hoarse voice.\n\n\u201cMore tea, I think,\u201d said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat down. There was a slight pause, and then Dumbledore said, \u201cDid you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?\u201d\n\nHermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued, \u201cHermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we still want to know you!\u201d Harry said, staring at Hagrid. \u201cYou don\u2019t think anything that Skeeter cow \u2014 sorry, Professor,\u201d he added quickly, looking at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI have gone temporarily deaf and haven\u2019t any idea what you said, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 right,\u201d said Harry sheepishly. \u201cI just meant \u2014 Hagrid, how could you think we\u2019d care what that \u2014 woman \u2014 wrote about you?\u201d\n\nTwo fat tears leaked out of Hagrid\u2019s beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard.\n\n\u201cLiving proof of what I\u2019ve been telling you, Hagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling. \u201cI have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you, they would have something to say about it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all of \u2019em,\u201d said Hagrid hoarsely. \u201cNot all of \u2019em wan\u2019 me ter stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I\u2019m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,\u201d said Dumbledore, now peering sternly over his half-moon spectacles. \u201cNot a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I haven\u2019t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it. But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh \u2014 yeh\u2019re not half-giant!\u201d said Hagrid croakily.\n\n\u201cHagrid, look what I\u2019ve got for relatives!\u201d Harry said furiously. \u201cLook at the Dursleys!\u201d\n\n\u201cAn excellent point,\u201d said Professor Dumbledore. \u201cMy own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I\u2019m not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome back and teach, Hagrid,\u201d said Hermione quietly, \u201cplease come back, we really miss you.\u201d\n\nHagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard.\n\nDumbledore stood up. \u201cI refuse to accept your resignation, Hagrid, and I expect you back at work on Monday,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will join me for breakfast at eight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon to you all.\u201d\n\nDumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fang\u2019s ears. When the door had shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his dustbin-lid-sized hands. Hermione kept patting his arm, and at last, Hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, \u201cGreat man, Dumbledore . . . great man . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he is,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCan I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp yerself,\u201d said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. \u201cAr, he\u2019s righ\u2019, o\u2019 course \u2014 yeh\u2019re all righ\u2019 . . . I bin stupid . . . my ol\u2019 dad woulda bin ashamed o\u2019 the way I\u2019ve bin behavin\u2019. . . .\u201d More tears leaked out, but he wiped them away more forcefully, and said, \u201cNever shown you a picture of my old dad, have I? Here . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with Hagrid\u2019s crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat on top of Hagrid\u2019s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth \u2014 he looked hardly older than eleven.\n\n\u201cTha\u2019 was taken jus\u2019 after I got inter Hogwarts,\u201d Hagrid croaked. \u201cDad was dead chuffed . . . thought I migh\u2019 not be a wizard, see, \u2019cos me mum . . . well, anyway. \u2019Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really . . . but at least he never saw me expelled. Died, see, in me second year. . . .\n\n\u201cDumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after Dad went. Got me the gamekeeper job . . . trusts people, he does. Gives \u2019em second chances . . . tha\u2019s what sets him apar\u2019 from other Heads, see. He\u2019ll accept anyone at Hogwarts, s\u2019long as they\u2019ve got the talent. Knows people can turn out okay even if their families weren\u2019 . . . well . . . all tha\u2019 respectable. But some don\u2019 understand that. There\u2019s some who\u2019d always hold it against yeh . . . there\u2019s some who\u2019d even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an\u2019 say \u2014 I am what I am, an\u2019 I\u2019m not ashamed. \u2018Never be ashamed,\u2019 my ol\u2019 dad used ter say, \u2018there\u2019s some who\u2019ll hold it against you, but they\u2019re not worth botherin\u2019 with.\u2019 An\u2019 he was right. I\u2019ve bin an idiot. I\u2019m not botherin\u2019 with her no more, I promise yeh that. Big bones . . . I\u2019ll give her big bones.\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another nervously; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast-Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime, but Hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware that he had said anything odd.\n\n\u201cYeh know wha\u2019, Harry?\u201d he said, looking up from the photograph of his father, his eyes very bright, \u201cwhen I firs\u2019 met you, you reminded me o\u2019 me a bit. Mum an\u2019 Dad gone, an\u2019 you was feelin\u2019 like yeh wouldn\u2019 fit in at Hogwarts, remember? Not sure yeh were really up to it . . . an\u2019 now look at yeh, Harry! School champion!\u201d\n\nHe looked at Harry for a moment and then said, very seriously, \u201cYeh know what I\u2019d love, Harry? I\u2019d love yeh ter win, I really would. It\u2019d show \u2019em all . . . yeh don\u2019 have ter be pureblood ter do it. Yeh don\u2019 have ter be ashamed of what yeh are. It\u2019d show \u2019em Dumbledore\u2019s the one who\u2019s got it righ\u2019, lettin\u2019 anyone in as long as they can do magic. How you doin\u2019 with that egg, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Harry. \u201cReally great.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s miserable face broke into a wide, watery smile.\n\n\u201cTha\u2019s my boy . . . you show \u2019em, Harry, you show \u2019em. Beat \u2019em all.\u201d\n\nLying to Hagrid wasn\u2019t quite like lying to anyone else. Harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image of the happy expression on Hagrid\u2019s whiskery face as he had imagined Harry winning the tournament. The incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on Harry\u2019s conscience that evening, and by the time he had got into bed, he had made up his mind \u2014 it was time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric\u2019s hint was worth anything."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter25": "THE EGG AND THE EYE\n\n\n\n\nAs Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to accept more favors from Cedric, he also decided to use the prefects\u2019 bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed.\n\nHarry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would take the Marauder\u2019s Map, which, next to the Cloak, was the most useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom.\n\nOn Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the Cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password (\u201cbanana fritters\u201d). \u201cGood luck,\u201d Ron muttered, climbing into the room as Harry crept out past him.\n\nIt was awkward moving under the Cloak tonight, because Harry had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other. However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry was able to ensure that he wouldn\u2019t run into anyone he wanted to avoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, \u201cPine fresh,\u201d just as Cedric had told him.\n\nThe door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.\n\nHis immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled chandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor. About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pool\u2019s edges, each with a differently colored jewel set into its handle. There was also a diving board. Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a single golden-framed painting on the wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she snored.\n\nHarry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls. Magnificent though the bathroom was \u2014 and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps \u2014 now he was here he couldn\u2019t quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might have been having him on. How on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, the Cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.\n\nHe could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn\u2019t bubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it. One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that Harry thought it would have supported his weight if he\u2019d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water. Harry amused himself for a while turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs. Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size, Harry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water.\n\nIt was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring at the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding.\n\nHarry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn\u2019t been Cedric\u2019s plan \u2014 and then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d try putting it in the water, if I were you.\u201d\n\nHarry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S-bend of a toilet three floors below.\n\n\u201cMyrtle!\u201d Harry said in outrage, \u201cI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not wearing anything!\u201d\n\nThe foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a nasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived.\n\n\u201cI closed my eyes when you got in,\u201d she said, blinking at him through her thick spectacles. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been to see me for ages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . well . . .\u201d said Harry, bending his knees slightly, just to make absolutely sure Myrtle couldn\u2019t see anything but his head, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I? It\u2019s a girls\u2019 one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t used to care,\u201d said Myrtle miserably. \u201cYou used to be in there all the time.\u201d\n\nThis was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found Myrtle\u2019s out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret \u2014 a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.\n\n\u201cI got told off for going in there,\u201d said Harry, which was half-true; Percy had once caught him coming out of Myrtle\u2019s bathroom. \u201cI thought I\u2019d better not come back after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . I see . . .\u201d said Myrtle, picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of way. \u201cWell . . . anyway . . . I\u2019d try the egg in the water. That\u2019s what Cedric Diggory did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you been spying on him too?\u201d said Harry indignantly. \u201cWhat d\u2019you do, sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d said Myrtle, rather slyly, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never come out to speak to anyone before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored,\u201d said Harry darkly. \u201cYou keep your eyes shut!\u201d\n\nHe made sure Myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath, wrapping the towel firmly around his waist, and going to retrieve the egg. Once he was back in the water, Myrtle peered through her fingers and said, \u201cGo on, then . . . open it under the water!\u201d\n\nHarry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it . . . and this time, it did not wail. A gurgling song was coming out of it, a song whose words he couldn\u2019t distinguish through the water.\n\n\u201cYou need to put your head under too,\u201d said Myrtle, who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around. \u201cGo on!\u201d\n\nHarry took a great breath and slid under the surface \u2014 and now, sitting on the marble bottom of the bubble-filled bath, he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his hands:\n\n\u201cCome seek us where our voices sound,\n\nWe cannot sing above the ground,\n\nAnd while you\u2019re searching, ponder this:\n\nWe\u2019ve taken what you\u2019ll sorely miss,\n\nAn hour long you\u2019ll have to look,\n\nAnd to recover what we took,\n\nBut past an hour \u2014 the prospect\u2019s black,\n\nToo late, it\u2019s gone, it won\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface, shaking his hair out of his eyes.\n\n\u201cHear it?\u201d said Myrtle.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . \u2018Come seek us where our voices sound . . .\u2019 and if I need persuading . . . hang on, I need to listen again. . . .\u201d\n\nHe sank back beneath the water. It took three more underwater renditions of the egg\u2019s song before Harry had it memorized; then he trod water for a while, thinking hard, while Myrtle sat and watched him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go and look for people who can\u2019t use their voices above the ground. . . .\u201d he said slowly. \u201cEr . . . who could that be?\u201d\n\n\u201cSlow, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nHe had never seen Moaning Myrtle so cheerful, apart from the day when a dose of Polyjuice Potion had given Hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat. Harry stared around the bathroom, thinking . . . if the voices could only be heard underwater, then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures. He ran this theory past Myrtle, who smirked at him.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what Diggory thought,\u201d she said. \u201cHe lay there talking to himself for ages about it. Ages and ages . . . nearly all the bubbles had gone. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderwater . . .\u201d Harry said slowly. \u201cMyrtle . . . what lives in the lake, apart from the giant squid?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh all sorts,\u201d she said. \u201cI sometimes go down there . . . sometimes don\u2019t have any choice, if someone flushes my toilet when I\u2019m not expecting it. . . .\u201d\n\nTrying not to think about Moaning Myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet, Harry said, \u201cWell, does anything in there have a human voice? Hang on \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall.\n\n\u201cMyrtle, there aren\u2019t merpeople in there, are there?\u201d\n\n\u201cOooh, very good,\u201d she said, her thick glasses twinkling, \u201cit took Diggory much longer than that! And that was with her awake too\u201d \u2014 Myrtle jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face \u2014 \u201cgiggling and showing off and flashing her fins. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Harry excitedly. \u201cThe second task\u2019s to go and find the merpeople in the lake and . . . and . . .\u201d\n\nBut he suddenly realized what he was saying, and he felt the excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach. He wasn\u2019t a very good swimmer; he\u2019d never had much practice. Dudley had had lessons in his youth, but Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, no doubt hoping that Harry would drown one day, hadn\u2019t bothered to give him any. A couple of lengths of this bath were all very well, but that lake was very large, and very deep . . . and merpeople would surely live right at the bottom. . . .\n\n\u201cMyrtle,\u201d Harry said slowly, \u201chow am I supposed to breathe?\u201d\n\nAt this, Myrtle\u2019s eyes filled with sudden tears again.\n\n\u201cTactless!\u201d she muttered, groping in her robes for a handkerchief.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s tactless?\u201d said Harry, bewildered.\n\n\u201cTalking about breathing in front of me!\u201d she said shrilly, and her voice echoed loudly around the bathroom. \u201cWhen I can\u2019t . . . when I haven\u2019t . . . not for ages . . .\u201d\n\nShe buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly. Harry remembered how touchy Myrtle had always been about being dead, but none of the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2014 I just forgot . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, very easy to forget Myrtle\u2019s dead,\u201d said Myrtle, gulping, looking at him out of swollen eyes. \u201cNobody missed me even when I was alive. Took them hours and hours to find my body \u2014 I know, I was sitting there waiting for them. Olive Hornby came into the bathroom \u2014 \u2018Are you in here again, sulking, Myrtle?\u2019 she said, \u2018because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you \u2014\u2019 And then she saw my body . . . ooooh, she didn\u2019t forget it until her dying day, I made sure of that . . . followed her around and reminded her, I did. I remember at her brother\u2019s wedding \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Harry wasn\u2019t listening; he was thinking about the merpeople\u2019s song again. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken what you\u2019ll sorely miss.\u201d That sounded as though they were going to steal something of his, something he had to get back. What were they going to take?\n\n\u201c\u2014 and then, of course, she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me stalking her, so I had to come back here and live in my toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Harry vaguely. \u201cWell, I\u2019m a lot further on than I was. . . . Shut your eyes again, will you? I\u2019m getting out.\u201d\n\nHe retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath, climbed out, dried himself, and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again.\n\n\u201cWill you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime?\u201d Moaning Myrtle asked mournfully as Harry picked up the Invisibility Cloak.\n\n\u201cEr . . . I\u2019ll try,\u201d Harry said, though privately thinking the only way he\u2019d be visiting Myrtle\u2019s bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked. \u201cSee you, Myrtle . . . thanks for your help.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Bye, \u2019bye,\u201d she said gloomily, and as Harry put on the Invisibility Cloak he saw her zoom back up the tap.\n\nOut in the dark corridor, Harry examined the Marauder\u2019s Map to check that the coast was still clear. Yes, the dots belonging to Filch and his cat, Mrs. Norris, were safely in their office . . . nothing else seemed to be moving apart from Peeves, though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above. . . . Harry had taken his first step back toward Gryffindor Tower when something else on the map caught his eye . . . something distinctly odd.\n\nPeeves was not the only thing that was moving. A single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom left-hand corner \u2014 Snape\u2019s office. But the dot wasn\u2019t labeled \u201cSeverus Snape\u201d . . . it was Bartemius Crouch.\n\nHarry stared at the dot. Mr. Crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to come to the Yule Ball \u2014 so what was he doing, sneaking into Hogwarts at one o\u2019clock in the morning? Harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room, pausing here and there. . . .\n\nHarry hesitated, thinking . . . and then his curiosity got the better of him. He turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase. He was going to see what Crouch was up to.\n\nHarry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of his pajamas. He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take him down two floors. He kept glancing down at the map, wondering . . . It just didn\u2019t seem in character, somehow, for correct, law-abiding Mr. Crouch to be sneaking around somebody else\u2019s office this late at night. . . .\n\nAnd then, halfway down the staircase, not thinking about what he was doing, not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of Mr. Crouch, Harry\u2019s leg suddenly sank right through the trick step Neville always forgot to jump. He gave an ungainly wobble, and the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm. He lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step \u2014 the Invisibility Cloak slipped \u2014 Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder\u2019s Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn\u2019t reach it.\n\nThe golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase, burst open, and began wailing loudly in the corridor below. Harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the Marauder\u2019s Map, to wipe it blank, but it was too far away to reach \u2014\n\nPulling the Cloak back over himself, Harry straightened up, listening hard with his eyes screwed up with fear . . . and, almost immediately \u2014\n\n\u201cPEEVES!\u201d\n\nIt was the unmistakable hunting cry of Filch the caretaker. Harry could hear his rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer, his wheezy voice raised in fury.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this racket? Wake up the whole castle, will you? I\u2019ll have you, Peeves, I\u2019ll have you, you\u2019ll . . . and what is this?\u201d\n\nFilch\u2019s footsteps halted; there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped \u2014 Filch had picked up the egg and closed it. Harry stood very still, one leg still jammed tightly in the magical step, listening. Any moment now, Filch was going to pull aside the tapestry, expecting to see Peeves . . . and there would be no Peeves . . . but if he came up the stairs, he would spot the Marauder\u2019s Map . . . and Invisibility Cloak or not, the map would show \u201cHarry Potter\u201d standing exactly where he was.\n\n\u201cEgg?\u201d Filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs. \u201cMy sweet!\u201d \u2014 Mrs. Norris was obviously with him \u2014 \u201cThis is a Triwizard clue! This belongs to a school champion!\u201d\n\nHarry felt sick; his heart was hammering very fast \u2014\n\n\u201cPEEVES!\u201d Filch roared gleefully. \u201cYou\u2019ve been stealing!\u201d\n\nHe ripped back the tapestry below, and Harry saw his horrible, pouchy face and bulging, pale eyes staring up the dark and (to Filch) deserted staircase.\n\n\u201cHiding, are you?\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m coming to get you, Peeves. . . . You\u2019ve gone and stolen a Triwizard clue, Peeves. . . . Dumbledore\u2019ll have you out of here for this, you filthy, pilfering poltergeist. . . .\u201d\n\nFilch started to climb the stairs, his scrawny, dust-colored cat at his heels. Mrs. Norris\u2019s lamp-like eyes, so very like her master\u2019s, were fixed directly upon Harry. He had had occasion before now to wonder whether the Invisibility Cloak worked on cats. . . . Sick with apprehension, he watched Filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown \u2014 he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free, but it merely sank a few more inches \u2014 any second now, Filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him \u2014\n\n\u201cFilch? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nFilch stopped a few steps below Harry and turned. At the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make Harry\u2019s situation worse: Snape. He was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Peeves, Professor,\u201d Filch whispered malevolently. \u201cHe threw this egg down the stairs.\u201d\n\nSnape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside Filch. Harry gritted his teeth, convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second. . . .\n\n\u201cPeeves?\u201d said Snape softly, staring at the egg in Filch\u2019s hands. \u201cBut Peeves couldn\u2019t get into my office. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThis egg was in your office, Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cI heard banging and wailing \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Professor, that was the egg \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 I was coming to investigate \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 Peeves threw it, Professor \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and when I passed my office, I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar! Somebody has been searching it!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Peeves couldn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know he couldn\u2019t, Filch!\u201d Snape snapped again. \u201cI seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break!\u201d Snape looked up the stairs, straight through Harry, and then down into the corridor below. \u201cI want you to come and help me search for the intruder, Filch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 yes, Professor \u2014 but \u2014\u201d\n\nFilch looked yearningly up the stairs, right through Harry, who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering Peeves. Go, Harry pleaded with him silently, go with Snape . . . go . . . Mrs. Norris was peering around Filch\u2019s legs. . . . Harry had the distinct impression that she could smell him. . . . Why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foam?\n\n\u201cThe thing is, Professor,\u201d said Filch plaintively, \u201cthe headmaster will have to listen to me this time. Peeves has been stealing from a student, it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFilch, I don\u2019t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist; it\u2019s my office that\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\nClunk. Clunk. Clunk.\n\nSnape stopped talking very abruptly. He and Filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Mad-Eye Moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads. Moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual.\n\n\u201cPajama party, is it?\u201d he growled up the stairs.\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape and I heard noises, Professor,\u201d said Filch at once. \u201cPeeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual \u2014 and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Snape hissed to Filch.\n\nMoody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs. Harry saw Moody\u2019s magical eye travel over Snape, and then, unmistakably, onto himself.\n\nHarry\u2019s heart gave a horrible jolt. Moody could see through Invisibility Cloaks . . . he alone could see the full strangeness of the scene: Snape in his nightshirt, Filch clutching the egg, and he, Harry, trapped in the stairs behind them. Moody\u2019s lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise. For a few seconds, he and Harry stared straight into each other\u2019s eyes. Then Moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon Snape again.\n\n\u201cDid I hear that correctly, Snape?\u201d he asked slowly. \u201cSomeone broke into your office?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unimportant,\u201d said Snape coldly.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d growled Moody, \u201cit is very important. Who\u2019d want to break into your office?\u201d\n\n\u201cA student, I daresay,\u201d said Snape. Harry could see a vein flickering horribly on Snape\u2019s greasy temple. \u201cIt has happened before. Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard . . . students attempting illicit mixtures, no doubt. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cReckon they were after potion ingredients, eh?\u201d said Moody. \u201cNot hiding anything else in your office, are you?\u201d\n\nHarry saw the edge of Snape\u2019s sallow face turn a nasty brick color, the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly.\n\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m hiding nothing, Moody,\u201d he said in a soft and dangerous voice, \u201cas you\u2019ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself.\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s face twisted into a smile. \u201cAuror\u2019s privilege, Snape. Dumbledore told me to keep an eye \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore happens to trust me,\u201d said Snape through clenched teeth. \u201cI refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course Dumbledore trusts you,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cHe\u2019s a trusting man, isn\u2019t he? Believes in second chances. But me \u2014 I say there are spots that don\u2019t come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, d\u2019you know what I mean?\u201d\n\nSnape suddenly did something very strange. He seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand, as though something on it had hurt him.\n\nMoody laughed. \u201cGet back to bed, Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the authority to send me anywhere!\u201d Snape hissed, letting go of his arm as though angry with himself. \u201cI have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do!\u201d\n\n\u201cProwl away,\u201d said Moody, but his voice was full of menace. \u201cI look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time. . . . You\u2019ve dropped something, by the way. . . .\u201d\n\nWith a stab of horror, Harry saw Moody point at the Marauder\u2019s Map, still lying on the staircase six steps below him. As Snape and Filch both turned to look at it, Harry threw caution to the winds; he raised his arms under the Cloak and waved furiously at Moody to attract his attention, mouthing \u201cIt\u2019s mine! Mine!\u201d\n\nSnape had reached out for it, a horrible expression of dawning comprehension on his face \u2014\n\n\u201cAccio Parchment!\u201d\n\nThe map flew up into the air, slipped through Snape\u2019s outstretched fingers, and soared down the stairs into Moody\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cMy mistake,\u201d Moody said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s mine \u2014 must\u2019ve dropped it earlier \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Snape\u2019s black eyes were darting from the egg in Filch\u2019s arms to the map in Moody\u2019s hand, and Harry could tell he was putting two and two together, as only Snape could. . . .\n\n\u201cPotter,\u201d he said quietly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Moody calmly, folding up the map and pocketing it.\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d Snape snarled, and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where Harry was, as though he could suddenly see him. \u201cThat egg is Potter\u2019s egg. That piece of parchment belongs to Potter. I have seen it before, I recognize it! Potter is here! Potter, in his Invisibility Cloak!\u201d\n\nSnape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs; Harry could have sworn his over-large nostrils were dilating, trying to sniff Harry out \u2014 trapped, Harry leaned backward, trying to avoid Snape\u2019s fingertips, but any moment now \u2014\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, Snape!\u201d barked Moody, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning what?\u201d Snape turned again to look at Moody, his hands still outstretched, inches from Harry\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cMeaning that Dumbledore\u2019s very interested to know who\u2019s got it in for that boy!\u201d said Moody, limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs. \u201cAnd so am I, Snape . . . very interested. . . .\u201d The torchlight flickered across his mangled face, so that the scars, and the chunk missing from his nose, looked deeper and darker than ever.\n\nSnape was looking down at Moody, and Harry couldn\u2019t see the expression on his face. For a moment, nobody moved or said anything. Then Snape slowly lowered his hands.\n\n\u201cI merely thought,\u201d said Snape, in a voice of forced calm, \u201cthat if Potter was wandering around after hours again . . . it\u2019s an unfortunate habit of his . . . he should be stopped. For \u2014 for his own safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, I see,\u201d said Moody softly. \u201cGot Potter\u2019s best interests at heart, have you?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Snape and Moody were still staring at each other. Mrs. Norris gave a loud meow, still peering around Filch\u2019s legs, looking for the source of Harry\u2019s bubble-bath smell.\n\n\u201cI think I will go back to bed,\u201d Snape said curtly.\n\n\u201cBest idea you\u2019ve had all night,\u201d said Moody. \u201cNow, Filch, if you\u2019ll just give me that egg \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Filch, clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son. \u201cProfessor Moody, this is evidence of Peeves\u2019 treachery!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the property of the champion he stole it from,\u201d said Moody. \u201cHand it over, now.\u201d\n\nSnape swept downstairs and passed Moody without another word. Filch made a chirruping noise to Mrs. Norris, who stared blankly at Harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master. Still breathing very fast, Harry heard Snape walking away down the corridor; Filch handed Moody the egg and disappeared from view too, muttering to Mrs. Norris. \u201cNever mind, my sweet . . . we\u2019ll see Dumbledore in the morning . . . tell him what Peeves was up to. . . .\u201d\n\nA door slammed. Harry was left staring down at Moody, who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him, a dull clunk on every other step.\n\n\u201cClose shave, Potter,\u201d he muttered.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . I \u2014 er . . . thanks,\u201d said Harry weakly.\n\n\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d said Moody, drawing the Marauder\u2019s Map out of his pocket and unfolding it.\n\n\u201cMap of Hogwarts,\u201d said Harry, hoping Moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon; his leg was really hurting him.\n\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s beard,\u201d Moody whispered, staring at the map, his magical eye going haywire. \u201cThis . . . this is some map, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s . . . quite useful,\u201d Harry said. His eyes were starting to water from the pain. \u201cEr \u2014 Professor Moody, d\u2019you think you could help me \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh! Yes . . . yes, of course . . .\u201d\n\nMoody took hold of Harry\u2019s arms and pulled; Harry\u2019s leg came free of the trick step, and he climbed onto the one above it. Moody was still gazing at the map.\n\n\u201cPotter . . .\u201d he said slowly, \u201cyou didn\u2019t happen, by any chance, to see who broke into Snape\u2019s office, did you? On this map, I mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . yeah, I did . . .\u201d Harry admitted. \u201cIt was Mr. Crouch.\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map. He looked suddenly alarmed.\n\n\u201cCrouch?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re sure, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s not here anymore,\u201d said Moody, his eye still whizzing over the map. \u201cCrouch . . . that\u2019s very \u2014 very interesting. . . .\u201d\n\nHe said nothing for almost a minute, still staring at the map. Harry could tell that this news meant something to Moody and very much wanted to know what it was. He wondered whether he dared ask. Moody scared him slightly . . . yet Moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble. . . .\n\n\u201cEr . . . Professor Moody . . . why d\u2019you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snape\u2019s office?\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s magical eye left the map and fixed, quivering, upon Harry. It was a penetrating glare, and Harry had the impression that Moody was sizing him up, wondering whether to answer or not, or how much to tell him.\n\n\u201cPut it this way, Potter,\u201d Moody muttered finally, \u201cthey say old Mad-Eye\u2019s obsessed with catching Dark wizards . . . but I\u2019m nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 compared to Barty Crouch.\u201d\n\nHe continued to stare at the map. Harry was burning to know more.\n\n\u201cProfessor Moody?\u201d he said again. \u201cD\u2019you think . . . could this have anything to do with . . . maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there\u2019s something going on. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d said Moody sharply.\n\nHarry wondered how much he dare say. He didn\u2019t want Moody to guess that he had a source of information outside Hogwarts; that might lead to tricky questions about Sirius.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry muttered, \u201codd stuff\u2019s been happening lately, hasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s been in the Daily Prophet . . . the Dark Mark at the World Cup, and the Death Eaters and everything. . . .\u201d\n\nBoth of Moody\u2019s mismatched eyes widened.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sharp boy, Potter,\u201d he said. His magical eye roved back to the Marauder\u2019s Map. \u201cCrouch could be thinking along those lines,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cVery possible . . . there have been some funny rumors flying around lately \u2014 helped along by Rita Skeeter, of course. It\u2019s making a lot of people nervous, I reckon.\u201d A grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth. \u201cOh if there\u2019s one thing I hate,\u201d he muttered, more to himself than to Harry, and his magical eye was fixed on the left-hand corner of the map, \u201cit\u2019s a Death Eater who walked free. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stared at him. Could Moody possibly mean what Harry thought he meant?\n\n\u201cAnd now I want to ask you a question, Potter,\u201d said Moody in a more businesslike tone.\n\nHarry\u2019s heart sank; he had thought this was coming. Moody was going to ask where he had got this map, which was a very dubious magical object \u2014 and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him, but his own father, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor Lupin, their last Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody waved the map in front of Harry, who braced himself \u2014\n\n\u201cCan I borrow this?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe was very fond of his map, but on the other hand, he was extremely relieved that Moody wasn\u2019t asking where he\u2019d got it, and there was no doubt that he owed Moody a favor.\n\n\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood boy,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cI can make good use of this . . . this might be exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for. . . . Right, bed, Potter, come on, now. . . .\u201d\n\nThey climbed to the top of the stairs together, Moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before. They walked in silence to the door of Moody\u2019s office, where he stopped and looked up at Harry.\n\n\u201cYou ever thought of a career as an Auror, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, taken aback.\n\n\u201cYou want to consider it,\u201d said Moody, nodding and looking at Harry thoughtfully. \u201cYes, indeed . . . and incidentally . . . I\u2019m guessing you weren\u2019t just taking that egg for a walk tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 no,\u201d said Harry, grinning. \u201cI\u2019ve been working out the clue.\u201d\n\nMoody winked at him, his magical eye going haywire again.\n\n\u201cNothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas, Potter. . . . See you in the morning. . . .\u201d\n\nHe went back into his office, staring down at the Marauder\u2019s Map again, and closed the door behind him.\n\nHarry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant. . . . Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he think Snape was concealing in his office?\n\nAnd Moody thought he, Harry, ought to be an Auror! Interesting idea . . . but somehow, Harry thought, as he got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later, the egg and the Cloak now safely back in his trunk, he thought he\u2019d like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter26": "THE SECOND TASK\n\n\n\n\nYou said you\u2019d already worked out that egg clue!\u201d said Hermione indignantly.\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down!\u201d said Harry crossly. \u201cI just need to \u2014 sort of fine-tune it, all right?\u201d\n\nHe, Ron, and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves. They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today \u2014 the Banishing Charm. Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room, Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice, the theory being that these wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone if they went off target. It was a good theory, but it wasn\u2019t working very well. Neville\u2019s aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room \u2014 Professor Flitwick, for instance.\n\n\u201cJust forget the egg for a minute, all right?\u201d Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, landing on top of a large cabinet. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you about Snape and Moody. . . .\u201d\n\nThis class was an ideal cover for a private conversation, as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention. Harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour.\n\n\u201cSnape said Moody\u2019s searched his office as well?\u201d Ron whispered, his eyes alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand (it soared into the air and knocked Parvati\u2019s hat off). \u201cWhat . . . d\u2019you reckon Moody\u2019s here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I dunno if that\u2019s what Dumbledore asked him to do, but he\u2019s definitely doing it,\u201d said Harry, waving his wand without paying much attention, so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk. \u201cMoody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he\u2019s giving him a second chance or something. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron, his eyes widening, his next cushion spinning high into the air, ricocheting off the chandelier, and dropping heavily onto Flitwick\u2019s desk. \u201cHarry . . . maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Ron,\u201d said Hermione, shaking her head skeptically, \u201cwe thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before, and it turned out he was saving Harry\u2019s life, remember?\u201d\n\nShe Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at. Harry looked at Hermione, thinking . . . it was true that Snape had saved his life once, but the odd thing was, Snape definitely loathed him, just as he\u2019d loathed Harry\u2019s father when they had been at school together. Snape loved taking points from Harry, and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments, or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what Moody says,\u201d Hermione went on. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s not stupid. He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin, even though loads of people wouldn\u2019t have given them jobs, so why shouldn\u2019t he be right about Snape, even if Snape is a bit \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 evil,\u201d said Ron promptly. \u201cCome on, Hermione, why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill?\u201d said Hermione, ignoring Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit funny, isn\u2019t it, that he can\u2019t manage to come to the Yule Ball, but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t like Crouch because of that elf, Winky,\u201d said Ron, sending a cushion soaring into the window.\n\n\u201cYou just want to think Snape\u2019s up to something,\u201d said Hermione, sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box.\n\n\u201cI just want to know what Snape did with his first chance, if he\u2019s on his second one,\u201d said Harry grimly, and his cushion, to his very great surprise, flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione\u2019s.\n\nObedient to Sirius\u2019s wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking into Snape\u2019s office, and Moody and Snape\u2019s conversation. Then Harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him: how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty-fourth of February.\n\nRon quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again \u2014 Harry had explained about Aqua-Lungs, and Ron couldn\u2019t see why Harry shouldn\u2019t Summon one from the nearest Muggle town. Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-Lung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy \u2014 it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua-Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cOf course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cIf only we\u2019d done human Transfiguration already! But I don\u2019t think we start that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI s\u2019pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody; he might do it for me. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into, though,\u201d said Hermione seriously. \u201cNo, I think your best chance is some sort of charm.\u201d\n\nSo Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends \u2014 though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help \u2014 they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.\n\nFamiliar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again. The lake, which Harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds, drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window, a great, iron-gray mass of chilly water, whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon.\n\nJust as it had before he faced the Horntail, time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra-fast. There was a week to go before February the twenty-fourth (there was still time) . . . there were five days to go (he was bound to find something soon) . . . three days to go (please let me find something . . . please) . . .\n\nWith two days left, Harry started to go off food again. The only good thing about breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius. He pulled off the parchment, unrolled it, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to him.\n\nSend date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry turned the parchment over and looked at the back, hoping to see something else, but it was blank.\n\n\u201cWeekend after next,\u201d whispered Hermione, who had read the note over Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHere \u2014 take my quill and send this owl back straight away.\u201d\n\nHarry scribbled the dates down on the back of Sirius\u2019s letter, tied it onto the brown owl\u2019s leg, and watched it take flight again. What had he expected? Advice on how to survive underwater? He had been so intent on telling Sirius all about Snape and Moody he had completely forgotten to mention the egg\u2019s clue.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Harry dully. The momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died. \u201cCome on . . . Care of Magical Creatures.\u201d\n\nWhether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast-Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank could, Harry didn\u2019t know, but Hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he\u2019d returned to work. It turned out that Hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about monsters, though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs disappointing.\n\nToday he had managed to capture two unicorn foals. Unlike full-grown unicorns, they were pure gold. Parvati and Lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them.\n\n\u201cEasier ter spot than the adults,\u201d Hagrid told the class. \u201cThey turn silver when they\u2019re abou\u2019 two years old, an\u2019 they grow horns at aroun\u2019 four. Don\u2019 go pure white till they\u2019re full grown, \u2019round about seven. They\u2019re a bit more trustin\u2019 when they\u2019re babies . . . don\u2019 mind boys so much. . . . C\u2019mon, move in a bit, yeh can pat \u2019em if yeh want . . . give \u2019em a few o\u2019 these sugar lumps. . . .\n\n\u201cYou okay, Harry?\u201d Hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 nervous, eh?\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cBit,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder, so that Harry\u2019s knees buckled under its weight, \u201cI\u2019d\u2019ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on tha\u2019 Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin\u2019 yeh set yer mind ter. I\u2019m not worried at all. Yeh\u2019re goin\u2019 ter be fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven\u2019 yeh?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess that he didn\u2019t have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him. He looked up at Hagrid \u2014 perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it? He looked after everything else on the grounds, after all \u2014\n\n\u201cYeh\u2019re goin\u2019 ter win,\u201d Hagrid growled, patting Harry\u2019s shoulder again, so that Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground. \u201cI know it. I can feel it. Yeh\u2019re goin\u2019 ter win, Harry.\u201d\n\nHarry just couldn\u2019t bring himself to wipe the happy, confident smile off Hagrid\u2019s face. Pretending he was interested in the young unicorns, he forced a smile in return, and moved forward to pat them with the others.\n\nBy the evening before the second task, Harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare. He was fully aware that even if, by some miracle, he managed to find a suitable spell, he\u2019d have a real job mastering it overnight. How could he have let this happen? Why hadn\u2019t he got to work on the egg\u2019s clue sooner? Why had he ever let his mind wander in class \u2014 what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater?\n\nHe sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after page of spells, hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them. Harry\u2019s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word \u201cwater\u201d on a page, but more often than not it was merely \u201cTake two pints of water, half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves, and a newt . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon it can be done,\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice flatly from the other side of the table. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing. Nothing. Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere must be something,\u201d Hermione muttered, moving a candle closer to her. Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose about an inch from the page. \u201cThey\u2019d never have set a task that was undoable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they\u2019ve nicked, and see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a way of doing it!\u201d Hermione said crossly. \u201cThere just has to be!\u201d\n\nShe seemed to be taking the library\u2019s lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult; it had never failed her before.\n\n\u201cI know what I should have done,\u201d said Harry, resting, facedown, on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts. \u201cI should\u2019ve learned to be an Animagus like Sirius.\u201d\n\nAn Animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal.\n\n\u201cYeah, you could\u2019ve turned into a goldfish any time you wanted!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cOr a frog,\u201d yawned Harry. He was exhausted.\n\n\u201cIt takes years to become an Animagus, and then you have to register yourself and everything,\u201d said Hermione vaguely, now squinting down the index of Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their Solutions. \u201cProfessor McGonagall told us, remember . . . you\u2019ve got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic Office . . . what animal you become, and your markings, so you can\u2019t abuse it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, I was joking,\u201d said Harry wearily. \u201cI know I haven\u2019t got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh this is no use,\u201d Hermione said, snapping shut Weird Wizarding Dilemmas. \u201cWho on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d said Fred Weasley\u2019s voice. \u201cBe a talking point, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Fred and George had just emerged from behind some bookshelves.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you two doing here?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cLooking for you,\u201d said George. \u201cMcGonagall wants you, Ron. And you, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Hermione, looking surprised.\n\n\u201cDunno . . . she was looking a bit grim, though,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to take you down to her office,\u201d said George.\n\nRon and Hermione stared at Harry, who felt his stomach drop. Was Professor McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off? Perhaps she\u2019d noticed how much they were helping him, when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you back in the common room,\u201d Hermione told Harry as she got up to go with Ron \u2014 both of them looked very anxious. \u201cBring as many of these books as you can, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry uneasily.\n\nBy eight o\u2019clock, Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy Harry out of the library. Staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry, Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room, pulled a table into a corner, and continued to search. There was nothing in Madcap Magic for Wacky Warlocks . . . nothing in A Guide to Medieval Sorcery . . . not one mention of underwater exploits in An Anthology of Eighteenth-Century Charms, or in Dreadful Denizens of the Deep, or Powers You Never Knew You Had and What to Do with Them Now You\u2019ve Wised Up.\n\nCrookshanks crawled into Harry\u2019s lap and curled up, purring deeply. The common room emptied slowly around Harry. People kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery, confident voices like Hagrid\u2019s, all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task. Harry couldn\u2019t answer them, he just nodded, feeling as though there were a golf ball stuck in his throat. By ten to midnight, he was alone in the room with Crookshanks. He had searched all the remaining books, and Ron and Hermione had not come back.\n\nIt\u2019s over, he told himself. You can\u2019t do it. You\u2019ll just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges. . . .\n\nHe imagined himself explaining that he couldn\u2019t do the task. He pictured Bagman\u2019s look of round-eyed surprise, Karkaroff\u2019s satisfied, yellow-toothed smile. He could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying \u201cI knew it . . .\u2019e is too young, \u2019e is only a little boy.\u201d He saw Malfoy flashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the crowd, saw Hagrid\u2019s crestfallen, disbelieving face. . . .\n\nForgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap, Harry stood up very suddenly; Crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor, gave Harry a disgusted look, and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air, but Harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory. . . . He would grab the Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library, he\u2019d stay there all night if he had to. . . .\n\n\u201cLumos,\u201d Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door.\n\nWand-tip alight, he crept along the bookshelves, pulling down more books \u2014 books of hexes and charms, books on merpeople and water monsters, books on famous witches and wizards, on magical inventions, on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival. He carried them over to a table, then set to work, searching them by the narrow beam of his wand, occasionally checking his watch. . . .\n\nOne in the morning . . . two in the morning . . . the only way he could keep going was to tell himself, over and over again, next book . . . in the next one . . . the next one . . .\n\nThe mermaid in the painting in the prefects\u2019 bathroom was laughing. Harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock, while she held his Firebolt over his head.\n\n\u201cCome and get it!\u201d she giggled maliciously. \u201cCome on, jump!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Harry panted, snatching at the Firebolt, and struggling not to sink. \u201cGive it to me!\u201d\n\nBut she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick, laughing at him.\n\n\u201cThat hurts \u2014 get off \u2014 ouch \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter must wake up, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cStop poking me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby must poke Harry Potter, sir, he must wake up!\u201d\n\nHarry opened his eyes. He was still in the library; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he\u2019d slept, and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of Where There\u2019s a Wand, There\u2019s a Way. He sat up, straightening his glasses, blinking in the bright daylight.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter needs to hurry!\u201d squeaked Dobby. \u201cThe second task starts in ten minutes, and Harry Potter \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTen minutes?\u201d Harry croaked. \u201cTen \u2014 ten minutes?\u201d\n\nHe looked down at his watch. Dobby was right. It was twenty past nine. A large, dead weight seemed to fall through Harry\u2019s chest into his stomach.\n\n\u201cHurry, Harry Potter!\u201d squeaked Dobby, plucking at Harry\u2019s sleeve. \u201cYou is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late, Dobby,\u201d Harry said hopelessly. \u201cI\u2019m not doing the task, I don\u2019t know how \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter will do the task!\u201d squeaked the elf. \u201cDobby knew Harry had not found the right book, so Dobby did it for him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know what the second task is \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby knows, sir! Harry Potter has to go into the lake and find his Wheezy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFind my what?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and take his Wheezy back from the merpeople!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Wheezy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Wheezy, sir, your Wheezy \u2014 Wheezy who is giving Dobby his sweater!\u201d\n\nDobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry gasped. \u201cThey\u2019ve got . . . they\u2019ve got Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing Harry Potter will miss most, sir!\u201d squeaked Dobby. \u201c\u2018But past an hour \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 \u2018the prospect\u2019s black,\u2019\u201d Harry recited, staring, horror-struck, at the elf. \u201c\u2018Too late, it\u2019s gone, it won\u2019t come back.\u2019 Dobby \u2014 what\u2019ve I got to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou has to eat this, sir!\u201d squeaked the elf, and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy, grayish-green rat tails. \u201cRight before you go into the lake, sir \u2014 gillyweed!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it do?\u201d said Harry, staring at the gillyweed.\n\n\u201cIt will make Harry Potter breathe underwater, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby,\u201d said Harry frantically, \u201clisten \u2014 are you sure about this?\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to \u201chelp\u201d him, he had ended up with no bones in his right arm.\n\n\u201cDobby is quite sure, sir!\u201d said the elf earnestly. \u201cDobby hears things, sir, he is a house-elf, he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors. Dobby heard Professor McGonagall and Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the next task. . . . Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s doubts vanished. Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, stuffed it into his bag, grabbed the gillyweed, and put it into his pocket, then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels.\n\n\u201cDobby is supposed to be in the kitchens, sir!\u201d Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor. \u201cDobby will be missed \u2014 good luck, Harry Potter, sir, good luck!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you later, Dobby!\u201d Harry shouted, and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs, three at a time.\n\nThe entrance hall contained a few last-minute stragglers, all leaving the Great Hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task. They stared as Harry flashed past, sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright, chilly grounds.\n\nAs he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons\u2019 enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank, rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below. The excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as Harry ran flat-out around the other side of the lake toward the judges, who were sitting at another gold-draped table at the water\u2019s edge. Cedric, Fleur, and Krum were beside the judges\u2019 table, watching Harry sprint toward them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . here . . .\u201d Harry panted, skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering Fleur\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d said a bossy, disapproving voice. \u201cThe task\u2019s about to start!\u201d\n\nHarry looked around. Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges\u2019 table \u2014 Mr. Crouch had failed to turn up again.\n\n\u201cNow, now, Percy!\u201d said Ludo Bagman, who was looking intensely relieved to see Harry. \u201cLet him catch his breath!\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled at Harry, but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime didn\u2019t look at all pleased to see him. . . . It was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he wasn\u2019t going to turn up.\n\nHarry bent over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath; he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs, but there was no time to get rid of it; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions, spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet. Harry was on the very end of the line, next to Krum, who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready.\n\n\u201cAll right, Harry?\u201d Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few feet farther away from Krum. \u201cKnow what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry panted, massaging his ribs.\n\nBagman gave Harry\u2019s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges\u2019 table; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup, said, \u201cSonorus!\u201d and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands.\n\n\u201cWell, all our champions are ready for the second task, which will start on my whistle. They have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them. On the count of three, then. One . . . two . . . three!\u201d\n\nThe whistle echoed shrilly in the cold, still air; the stands erupted with cheers and applause; without looking to see what the other champions were doing, Harry pulled off his shoes and socks, pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket, stuffed it into his mouth, and waded out into the lake.\n\nIt was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire, not icy water. His sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper; now the water was over his knees, and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat, slimy stones. He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery, like octopus tentacles. Waist-deep in the freezing water he stopped, swallowed, and waited for something to happen.\n\nHe could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid, walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power. The part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples; half immersed in the icy water, a cruel breeze lifting his hair, Harry started to shiver violently. He avoided looking at the stands; the laughter was becoming louder, and there were catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins. . . .\n\nThen, quite suddenly, Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose. He tried to draw breath, but it made his head spin; his lungs were empty, and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck \u2014\n\nHarry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears, flapping in the cold air. . . . He had gills. Without pausing to think, he did the only thing that made sense \u2014 he flung himself forward into the water.\n\nThe first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life. His head had stopped spinning; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills, sending oxygen back to his brain. He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them. They looked green and ghostly under the water, and they had become webbed. He twisted around and looked at his bare feet \u2014 they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too: It looked as though he had sprouted flippers.\n\nThe water didn\u2019t feel icy anymore either . . . on the contrary, he felt pleasantly cool and very light. . . . Harry struck out once more, marveling at how far and fast his flipper-like feet propelled him through the water, and noticing how clearly he could see, and how he no longer seemed to need to blink. He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom. He flipped over and dived into its depths.\n\nSilence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape. He could only see ten feet around him, so that as he sped through the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the oncoming darkness: forests of rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains of mud littered with dull, glimmering stones. He swam deeper and deeper, out toward the middle of the lake, his eyes wide, staring through the eerily gray-lit water around him to the shadows beyond, where the water became opaque.\n\nSmall fish flickered past him like silver darts. Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him, but when he got nearer, he discovered it to be nothing but a large, blackened log, or a dense clump of weed. There was no sign of any of the other champions, merpeople, Ron \u2014 nor, thankfully, the giant squid.\n\nLight green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see, two feet deep, like a meadow of very overgrown grass. Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him, trying to discern shapes through the gloom . . . and then, without warning, something grabbed hold of his ankle.\n\nHarry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow, a small, horned water demon, poking out of the weed, its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry\u2019s leg, its pointed fangs bared \u2014 Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand. By the time he had grasped it, two more grindylows had risen out of the weed, had seized handfuls of Harry\u2019s robes, and were attempting to drag him down.\n\n\u201cRelashio!\u201d Harry shouted, except that no sound came out. . . . A large bubble issued from his mouth, and his wand, instead of sending sparks at the grindylows, pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water, for where it struck them, angry red patches appeared on their green skin. Harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylow\u2019s grip and swam, as fast as he could, occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again, and he kicked out, hard; finally, he felt his foot connect with a horned skull, and looking back, saw the dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed.\n\nHarry slowed down a little, slipped his wand back inside his robes, and looked around, listening again. He turned full circle in the water, the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums. He knew he must be even deeper in the lake now, but nothing was moving but the rippling weed.\n\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d\n\nHarry thought he was having a heart attack. He whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him, gazing at him through her thick, pearly glasses.\n\n\u201cMyrtle!\u201d Harry tried to shout \u2014 but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble. Moaning Myrtle actually giggled.\n\n\u201cYou want to try over there!\u201d she said, pointing. \u201cI won\u2019t come with you. . . . I don\u2019t like them much, they always chase me when I get too close. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry gave her the thumbs-up to show his thanks and set off once more, careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there.\n\nHe swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes. He was passing over vast expanses of black mud now, which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water. Then, at long last, he heard a snatch of haunting mersong.\n\n\u201cAn hour long you\u2019ll have to look, And to recover what we took . . .\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead. It had paintings of merpeople on it; they were carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid. Harry swam on past the rock, following the mersong.\n\n\u201c. . . your time\u2019s half gone, so tarry not Lest what you seek stays here to rot. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides. Here and there at the dark windows, Harry saw faces . . . faces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects\u2019 bathroom. . . .\n\nThe merpeople had grayish skin and long, wild, dark green hair. Their eyes were yellow, as were their broken teeth, and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks. They leered at Harry as he swam past; one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better, their powerful, silver fish tails beating the water, spears clutched in their hands.\n\nHarry sped on, staring around, and soon the dwellings became more numerous; there were gardens of weed around some of them, and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door. Merpeople were emerging on all sides now, watching him eagerly, pointing at his webbed hands and gills, talking behind their hands to one another. Harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes.\n\nA whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a mer-version of a village square. A choir of merpeople was singing in the middle, calling the champions toward them, and behind them rose a crude sort of statue; a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder. Four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson.\n\nRon was tied between Hermione and Cho Chang. There was also a girl who looked no older than eight, whose clouds of silvery hair made Harry feel sure that she was Fleur Delacour\u2019s sister. All four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep. Their heads were lolling onto their shoulders, and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths.\n\nHarry sped toward the hostages, half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him, but they did nothing. The ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick, slimy, and very strong. For a fleeting second he thought of the knife Sirius had bought him for Christmas \u2014 locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away, no use to him whatsoever.\n\nHe looked around. Many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears. He swam swiftly toward a seven-foot-tall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear. The merman laughed and shook his head.\n\n\u201cWe do not help,\u201d he said in a harsh, croaky voice.\n\n\u201cCome ON!\u201d Harry said fiercely (but only bubbles issued from his mouth), and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman, but the merman yanked it back, still shaking his head and laughing.\n\nHarry swirled around, staring about. Something sharp . . . anything . . .\n\nThere were rocks littering the lake bottom. He dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue. He began to hack at the ropes binding Ron, and after several minutes\u2019 hard work, they broke apart. Ron floated, unconscious, a few inches above the lake bottom, drifting a little in the ebb of the water.\n\nHarry looked around. There was no sign of any of the other champions. What were they playing at? Why didn\u2019t they hurry up? He turned back to Hermione, raised the jagged rock, and began to hack at her bindings too \u2014\n\nAt once, several pairs of strong gray hands seized him. Half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from Hermione, shaking their green-haired heads, and laughing.\n\n\u201cYou take your own hostage,\u201d one of them said to him. \u201cLeave the others . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way!\u201d said Harry furiously \u2014 but only two large bubbles came out.\n\n\u201cYour task is to retrieve your own friend . . . leave the others . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s my friend too!\u201d Harry yelled, gesturing toward Hermione, an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to die either!\u201d\n\nCho\u2019s head was on Hermione\u2019s shoulder; the small silver-haired girl was ghostly green and pale. Harry struggled to fight off the mermen, but they laughed harder than ever, holding him back. Harry looked wildly around. Where were the other champions? Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and come back down for Hermione and the others? Would he be able to find them again? He looked down at his watch to see how much time was left \u2014 it had stopped working.\n\nBut then the merpeople around him started pointing excitedly over his head. Harry looked up and saw Cedric swimming toward them. There was an enormous bubble around his head, which made his features look oddly wide and stretched.\n\n\u201cGot lost!\u201d he mouthed, looking panic-stricken. \u201cFleur and Krum\u2019re coming now!\u201d\n\nFeeling enormously relieved, Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free. He pulled her upward and out of sight.\n\nHarry looked around, waiting. Where were Fleur and Krum? Time was getting short, and according to the song, the hostages would be lost after an hour. . . .\n\nThe merpeople started screeching animatedly. Those holding Harry loosened their grip, staring behind them. Harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them: a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark. . . . It was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured himself \u2014 but badly.\n\nThe shark-man swam straight to Hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes; the trouble was that Krum\u2019s new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry was quite sure that if Krum wasn\u2019t careful, he was going to rip Hermione in half. Darting forward, Harry hit Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone. Krum seized it and began to cut Hermione free. Within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface.\n\nNow what? Harry thought desperately. If he could be sure that Fleur was coming. . . . But still no sign. There was nothing to be done except . . .\n\nHe snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, but the mermen now closed in around Ron and the little girl, shaking their heads at him. Harry pulled out his wand.\n\n\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d\n\nOnly bubbles flew out of his mouth, but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him, because they suddenly stopped laughing. Their yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry\u2019s wand, and they looked scared. There might be a lot more of them than there were of him, but Harry could tell, by the looks on their faces, that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got until three!\u201d Harry shouted; a great stream of bubbles burst from him, but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message. \u201cOne . . .\u201d (he put down a finger) \u201ctwo . . .\u201d (he put down a second one) \u2014\n\nThey scattered. Harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue, and at last she was free. He seized the little girl around the waist, grabbed the neck of Ron\u2019s robes, and kicked off from the bottom.\n\nIt was very slow work. He could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself forward; he worked his flippers furiously, but Ron and Fleur\u2019s sister were like potato-filled sacks dragging him back down. . . . He fixed his eyes skyward, though he knew he must still be very deep, the water above him was so dark. . . .\n\nMerpeople were rising with him. He could see them swirling around him with ease, watching him struggle through the water. . . . Would they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up? Did they perhaps eat humans? Harry\u2019s legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and the girl. . . .\n\nHe was drawing breath with extreme difficulty. He could feel pain on the sides of his neck again . . . he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouth . . . yet the darkness was definitely thinning now . . . he could see daylight above him. . . .\n\nHe kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feet . . . water was flooding through his mouth into his lungs . . . he was starting to feel dizzy, but he knew light and air were only ten feet above him . . . he had to get there . . . he had to . . .\n\nHarry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest; his very brain felt waterlogged, he couldn\u2019t breathe, he needed oxygen, he had to keep going, he could not stop \u2014\n\nAnd then he felt his head break the surface of the lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he had never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled Ron and the little girl up with him. All around him, wild, green-haired heads were emerging out of the water with him, but they were smiling at him.\n\nThe crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise; shouting and screaming, they all seemed to be on their feet; Harry had the impression they thought that Ron and the little girl might be dead, but they were wrong . . . both of them had opened their eyes; the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright light, turned to Harry, and said, \u201cWet, this, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Then he spotted Fleur\u2019s sister. \u201cWhat did you bring her for?\u201d\n\n\u201cFleur didn\u2019t turn up, I couldn\u2019t leave her,\u201d Harry panted.\n\n\u201cHarry, you prat,\u201d said Ron, \u201cyou didn\u2019t take that song thing seriously, did you? Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t have let any of us drown!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe song said \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit!\u201d said Ron. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t waste time down there acting the hero!\u201d\n\nHarry felt both stupid and annoyed. It was all very well for Ron; he\u2019d been asleep, he hadn\u2019t felt how eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear-carrying merpeople who\u2019d looked more than capable of murder.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Harry said shortly, \u201chelp me with her, I don\u2019t think she can swim very well.\u201d\n\nThey pulled Fleur\u2019s sister through the water, back toward the bank where the judges stood watching, twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor, singing their horrible screechy songs.\n\nHarry could see Madam Pomfrey fussing over Hermione, Krum, Cedric, and Cho, all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets. Dumbledore and Ludo Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the bank as they swam nearer, but Percy, who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual, came splashing out to meet them. Meanwhile Madame Maxime was trying to restrain Fleur Delacour, who was quite hysterical, fighting tooth and nail to return to the water.\n\n\u201cGabrielle! Gabrielle! Is she alive? Is she \u2019urt?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine!\u201d Harry tried to tell her, but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk, let alone shout.\n\nPercy seized Ron and was dragging him back to the bank (\u201cGerroff, Percy, I\u2019m all right!\u201d); Dumbledore and Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.\n\n\u201cIt was ze grindylows . . . zey attacked me . . . oh Gabrielle, I thought . . . I thought . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome here, you,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey. She seized Harry and pulled him over to Hermione and the others, wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket, and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat. Steam gushed out of his ears.\n\n\u201cHarry, well done!\u201d Hermione cried. \u201cYou did it, you found out how all by yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014\u201d said Harry. He would have told her about Dobby, but he had just noticed Karkaroff watching him. He was the only judge who had not left the table; the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur\u2019s sister had got back safely. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Harry, raising his voice slightly so that Karkaroff could hear him.\n\n\u201cYou haff a water beetle in your hair, Herm-own-ninny,\u201d said Krum. Harry had the impression that Krum was drawing her attention back onto himself; perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake, but Hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said, \u201cYou\u2019re well outside the time limit, though, Harry. . . . Did it take you ages to find us?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo . . . I found you okay. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s feeling of stupidity was growing. Now he was out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that Dumbledore\u2019s safety precautions wouldn\u2019t have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadn\u2019t turned up. Why hadn\u2019t he just grabbed Ron and gone? He would have been first back. . . . Cedric and Krum hadn\u2019t wasted time worrying about anyone else; they hadn\u2019t taken the mersong seriously. . . .\n\nDumbledore was crouching at the water\u2019s edge, deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson, a particularly wild and ferocious-looking female. He was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak Mermish. Finally he straightened up, turned to his fellow judges, and said, \u201cA conference before we give the marks, I think.\u201d\n\nThe judges went into a huddle. Madam Pomfrey had gone to rescue Ron from Percy\u2019s clutches; she led him over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and her sister. Fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn, but she didn\u2019t seem to care, nor would she allow Madam Pomfrey to clean them.\n\n\u201cLook after Gabrielle,\u201d she told her, and then she turned to Harry. \u201cYou saved \u2019er,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cEven though she was not your \u2019ostage.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, who was now heartily wishing he\u2019d left all three girls tied to the statue.\n\nFleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek (he felt his face burn and wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), then said to Ron, \u201cAnd you too \u2014 you \u2019elped \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, \u201cyeah, a bit \u2014\u201d\n\nFleur swooped down on him too and kissed him. Hermione looked simply furious, but just then, Ludo Bagman\u2019s magically magnified voice boomed out beside them, making them all jump, and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have reached our decision. Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake, and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions, as follows. . . .\n\n\u201cFleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble-Head Charm, was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal, and failed to retrieve her hostage. We award her twenty-five points.\u201d\n\nApplause from the stands.\n\n\u201cI deserved zero,\u201d said Fleur throatily, shaking her magnificent head.\n\n\u201cCedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm, was first to return with his hostage, though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour.\u201d Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look. \u201cWe therefore award him forty-seven points.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart sank. If Cedric had been outside the time limit, he most certainly had been.\n\n\u201cViktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration, which was nevertheless effective, and was second to return with his hostage. We award him forty points.\u201d\n\nKarkaroff clapped particularly hard, looking very superior.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter used gillyweed to great effect,\u201d Bagman continued. \u201cHe returned last, and well outside the time limit of an hour. However, the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety, not merely his own.\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione both gave Harry half-exasperated, half-commiserating looks.\n\n\u201cMost of the judges,\u201d and here, Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look, \u201cfeel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks. However . . . Mr. Potter\u2019s score is forty-five points.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach leapt \u2014 he was now tying for first place with Cedric. Ron and Hermione, caught by surprise, stared at Harry, then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.\n\n\u201cThere you go, Harry!\u201d Ron shouted over the noise. \u201cYou weren\u2019t being thick after all \u2014 you were showing moral fiber!\u201d\n\nFleur was clapping very hard too, but Krum didn\u2019t look happy at all. He attempted to engage Hermione in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering Harry to listen.\n\n\u201cThe third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of June,\u201d continued Bagman. \u201cThe champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand. Thank you all for your support of the champions.\u201d\n\nIt was over, Harry thought dazedly, as Madam Pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes . . . it was over, he had got through . . . he didn\u2019t have to worry about anything now until June the twenty-fourth. . . .\n\nNext time he was in Hogsmeade, Harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle, he was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter27": "PADFOOT RETURNS\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that Ron was getting to share Harry\u2019s limelight for once. Harry noticed that Ron\u2019s version of events changed subtly with every retelling. At first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with Hermione\u2019s story, anyway \u2014 Dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor McGonagall\u2019s office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. One week later, however, Ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up.\n\n\u201cBut I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,\u201d he assured Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors. \u201cI could\u2019ve taken those mer-idiots any time I wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat were you going to do, snore at them?\u201d said Hermione waspishly. People had been teasing her so much about being the thing that Viktor Krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.\n\nRon\u2019s ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events.\n\nAs they entered March the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds. There were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course. The brown owl that Harry had sent to Sirius with the dates of the Hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on Friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; Harry had no sooner torn off Sirius\u2019s reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again.\n\nSirius\u2019s letter was almost as short as the previous one.\n\nBe at stile at end of road out of Hogsmeade (past Dervish and Banges) at two o\u2019clock on Saturday afternoon. Bring as much food as you can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t come back to Hogsmeade?\u201d said Ron incredulously.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe him,\u201d said Harry tensely, \u201cif he\u2019s caught . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMade it so far, though, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d said Ron. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore.\u201d\n\nHarry folded up the letter, thinking. If he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see Sirius again. He therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon \u2014 double Potions \u2014 feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons.\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson\u2019s gang of Slytherin girls. All of them were looking at something Harry couldn\u2019t see and sniggering heartily. Pansy\u2019s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle\u2019s broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached.\n\n\u201cThere they are, there they are!\u201d she giggled, and the knot of Slytherins broke apart. Harry saw that Pansy had a magazine in her hands \u2014 Witch Weekly. The moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.\n\n\u201cYou might find something to interest you in there, Granger!\u201d Pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at Hermione, who caught it, looking startled. At that moment, the dungeon door opened, and Snape beckoned them all inside.\n\nHermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual. Once Snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of today\u2019s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk. At last, in the center pages, Hermione found what they were looking for. Harry and Ron leaned in closer. A color photograph of Harry headed a short piece entitled:\n\nHarry Potter\u2019s Secret Heartache\n\nA boy like no other, perhaps \u2014 yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes Rita Skeeter. Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteen-year-old Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle-born Hermione Granger. Little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss.\n\nMiss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone cannot satisfy. Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with both boys\u2019 affections. Krum, who is openly smitten with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has \u201cnever felt this way about any other girl.\u201d\n\nHowever, it might not be Miss Granger\u2019s doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys\u2019 interest.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really ugly,\u201d says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth-year student, \u201cbut she\u2019d be well up to making a Love Potion, she\u2019s quite brainy. I think that\u2019s how she\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\nLove Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. In the meantime, Harry Potter\u2019s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI told you!\u201d Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared down at the article. \u201cI told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter! She\u2019s made you out to be some sort of \u2014 of scarlet woman!\u201d\n\nHermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. \u201cScarlet woman?\u201d she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at Ron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what my mum calls them,\u201d Ron muttered, his ears going red.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the best Rita can do, she\u2019s losing her touch,\u201d said Hermione, still giggling, as she threw Witch Weekly onto the empty chair beside her. \u201cWhat a pile of old rubbish.\u201d\n\nShe looked over at the Slytherins, who were all watching her and Harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. Hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something funny, though,\u201d said Hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles. \u201cHow could Rita Skeeter have known . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnown what?\u201d said Ron quickly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been mixing up Love Potions, have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just . . . how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?\u201d\n\nHermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.\n\n\u201cHe asked me right after he\u2019d pulled me out of the lake,\u201d Hermione muttered. \u201cAfter he\u2019d got rid of his shark\u2019s head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn\u2019t hear, and he said, if I wasn\u2019t doing anything over the summer, would I like to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione.\n\n\u201cAnd he did say he\u2019d never felt the same way about anyone else,\u201d Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, \u201cbut how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn\u2019t there . . . or was she? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk.\n\n\u201cWell, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFascinating though your social life undoubtedly is, Miss Granger,\u201d said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, \u201cI must ask you not to discuss it in my class. Ten points from Gryffindor.\u201d\n\nSnape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. The whole class was now looking around at them; Malfoy took the opportunity to flash POTTER STINKS across the dungeon at Harry.\n\n\u201cAh . . . reading magazines under the table as well?\u201d Snape added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly. \u201cA further ten points from Gryffindor . . . oh but of course . . .\u201d Snape\u2019s black eyes glittered as they fell on Rita Skeeter\u2019s article. \u201cPotter has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . .\u201d\n\nThe dungeon rang with the Slytherins\u2019 laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled Snape\u2019s thin mouth. To Harry\u2019s fury, he began to read the article aloud.\n\n\u201c\u2018Harry Potter\u2019s Secret Heartache\u2019 . . . dear, dear, Potter, what\u2019s ailing you now? \u2018A boy like no other, perhaps . . .\u2019\u201d\n\nHarry could feel his face burning. Snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a hearty laugh. The article sounded ten times worse when read by Snape. Even Hermione was blushing scarlet now.\n\n\u201c\u2018 . . . Harry Potter\u2019s well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate.\u2019 How very touching,\u201d sneered Snape, rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the Slytherins. \u201cWell, I think I had better separate the three of you, so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives. Weasley, you stay here. Miss Granger, over there, beside Miss Parkinson. Potter \u2014 that table in front of my desk. Move. Now.\u201d\n\nFurious, Harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table. Snape followed, sat down at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron. Determined not to look at Snape, Harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to have Snape\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAll this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head, Potter,\u201d said Snape quietly, once the rest of the class had settled down again.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t answer. He knew Snape was trying to provoke him; he had done this before. No doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from Gryffindor before the end of the class.\n\n\u201cYou might be laboring under the delusion that the entire Wizarding world is impressed with you,\u201d Snape went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him (Harry continued to pound his scarab beetles, even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder), \u201cbut I don\u2019t care how many times your picture appears in the papers. To me, Potter, you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him.\u201d\n\nHarry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots. His hands were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his eyes down, as though he couldn\u2019t hear what Snape was saying to him.\n\n\u201cSo I give you fair warning, Potter,\u201d Snape continued in a softer and more dangerous voice, \u201cpint-sized celebrity or not \u2014 if I catch you breaking into my office one more time \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been anywhere near your office!\u201d said Harry angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Snape hissed, his fathomless black eyes boring into Harry\u2019s. \u201cBoomslang skin. Gillyweed. Both come from my private stores, and I know who stole them.\u201d\n\nHarry stared back at Snape, determined not to blink or to look guilty. In truth, he hadn\u2019t stolen either of these things from Snape. Hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year \u2014 they had needed it for the Polyjuice Potion \u2014 and while Snape had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been able to prove it. Dobby, of course, had stolen the gillyweed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Harry lied coldly.\n\n\u201cYou were out of bed on the night my office was broken into!\u201d Snape hissed. \u201cI know it, Potter! Now, Mad-Eye Moody might have joined your fan club, but I will not tolerate your behavior! One more nighttime stroll into my office, Potter, and you will pay!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry coolly, turning back to his ginger roots. \u201cI\u2019ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there.\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s eyes flashed. He plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes. For one wild moment, Harry thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him \u2014 then he saw that Snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion. Harry stared at it.\n\n\u201cDo you know what this is, Potter?\u201d Snape said, his eyes glittering dangerously again.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, with complete honesty this time.\n\n\u201cIt is Veritaserum \u2014 a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear,\u201d said Snape viciously. \u201cNow, the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines. But unless you watch your step, you might just find that my hand slips\u201d \u2014 he shook the crystal bottle slightly \u2014 \u201cright over your evening pumpkin juice. And then, Potter . . . then we\u2019ll find out whether you\u2019ve been in my office or not.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing. He turned back to his ginger roots once more, picked up his knife, and started slicing them again. He didn\u2019t like the sound of that Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to slip him some. He repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape did it . . . quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble \u2014 Hermione and Dobby for a start \u2014 there were all the other things he was concealing . . . like the fact that he was in contact with Sirius . . . and \u2014 his insides squirmed at the thought \u2014 how he felt about Cho. . . . He tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too, and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of Moody\u2019s book and start drinking only from a private hip flask.\n\nThere was a knock on the dungeon door.\n\n\u201cEnter,\u201d said Snape in his usual voice.\n\nThe class looked around as the door opened. Professor Karkaroff came in. Everyone watched him as he walked up toward Snape\u2019s desk. He was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d said Karkaroff abruptly when he had reached Snape. He seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips; it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist. Harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots, listening hard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,\u201d Snape muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him.\n\n\u201cI want to talk now, while you can\u2019t slip off, Severus. You\u2019ve been avoiding me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the lesson,\u201d Snape snapped.\n\nUnder the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if he\u2019d poured out enough armadillo bile, Harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them. Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked angry.\n\nKarkaroff hovered behind Snape\u2019s desk for the rest of the double period. He seemed intent on preventing Snape from slipping away at the end of class. Keen to hear what Karkaroff wanted to say, Harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell, which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so urgent?\u201d he heard Snape hiss at Karkaroff.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Karkaroff, and Harry, peering around the edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left-hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on his inner forearm.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Karkaroff, still making every effort not to move his lips. \u201cDo you see? It\u2019s never been this clear, never since \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPut it away!\u201d snarled Snape, his black eyes sweeping the classroom.\n\n\u201cBut you must have noticed \u2014\u201d Karkaroff began in an agitated voice.\n\n\u201cWe can talk later, Karkaroff!\u201d spat Snape. \u201cPotter! What are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cClearing up my armadillo bile, Professor,\u201d said Harry innocently, straightening up and showing Snape the sodden rag he was holding.\n\nKarkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon. He looked both worried and angry. Not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry Snape, Harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just witnessed.\n\nThey left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds. The weather was milder than it had been all year, and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade, all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders. The food Sirius had told them to bring was in Harry\u2019s bag; they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs, a loaf of bread, and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table.\n\nThey went into Gladrags Wizardwear to buy a present for Dobby, where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find, including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars, and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly. Then, at half past one, they made their way up the High Street, past Dervish and Banges, and out toward the edge of the village.\n\nHarry had never been in this direction before. The winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around Hogsmeade. The cottages were fewer here, and their gardens larger; they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow Hogsmeade lay. Then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane. Waiting for them, its front paws on the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar. . . .\n\n\u201cHello, Sirius,\u201d said Harry when they had reached him.\n\nThe black dog sniffed Harry\u2019s bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain. Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed over the stile and followed.\n\nSirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, with his four paws, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out of breath. They followed Sirius higher, up onto the mountain itself. For nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony path, following Sirius\u2019s wagging tail, sweating in the sun, the shoulder straps of Harry\u2019s bag cutting into his shoulders.\n\nThen, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached the place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the rock. They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly lit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large rock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant eagle, Buckbeak\u2019s fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them. All three of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperiously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just turned into his godfather.\n\nSirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the same ones he had been wearing when he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and matted once more. He looked very thin.\n\n\u201cChicken!\u201d he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor.\n\nHarry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Sirius, opening it, grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ve been living off rats mostly. Can\u2019t steal too much food from Hogsmeade; I\u2019d draw attention to myself.\u201d\n\nHe grinned up at Harry, but Harry returned the grin only reluctantly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here, Sirius?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFulfilling my duty as godfather,\u201d said Sirius, gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019m pretending to be a lovable stray.\u201d\n\nHe was still grinning, but seeing the anxiety in Harry\u2019s face, said more seriously, \u201cI want to be on the spot. Your last letter . . . well, let\u2019s just say things are getting fishier. I\u2019ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out, and by the looks of things, I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s getting worried.\u201d\n\nHe nodded at the yellowing Daily Prophets on the cave floor, and Ron picked them up and unfolded them. Harry, however, continued to stare at Sirius.\n\n\u201cWhat if they catch you? What if you\u2019re seen?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I\u2019m an Animagus,\u201d said Sirius, shrugging, and continuing to devour the chicken leg.\n\nRon nudged Harry and passed him the Daily Prophets. There were two: The first bore the headline Mystery Illness of Bartemius Crouch, the second, Ministry Witch Still Missing \u2014 Minister of Magic Now Personally Involved.\n\nHarry scanned the story about Crouch. Phrases jumped out at him: hasn\u2019t been seen in public since November . . . house appears deserted . . . St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries decline comment . . . Ministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness. . . .\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making it sound like he\u2019s dying,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cBut he can\u2019t be that ill if he managed to get up here. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brother\u2019s Crouch\u2019s personal assistant,\u201d Ron informed Sirius. \u201cHe says Crouch is suffering from overwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cMind you, he did look ill, last time I saw him up close,\u201d said Harry slowly, still reading the story. \u201cThe night my name came out of the goblet. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting his comeuppance for sacking Winky, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Hermione, an edge to her voice. She was stroking Buckbeak, who was crunching up Sirius\u2019s chicken bones. \u201cI bet he wishes he hadn\u2019t done it now \u2014 bet he feels the difference now she\u2019s not there to look after him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione\u2019s obsessed with house-elves,\u201d Ron muttered to Sirius, casting Hermione a dark look. Sirius, however, looked interested.\n\n\u201cCrouch sacked his house-elf?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, at the Quidditch World Cup,\u201d said Harry, and he launched into the story of the Dark Mark\u2019s appearance, and Winky being found with Harry\u2019s wand clutched in her hand, and Mr. Crouch\u2019s fury. When Harry had finished, Sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave.\n\n\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d he said after a while, brandishing a fresh chicken leg. \u201cYou first saw the elf in the Top Box. She was saving Crouch a seat, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.\n\n\u201cBut Crouch didn\u2019t turn up for the match?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI think he said he\u2019d been too busy.\u201d\n\nSirius paced all around the cave in silence. Then he said, \u201cHarry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you\u2019d left the Top Box?\u201d\n\n\u201cErm . . .\u201d Harry thought hard. \u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to use it before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars.\u201d He stared at Sirius. \u201cAre you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cWinky didn\u2019t steal that wand!\u201d Hermione insisted.\n\n\u201cThe elf wasn\u2019t the only one in that box,\u201d said Sirius, his brow furrowed as he continued to pace. \u201cWho else was sitting behind you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLoads of people,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSome Bulgarian ministers . . . Cornelius Fudge . . . the Malfoys . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Malfoys!\u201d said Ron suddenly, so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave, and Buckbeak tossed his head nervously. \u201cI bet it was Lucius Malfoy!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone else?\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cNo one,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, there was, there was Ludo Bagman,\u201d Hermione reminded him.\n\n\u201cOh yeah . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps,\u201d said Sirius, still pacing. \u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he, now?\u201d said Sirius, frowning more deeply. \u201cI wonder why he\u2019d do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSays he\u2019s taken a liking to me,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Sirius, looking thoughtful.\n\n\u201cWe saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared,\u201d Hermione told Sirius. \u201cRemember?\u201d she said to Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cYeah, but he didn\u2019t stay in the forest, did he?\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know?\u201d Hermione shot back. \u201cHow d\u2019you know where he Disapparated to?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome off it,\u201d said Ron incredulously. \u201cAre you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more likely he did it than Winky,\u201d said Hermione stubbornly.\n\n\u201cTold you,\u201d said Ron, looking meaningfully at Sirius, \u201ctold you she\u2019s obsessed with house \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Sirius held up a hand to silence Ron.\n\n\u201cWhen the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry\u2019s wand, what did Crouch do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWent to look in the bushes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut there wasn\u2019t anyone else there.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sirius muttered, pacing up and down, \u201cof course, he\u2019d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf . . . and then he sacked her?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione in a heated voice, \u201che sacked her, just because she hadn\u2019t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!\u201d said Ron.\n\nSirius shook his head and said, \u201cShe\u2019s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man\u2019s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.\u201d\n\nHe ran a hand over his unshaven face, evidently thinking hard.\n\n\u201cAll these absences of Barty Crouch\u2019s . . . he goes to the trouble of making sure his house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn\u2019t bother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that too. . . . It\u2019s not like Crouch. If he\u2019s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I\u2019ll eat Buckbeak.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you know Crouch, then?\u201d said Harry.\n\nSirius\u2019s face darkened. He suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when Harry first met him, the night when Harry still believed Sirius to be a murderer.\n\n\u201cOh I know Crouch all right,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban \u2014 without a trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron and Hermione together.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Sirius, taking another great bite of chicken. \u201cCrouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione shook their heads.\n\n\u201cHe was tipped for the next Minister of Magic,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cHe\u2019s a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical \u2014 and power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter,\u201d he said, reading the look on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cNo, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn\u2019t understand . . . you\u2019re too young. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what my dad said at the World Cup,\u201d said Ron, with a trace of irritation in his voice. \u201cTry us, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nA grin flashed across Sirius\u2019s thin face.\n\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll try you. . . .\u201d He walked once up the cave, back again, and then said, \u201cImagine that Voldemort\u2019s powerful now. You don\u2019t know who his supporters are, you don\u2019t know who\u2019s working for him and who isn\u2019t; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves. You\u2019re scared for yourself, and your family, and your friends. Every week, news comes of more deaths, more disappearances, more torturing . . . the Ministry of Magic\u2019s in disarray, they don\u2019t know what to do, they\u2019re trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles, but meanwhile, Muggles are dying too. Terror everywhere . . . panic . . . confusion . . . that\u2019s how it used to be.\n\n\u201cWell, times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. Crouch\u2019s principles might\u2019ve been good in the beginning \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t know. He rose quickly through the Ministry, and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort\u2019s supporters. The Aurors were given new powers \u2014 powers to kill rather than capture, for instance. And I wasn\u2019t the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial. Crouch fought violence with violence, and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects. I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side. He had his supporters, mind you \u2014 plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way, and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic. When Voldemort disappeared, it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job. But then something rather unfortunate happened. . . .\u201d Sirius smiled grimly. \u201cCrouch\u2019s own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who\u2019d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban. Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrouch\u2019s son was caught?\u201d gasped Hermione.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Sirius, throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak, flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread, and tearing it in half. \u201cNasty little shock for old Barty, I\u2019d imagine. Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family, shouldn\u2019t he? Ought to have left the office early once in a while . . . gotten to know his own son.\u201d\n\nHe began to wolf down large pieces of bread.\n\n\u201cWas his son a Death Eater?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Sirius, still stuffing down bread. \u201cI was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in. This is mostly stuff I\u2019ve found out since I got out. The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I\u2019d bet my life were Death Eaters \u2014 but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, just like the house-elf.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Crouch try and get his son off?\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\nSirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark.\n\n\u201cCrouch let his son off? I thought you had the measure of him, Hermione! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic. You saw him dismiss a devoted house-elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again \u2014 doesn\u2019t that tell you what he\u2019s like? Crouch\u2019s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial, and by all accounts, it wasn\u2019t much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy . . . then he sent him straight to Azkaban.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gave his own son to the dementors?\u201d asked Harry quietly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Sirius, and he didn\u2019t look remotely amused now. \u201cI saw the dementors bringing him in, watched them through the bars in my cell door. He can\u2019t have been more than nineteen. They took him into a cell near mine. He was screaming for his mother by nightfall. He went quiet after a few days, though . . . they all went quiet in the end . . . except when they shrieked in their sleep. . . .\u201d\n\nFor a moment, the deadened look in Sirius\u2019s eyes became more pronounced than ever, as though shutters had closed behind them.\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s still in Azkaban?\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Sirius dully. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not in there anymore. He died about a year after they brought him in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one,\u201d said Sirius bitterly. \u201cMost go mad in there, and plenty stop eating in the end. They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the dementors could sense it, they got excited. That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived. Crouch being an important Ministry member, he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit. That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch, half carrying his wife past my cell. She died herself, apparently, shortly afterward. Grief. Wasted away just like the boy. Crouch never came for his son\u2019s body. The dementors buried him outside the fortress; I watched them do it.\u201d\n\nSirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it.\n\n\u201cSo old Crouch lost it all, just when he thought he had it made,\u201d he continued, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cOne moment, a hero, poised to become Minister of Magic . . . next, his son dead, his wife dead, the family name dishonored, and, so I\u2019ve heard since I escaped, a big drop in popularity. Once the boy had died, people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray. The conclusion was that his father never cared much for him. So Cornelius Fudge got the top job, and Crouch was shunted sideways into the Department of International Magical Cooperation.\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence. Harry was thinking of the way Crouch\u2019s eyes had bulged as he\u2019d looked down at his disobedient house-elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup. This, then, must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark. It had brought back memories of his son, and the old scandal, and his fall from grace at the Ministry.\n\n\u201cMoody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards,\u201d Harry told Sirius.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s become a bit of a mania with him,\u201d said Sirius, nodding. \u201cIf you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he sneaked up here to search Snape\u2019s office!\u201d said Ron triumphantly, looking at Hermione.\n\n\u201cYes, and that doesn\u2019t make sense at all,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cYeah, it does!\u201d said Ron excitedly, but Sirius shook his head.\n\n\u201cListen, if Crouch wants to investigate Snape, why hasn\u2019t he been coming to judge the tournament? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you think Snape could be up to something, then?\u201d asked Harry, but Hermione broke in.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh give it a rest, Hermione,\u201d said Ron impatiently. \u201cI know Dumbledore\u2019s brilliant and everything, but that doesn\u2019t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn\u2019t fool him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did Snape save Harry\u2019s life in the first year, then? Why didn\u2019t he just let him die?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno \u2014 maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think, Sirius?\u201d Harry said loudly, and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve both got a point,\u201d said Sirius, looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione. \u201cEver since I found out Snape was teaching here, I\u2019ve wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape\u2019s always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was,\u201d Sirius added, and Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \u201cSnape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters.\u201d\n\nSirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names.\n\n\u201cRosier and Wilkes \u2014 they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell. The Lestranges \u2014 they\u2019re a married couple \u2014 they\u2019re in Azkaban. Avery \u2014 from what I\u2019ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he\u2019d been acting under the Imperius Curse \u2014 he\u2019s still at large. But as far as I know, Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater \u2014 not that that means much. Plenty of them were never caught. And Snape\u2019s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYeah, you should\u2019ve seen Snape\u2019s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cKarkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape\u2019s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn\u2019t see what it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe showed Snape something on his arm?\u201d said Sirius, looking frankly bewildered. He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair, then shrugged again. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve no idea what that\u2019s about . . . but if Karkaroff\u2019s genuinely worried, and he\u2019s going to Snape for answers . . .\u201d\n\nSirius stared at the cave wall, then made a grimace of frustration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn\u2019t, but I just can\u2019t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he\u2019d ever worked for Voldemort.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape\u2019s office then?\u201d said Ron stubbornly.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Sirius slowly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every single teacher\u2019s office when he got to Hogwarts. He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously, Moody. I\u2019m not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he\u2019s seen, it\u2019s not surprising. I\u2019ll say this for Moody, though, he never killed if he could help it. Always brought people in alive where possible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he\u2019s a different matter . . . is he really ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape\u2019s office? And if he\u2019s not . . . what\u2019s he up to? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he didn\u2019t turn up in the Top Box? What\u2019s he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament?\u201d\n\nSirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked. Finally, Sirius looked up at Ron.\n\n\u201cYou say your brother\u2019s Crouch\u2019s personal assistant? Any chance you could ask him if he\u2019s seen Crouch lately?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can try,\u201d said Ron doubtfully. \u201cBetter not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy, though. Percy loves Crouch.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you might try and find out whether they\u2019ve got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you\u2019re at it,\u201d said Sirius, gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet.\n\n\u201cBagman told me they hadn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s quoted in the article in there,\u201d said Sirius, nodding at the paper. \u201cBlustering on about how bad Bertha\u2019s memory is. Well, maybe she\u2019s changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn\u2019t forgetful at all \u2014 quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trouble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that\u2019s why Bagman didn\u2019t bother to look for her for so long. . . .\u201d\n\nSirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the time?\u201d\n\nHarry checked his watch, then remembered it hadn\u2019t been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s half past three,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get back to school,\u201d Sirius said, getting to his feet. \u201cNow listen . . .\u201d He looked particularly hard at Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you\u2019re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows,\u201d Harry said, but Sirius scowled at him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care . . . I\u2019ll breathe freely again when this tournament\u2019s over, and that\u2019s not until June. And don\u2019t forget, if you\u2019re talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?\u201d\n\nHe handed Harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat Buckbeak good-bye. \u201cI\u2019ll walk to the edge of the village with you,\u201d said Sirius, \u201csee if I can scrounge another paper.\u201d\n\nHe transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave, and they walked back down the mountainside with him, across the boulder-strewn ground, and back to the stile. Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head, before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village. Harry, Ron, and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cWonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch?\u201d Ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle. \u201cBut maybe he doesn\u2019t care . . . it\u2019d probably just make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He\u2019d just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.\u201d\n\n\u201cPercy would never throw any of his family to the dementors,\u201d said Hermione severely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf he thought we were standing in the way of his career . . . Percy\u2019s really ambitious, you know. . . .\u201d\n\nThey walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall, where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the Great Hall.\n\n\u201cPoor old Snuffles,\u201d said Ron, breathing deeply. \u201cHe must really like you, Harry. . . . Imagine having to live off rats.\u201d"}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter28": "THE MADNESS OF MR. CROUCH\n\n\n\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery after breakfast on Sunday to send a letter to Percy, asking, as Sirius had suggested, whether he had seen Mr. Crouch lately. They used Hedwig, because it had been so long since she\u2019d had a job. When they had watched her fly out of sight through the Owlery window, they proceeded down to the kitchen to give Dobby his new socks.\n\nThe house-elves gave them a very cheery welcome, bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again. Dobby was ecstatic about his present.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter is too good to Dobby!\u201d he squeaked, wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes.\n\n\u201cYou saved my life with that gillyweed, Dobby, you really did,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo chance of more of those eclairs, is there?\u201d said Ron, who was looking around at the beaming and bowing house-elves.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just had breakfast!\u201d said Hermione irritably, but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them, supported by four elves.\n\n\u201cWe should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles,\u201d Harry muttered.\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said Ron. \u201cGive Pig something to do. You couldn\u2019t give us a bit of extra food, could you?\u201d he said to the surrounding elves, and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more.\n\n\u201cDobby, where\u2019s Winky?\u201d said Hermione, who was looking around.\n\n\u201cWinky is over there by the fire, miss,\u201d said Dobby quietly, his ears drooping slightly.\n\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d said Hermione as she spotted Winky.\n\nHarry looked over at the fireplace too. Winky was sitting on the same stool as last time, but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smoke-blackened brick behind her. Her clothes were ragged and unwashed. She was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool, staring into the fire. As they watched her, she gave an enormous hiccup.\n\n\u201cWinky is getting through six bottles a day now,\u201d Dobby whispered to Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not strong, that stuff,\u201d Harry said.\n\nBut Dobby shook his head. \u201c\u2019Tis strong for a house-elf, sir,\u201d he said.\n\nWinky hiccuped again. The elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work.\n\n\u201cWinky is pining, Harry Potter,\u201d Dobby whispered sadly. \u201cWinky wants to go home. Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master, sir, and nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, Winky,\u201d said Harry, struck by a sudden inspiration, walking over to her, and bending down, \u201cyou don\u2019t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to, do you? Because he\u2019s stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament.\u201d\n\nWinky\u2019s eyes flickered. Her enormous pupils focused on Harry. She swayed slightly again and then said, \u201cM \u2014 Master is stopped \u2014 hic \u2014 coming?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen him since the first task. The Daily Prophet\u2019s saying he\u2019s ill.\u201d\n\nWinky swayed some more, staring blurrily at Harry.\n\n\u201cMaster \u2014 hic \u2014 ill?\u201d\n\nHer bottom lip began to tremble.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s true,\u201d said Hermione quickly.\n\n\u201cMaster is needing his \u2014 hic \u2014 Winky!\u201d whimpered the elf. \u201cMaster cannot \u2014 hic \u2014 manage \u2014 hic \u2014 all by himself. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOther people manage to do their own housework, you know, Winky,\u201d Hermione said severely.\n\n\u201cWinky \u2014 hic \u2014 is not only \u2014 hic \u2014 doing housework for Mr. Crouch!\u201d Winky squeaked indignantly, swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse. \u201cMaster is \u2014 hic \u2014 trusting Winky with \u2014 hic \u2014 the most important \u2014 hic \u2014 the most secret \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\nBut Winky shook her head very hard, spilling more butterbeer down herself.\n\n\u201cWinky keeps \u2014 hic \u2014 her master\u2019s secrets,\u201d she said mutinously, swaying very heavily now, frowning up at Harry with her eyes crossed. \u201cYou is \u2014 hic \u2014 nosing, you is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWinky must not talk like that to Harry Potter!\u201d said Dobby angrily. \u201cHarry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is nosing \u2014 hic \u2014 into my master\u2019s \u2014 hic \u2014 private and secret \u2014 hic \u2014 Winky is a good house-elf \u2014 hic \u2014 Winky keeps her silence \u2014 hic \u2014 people trying to \u2014 hic \u2014 pry and poke \u2014 hic \u2014\u201d\n\nWinky\u2019s eyelids drooped and suddenly, without warning, she slid off her stool into the hearth, snoring loudly. The empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stone-flagged floor. Half a dozen house-elves came hurrying forward, looking disgusted. One of them picked up the bottle; the others covered Winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly, hiding her from view.\n\n\u201cWe is sorry you had to see that, sirs and miss!\u201d squeaked a nearby elf, shaking his head and looking very ashamed. \u201cWe is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky, sirs and miss!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s unhappy!\u201d said Hermione, exasperated. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up?\u201d\n\n\u201cBegging your pardon, miss,\u201d said the house-elf, bowing deeply again, \u201cbut house-elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh for heaven\u2019s sake!\u201d Hermione cried. \u201cListen to me, all of you! You\u2019ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy! You\u2019ve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes, you don\u2019t have to do everything you\u2019re told \u2014 look at Dobby!\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss will please keep Dobby out of this,\u201d Dobby mumbled, looking scared. The cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the house-elves around the kitchen. They were suddenly looking at Hermione as though she were mad and dangerous.\n\n\u201cWe has your extra food!\u201d squeaked an elf at Harry\u2019s elbow, and he shoved a large ham, a dozen cakes, and some fruit into Harry\u2019s arms. \u201cGood-bye!\u201d\n\nThe house-elves crowded around Harry, Ron, and Hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen, many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs.\n\n\u201cThank you for the socks, Harry Potter!\u201d Dobby called miserably from the hearth, where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was Winky.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t keep your mouth shut, could you, Hermione?\u201d said Ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them. \u201cThey won\u2019t want us visiting them now! We could\u2019ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh as if you care about that!\u201d scoffed Hermione. \u201cYou only like coming down here for the food!\u201d\n\nIt was an irritable sort of day after that. Harry got so tired of Ron and Hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took Sirius\u2019s food up to the Owlery that evening on his own.\n\nPigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself, so Harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well. When they had set off into the dusk, looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them, Harry leaned on the windowsill, looking out at the grounds, at the dark, rustling treetops of the Forbidden Forest, and the rippling sails of the Durmstrang ship. An eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from Hagrid\u2019s chimney; it soared toward the castle, around the Owlery, and out of sight. Looking down, Harry saw Hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin. Harry wondered what he was doing; it looked as though he were making a new vegetable patch. As he watched, Madame Maxime emerged from the Beauxbatons carriage and walked over to Hagrid. She appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation. Hagrid leaned upon his spade, but did not seem keen to prolong their talk, because Madame Maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward.\n\nUnwilling to go back to Gryffindor Tower and listen to Ron and Hermione snarling at each other, Harry watched Hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around Harry began to awake, swooshing past him into the night.\n\nBy breakfast the next day Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s bad moods had burnt out, and to Harry\u2019s relief, Ron\u2019s dark predictions that the house-elves would send substandard food up to the Gryffindor table because Hermione had insulted them proved false; the bacon, eggs, and kippers were quite as good as usual.\n\nWhen the post owls arrived, Hermione looked up eagerly; she seemed to be expecting something.\n\n\u201cPercy won\u2019t\u2019ve had time to answer yet,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe only sent Hedwig yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI\u2019ve taken out a subscription to the Daily Prophet. I\u2019m getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood thinking!\u201d said Harry, also looking up at the owls. \u201cHey, Hermione, I think you\u2019re in luck \u2014\u201d\n\nA gray owl was soaring down toward Hermione.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t got a newspaper, though,\u201d she said, looking disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\nBut to her bewilderment, the gray owl landed in front of her plate, closely followed by four barn owls, a brown owl, and a tawny.\n\n\u201cHow many subscriptions did you take out?\u201d said Harry, seizing Hermione\u2019s goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls, all of whom were jostling close to her, trying to deliver their own letter first.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth \u2014 ?\u201d Hermione said, taking the letter from the gray owl, opening it, and starting to read. \u201cOh really!\u201d she sputtered, going rather red.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 oh how ridiculous \u2014\u201d\n\nShe thrust the letter at Harry, who saw that it was not handwritten, but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the Daily Prophet.\n\nYou are a WickEd giRL. HarRy PotTER desErves BeTteR. GO back wherE you cAMe from mUGgle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all like it!\u201d said Hermione desperately, opening one letter after another. \u201c\u2018Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you. . . . \u2019 \u2018You deserve to be boiled in frog spawn. . . . \u2019 Ouch!\u201d\n\nShe had opened the last envelope, and yellowish-green liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands, which began to erupt in large yellow boils.\n\n\u201cUndiluted bubotuber pus!\u201d said Ron, picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing it.\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get up to the hospital wing,\u201d said Harry as the owls around Hermione took flight. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell Professor Sprout where you\u2019ve gone. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI warned her!\u201d said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great Hall, cradling her hands. \u201cI warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter! Look at this one . . .\u201d He read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind: \u201c\u2018I read in Witch Weekly about how you are playing Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.\u2019 Blimey, she\u2019d better watch out for herself.\u201d\n\nHermione didn\u2019t turn up for Herbology. As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle. Pansy Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls. Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called, \u201cPotter, have you split up with your girlfriend? Why was she so upset at breakfast?\u201d\n\nHarry ignored her; he didn\u2019t want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused.\n\nHagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet. Harry\u2019s heart sank at the sight of the crates \u2014 surely not another skrewt hatching? \u2014 but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of fluffy black creatures with long snouts. Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention.\n\n\u201cThese\u2019re nifflers,\u201d said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around. \u201cYeh find \u2019em down mines mostly. They like sparkly stuff. . . . There yeh go, look.\u201d\n\nOne of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson\u2019s watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backward.\n\n\u201cUseful little treasure detectors,\u201d said Hagrid happily. \u201cThought we\u2019d have some fun with \u2019em today. See over there?\u201d He pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window. \u201cI\u2019ve buried some gold coins. I\u2019ve got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most. Jus\u2019 take off all yer valuables, an\u2019 choose a niffler, an\u2019 get ready ter set \u2019em loose.\u201d\n\nHarry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn\u2019t work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket. Then he picked up a niffler. It put its long snout in Harry\u2019s ear and sniffed enthusiastically. It was really quite cuddly.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, \u201cthere\u2019s a spare niffler here . . . who\u2019s missin\u2019? Where\u2019s Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had to go to the hospital wing,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll explain later,\u201d Harry muttered; Pansy Parkinson was listening.\n\nIt was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures. The nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water, each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands. Ron\u2019s was particularly efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.\n\n\u201cCan you buy these as pets, Hagrid?\u201d he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil, splattering his robes.\n\n\u201cYer mum wouldn\u2019 be happy, Ron,\u201d said Hagrid, grinning. \u201cThey wreck houses, nifflers. I reckon they\u2019ve nearly got the lot, now,\u201d he added, pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive. \u201cI on\u2019y buried a hundred coins. Oh there y\u2019are, Hermione!\u201d\n\nHermione was walking toward them across the lawn. Her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable. Pansy Parkinson was watching her beadily.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s check how yeh\u2019ve done!\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cCount yer coins! An\u2019 there\u2019s no point tryin\u2019 ter steal any, Goyle,\u201d he added, his beetle-black eyes narrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s leprechaun gold. Vanishes after a few hours.\u201d\n\nGoyle emptied his pockets, looking extremely sulky. It turned out that Ron\u2019s niffler had been most successful, so Hagrid gave him an enormous slab of Honeydukes chocolate for a prize. The bell rang across the grounds for lunch; the rest of the class set off back to the castle, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed behind to help Hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes. Harry noticed Madame Maxime watching them out of her carriage window.\n\n\u201cWhat yeh done ter your hands, Hermione?\u201d said Hagrid, looking concerned.\n\nHermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning, and the envelope full of bubotuber pus.\n\n\u201cAaah, don\u2019 worry,\u201d said Hagrid gently, looking down at her. \u201cI got some o\u2019 those letters an\u2019 all, after Rita Skeeter wrote abou\u2019 me mum. \u2018Yeh\u2019re a monster an\u2019 yeh should be put down.\u2019 \u2018Yer mother killed innocent people an\u2019 if you had any decency you\u2019d jump in a lake.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione, looking shocked.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall. \u201cThey\u2019re jus\u2019 nutters, Hermione. Don\u2019 open \u2019em if yeh get any more. Chuck \u2019em straigh\u2019 in the fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou missed a really good lesson,\u201d Harry told Hermione as they headed back toward the castle. \u201cThey\u2019re good, nifflers, aren\u2019t they, Ron?\u201d\n\nRon, however, was frowning at the chocolate Hagrid had given him. He looked thoroughly put out about something.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWrong flavor?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron shortly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about the gold?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat gold?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThe gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThe leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn\u2019t you tell me it disappeared?\u201d\n\nHarry had to think for a moment before he realized what Ron was talking about.\n\n\u201cOh . . .\u201d he said, the memory coming back to him at last. \u201cI dunno . . . I never noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nThey climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the Great Hall for lunch.\n\n\u201cMust be nice,\u201d Ron said abruptly, when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and Yorkshire puddings. \u201cTo have so much money you don\u2019t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, I had other stuff on my mind that night!\u201d said Harry impatiently. \u201cWe all did, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know leprechaun gold vanishes,\u201d Ron muttered. \u201cI thought I was paying you back. You shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cForget it, all right?\u201d said Harry.\n\nRon speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it. Then he said, \u201cI hate being poor.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other. Neither of them really knew what to say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rubbish,\u201d said Ron, still glaring down at his potato. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a niffler.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we know what to get you next Christmas,\u201d said Hermione brightly. Then, when Ron continued to look gloomy, she said, \u201cCome on, Ron, it could be worse. At least your fingers aren\u2019t full of pus.\u201d Hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork, her fingers were so stiff and swollen. \u201cI hate that Skeeter woman!\u201d she burst out savagely. \u201cI\u2019ll get her back for this if it\u2019s the last thing I do!\u201d\n\nHate mail continued to arrive for Hermione over the following week, and although she followed Hagrid\u2019s advice and stopped opening it, several of her ill-wishers sent Howlers, which exploded at the Gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole Hall to hear. Even those people who didn\u2019t read Witch Weekly knew all about the supposed Harry\u2013Krum\u2013Hermione triangle now. Harry was getting sick of telling people that Hermione wasn\u2019t his girlfriend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll die down, though,\u201d he told Hermione, \u201cif we just ignore it. . . . People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know how she\u2019s listening into private conversations when she\u2019s supposed to be banned from the grounds!\u201d said Hermione angrily.\n\nHermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class was very eager to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex-deflection that many of them were nursing small injuries. Harry had such a bad case of Twitchy Ears, he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class.\n\n\u201cWell, Rita\u2019s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak!\u201d Hermione panted five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron in the entrance hall and pulling Harry\u2019s hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her. \u201cMoody says he didn\u2019t see her anywhere near the judges\u2019 table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake!\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione stubbornly. \u201cI want to know how she heard me talking to Viktor! And how she found out about Hagrid\u2019s mum!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe she had you bugged,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBugged?\u201d said Ron blankly. \u201cWhat . . . put fleas on her or something?\u201d\n\nHarry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment. Ron was fascinated, but Hermione interrupted them.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you two ever going to read Hogwarts: A History?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou know it by heart, we can just ask you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those substitutes for magic Muggles use \u2014 electricity, computers, and radar, and all those things \u2014 they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there\u2019s too much magic in the air. No, Rita\u2019s using magic to eavesdrop, she must be. . . . If I could just find out what it is . . . ooh, if it\u2019s illegal, I\u2019ll have her . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t we got enough to worry about?\u201d Ron asked her. \u201cDo we have to start a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to help!\u201d Hermione snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll do it on my own!\u201d\n\nShe marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance. Harry was quite sure she was going to the library.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the betting she comes back with a box of I Hate Rita Skeeter badges?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHermione, however, did not ask Harry and Ron to help her pursue vengeance against Rita Skeeter, for which they were both grateful, because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the Easter holidays. Harry frankly marveled at the fact that Hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do. He was working flat-out just to get through all their homework, though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for Sirius; after last summer, Harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry. He enclosed notes to Sirius, telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and that they were still waiting for an answer from Percy.\n\nHedwig didn\u2019t return until the end of the Easter holidays. Percy\u2019s letter was enclosed in a package of Easter eggs that Mrs. Weasley had sent. Both Harry\u2019s and Ron\u2019s were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee. Hermione\u2019s, however, was smaller than a chicken egg. Her face fell when she saw it.\n\n\u201cYour mum doesn\u2019t read Witch Weekly, by any chance, does she, Ron?\u201d she asked quietly.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, whose mouth was full of toffee. \u201cGets it for the recipes.\u201d\n\nHermione looked sadly at her tiny egg.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see what Percy\u2019s written?\u201d Harry asked her hastily.\n\nPercy\u2019s letter was short and irritated.\n\nAs I am constantly telling the Daily Prophet, Mr. Crouch is taking a well-deserved break. He is sending in regular owls with instructions. No, I haven\u2019t actually seen him, but I think I can be trusted to know my own superior\u2019s handwriting. I have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors. Please don\u2019t bother me again unless it\u2019s something important. Happy Easter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe start of the summer term would normally have meant that Harry was training hard for the last Quidditch match of the season. This year, however, it was the third and final task in the Triwizard Tournament for which he needed to prepare, but he still didn\u2019t know what he would have to do. Finally, in the last week of May, Professor McGonagall held him back in Transfiguration.\n\n\u201cYou are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o\u2019clock, Potter,\u201d she told him. \u201cMr. Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task.\u201d\n\nSo at half past eight that night, Harry left Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor Tower and went downstairs. As he crossed the entrance hall, Cedric came up from the Hufflepuff common room.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon it\u2019s going to be?\u201d he asked Harry as they went together down the stone steps, out into the cloudy night. \u201cFleur keeps going on about underground tunnels; she reckons we\u2019ve got to find treasure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be too bad,\u201d said Harry, thinking that he would simply ask Hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him.\n\nThey walked down the dark lawn to the Quidditch stadium, turned through a gap in the stands, and walked out onto the field.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve they done to it?\u201d Cedric said indignantly, stopping dead.\n\nThe Quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat. It looked as though somebody had been building long, low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in every direction.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hedges!\u201d said Harry, bending to examine the nearest one.\n\n\u201cHello there!\u201d called a cheery voice.\n\nLudo Bagman was standing in the middle of the field with Krum and Fleur. Harry and Cedric made their way toward them, climbing over the hedges. Fleur beamed at Harry as he came nearer. Her attitude toward him had changed completely since he had saved her sister from the lake.\n\n\u201cWell, what d\u2019you think?\u201d said Bagman happily as Harry and Cedric climbed over the last hedge. \u201cGrowing nicely, aren\u2019t they? Give them a month and Hagrid\u2019ll have them twenty feet high. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d he added, grinning, spotting the less-than-happy expressions on Harry\u2019s and Cedric\u2019s faces, \u201cyou\u2019ll have your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is over! Now, I imagine you can guess what we\u2019re making here?\u201d\n\nNo one spoke for a moment. Then \u2014\n\n\u201cMaze,\u201d grunted Krum.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d said Bagman. \u201cA maze. The third task\u2019s really very straightforward. The Triwizard Cup will be placed in the center of the maze. The first champion to touch it will receive full marks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seemply \u2019ave to get through the maze?\u201d said Fleur.\n\n\u201cThere will be obstacles,\u201d said Bagman happily, bouncing on the balls of his feet. \u201cHagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . then there will be spells that must be broken . . . all that sort of thing, you know. Now, the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze.\u201d Bagman grinned at Harry and Cedric. \u201cThen Mr. Krum will enter . . . then Miss Delacour. But you\u2019ll all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles. Should be fun, eh?\u201d\n\nHarry, who knew only too well the kind of creatures that Hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this, thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all. However, he nodded politely like the other champions.\n\n\u201cVery well . . . if you haven\u2019t got any questions, we\u2019ll go back up to the castle, shall we, it\u2019s a bit chilly. . . .\u201d\n\nBagman hurried alongside Harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze. Harry had the feeling that Bagman was going to start offering to help him again, but just then, Krum tapped Harry on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cCould I haff a vord?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d said Harry, slightly surprised.\n\n\u201cVill you valk vith me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry curiously.\n\nBagman looked slightly perturbed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you, Harry, shall I?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, Mr. Bagman,\u201d said Harry, suppressing a smile, \u201cI think I can find the castle on my own, thanks.\u201d\n\nHarry and Krum left the stadium together, but Krum did not set a course for the Durmstrang ship. Instead, he walked toward the forest.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re we going this way for?\u201d said Harry as they passed Hagrid\u2019s cabin and the illuminated Beauxbatons carriage.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t vont to be overheard,\u201d said Krum shortly.\n\nWhen at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the Beauxbatons horses\u2019 paddock, Krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face Harry.\n\n\u201cI vant to know,\u201d he said, glowering, \u201cvot there is between you and Hermy-own-ninny.\u201d\n\nHarry, who from Krum\u2019s secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this, stared up at Krum in amazement.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. But Krum glowered at him, and Harry, somehow struck anew by how tall Krum was, elaborated. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. She\u2019s not my girlfriend and she never has been. It\u2019s just that Skeeter woman making things up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHermy-own-ninny talks about you very often,\u201d said Krum, looking suspiciously at Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbecause we\u2019re friends.\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t quite believe he was having this conversation with Viktor Krum, the famous International Quidditch player. It was as though the eighteen-year-old Krum thought he, Harry, was an equal \u2014 a real rival \u2014\n\n\u201cYou haff never . . . you haff not . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry very firmly.\n\nKrum looked slightly happier. He stared at Harry for a few seconds, then said, \u201cYou fly very vell. I vos votching at the first task.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself. \u201cI saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint, you really \u2014\u201d\n\nBut something moved behind Krum in the trees, and Harry, who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest, instinctively grabbed Krum\u2019s arm and pulled him around.\n\n\u201cVot is it?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head, staring at the place where he\u2019d seen movement. He slipped his hand inside his robes, reaching for his wand.\n\nSuddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak. For a moment, Harry didn\u2019t recognize him . . . then he realized it was Mr. Crouch.\n\nHe looked as though he had been traveling for days. The knees of his robes were ripped and bloody, his face scratched; he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion. His neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim. His strange appearance, however, was nothing to the way he was behaving. Muttering and gesticulating, Mr. Crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see. He reminded Harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the Dursleys. That man too had been conversing wildly with thin air; Aunt Petunia had seized Dudley\u2019s hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him; Uncle Vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants.\n\n\u201cVosn\u2019t he a judge?\u201d said Krum, staring at Mr. Crouch. \u201cIsn\u2019t he vith your Ministry?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, hesitated for a moment, then walked slowly toward Mr. Crouch, who did not look at him, but continued to talk to a nearby tree.\n\n\u201c. . . and when you\u2019ve done that, Weatherby, send an owl to Dumbledore confirming the number of Durmstrang students who will be attending the tournament, Karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Crouch?\u201d said Harry cautiously.\n\n\u201c. . . and then send another owl to Madame Maxime, because she might want to up the number of students she\u2019s bringing, now Karkaroff\u2019s made it a round dozen . . . do that, Weatherby, will you? Will you? Will . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch\u2019s eyes were bulging. He stood staring at the tree, muttering soundlessly at it. Then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees.\n\n\u201cMr. Crouch?\u201d Harry said loudly. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\nCrouch\u2019s eyes were rolling in his head. Harry looked around at Krum, who had followed him into the trees, and was looking down at Crouch in alarm.\n\n\u201cVot is wrong with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cListen, you\u2019d better go and get someone \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore!\u201d gasped Mr. Crouch. He reached out and seized a handful of Harry\u2019s robes, dragging him closer, though his eyes were staring over Harry\u2019s head. \u201cI need . . . see . . . Dumbledore. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, \u201cif you get up, Mr. Crouch, we can go up to the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done . . . stupid . . . thing . . .\u201d Mr. Crouch breathed. He looked utterly mad. His eyes were rolling and bulging, and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin. Every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort. \u201cMust . . . tell . . . Dumbledore . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cGet up, Mr. Crouch,\u201d said Harry loudly and clearly. \u201cGet up, I\u2019ll take you to Dumbledore!\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch\u2019s eyes rolled forward onto Harry.\n\n\u201cWho . . . you?\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a student at the school,\u201d said Harry, looking around at Krum for some help, but Krum was hanging back, looking extremely nervous.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not . . . his?\u201d whispered Crouch, his mouth sagging.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, without the faintest idea what Crouch was talking about.\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Harry.\n\nCrouch was pulling him closer; Harry tried to loosen Crouch\u2019s grip on his robes, but it was too powerful.\n\n\u201cWarn . . . Dumbledore . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get Dumbledore if you let go of me,\u201d said Harry. \u201cJust let go, Mr. Crouch, and I\u2019ll get him. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Weatherby, and when you have done that, I would like a cup of tea. My wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight with Mr. and Mrs. Fudge.\u201d\n\nCrouch was now talking fluently to a tree again, and seemed completely unaware that Harry was there, which surprised Harry so much he didn\u2019t notice that Crouch had released him.\n\n\u201cYes, my son has recently gained twelve O.W.L.s, most satisfactory, yes, thank you, yes, very proud indeed. Now, if you could bring me that memo from the Andorran Minister of Magic, I think I will have time to draft a response. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stay here with him!\u201d Harry said to Krum. \u201cI\u2019ll get Dumbledore, I\u2019ll be quicker, I know where his office is \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is mad,\u201d said Krum doubtfully, staring down at Crouch, who was still gabbling to the tree, apparently convinced it was Percy.\n\n\u201cJust stay with him,\u201d said Harry, starting to get up, but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in Mr. Crouch, who seized him hard around the knees and pulled Harry back to the ground.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t . . . leave . . . me!\u201d he whispered, his eyes bulging again. \u201cI . . . escaped . . . must warn . . . must tell . . . see Dumbledore . . . my fault . . . all my fault . . . Bertha . . . dead . . . all my fault . . . my son . . . my fault . . . tell Dumbledore . . . Harry Potter . . . the Dark Lord . . . stronger . . . Harry Potter . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get Dumbledore if you let me go, Mr. Crouch!\u201d said Harry. He looked furiously around at Krum. \u201cHelp me, will you?\u201d\n\nLooking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved forward and squatted down next to Mr. Crouch.\n\n\u201cJust keep him here,\u201d said Harry, pulling himself free of Mr. Crouch. \u201cI\u2019ll be back with Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cHurry, von\u2019t you?\u201d Krum called after him as Harry sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds. They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric, and Fleur had disappeared. Harry tore up the stone steps, through the oak front doors, and off up the marble staircase, toward the second floor.\n\nFive minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor.\n\n\u201cLem \u2014 lemon drop!\u201d he panted at it.\n\nThis was the password to the hidden staircase to Dumbledore\u2019s office \u2014 or at least, it had been two years ago. The password had evidently changed, however, for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside, but stood frozen, glaring at Harry malevolently.\n\n\u201cMove!\u201d Harry shouted at it. \u201cC\u2019mon!\u201d\n\nBut nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it; he knew it was no good. He looked up and down the dark corridor. Perhaps Dumbledore was in the staffroom? He started running as fast as he could toward the staircase \u2014\n\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\n\nHarry skidded to a halt and looked around. Snape had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle. The wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned Harry back toward him.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to see Professor Dumbledore!\u201d said Harry, running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of Snape instead. \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Crouch . . . he\u2019s just turned up . . . he\u2019s in the forest . . . he\u2019s asking \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is this rubbish?\u201d said Snape, his black eyes glittering. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Crouch!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cFrom the Ministry! He\u2019s ill or something \u2014 he\u2019s in the forest, he wants to see Dumbledore! Just give me the password up to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe headmaster is busy, Potter,\u201d said Snape, his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell Dumbledore!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me, Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying himself, denying Harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cCrouch isn\u2019t right \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s out of his mind \u2014 he says he wants to warn \u2014\u201d\n\nThe stone wall behind Snape slid open. Dumbledore was standing there, wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d he said, looking between Harry and Snape.\n\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d Harry said, sidestepping Snape before Snape could speak, \u201cMr. Crouch is here \u2014 he\u2019s down in the forest, he wants to speak to you!\u201d\n\nHarry expected Dumbledore to ask questions, but to his relief, Dumbledore did nothing of the sort.\n\n\u201cLead the way,\u201d he said promptly, and he swept off along the corridor behind Harry, leaving Snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly.\n\n\u201cWhat did Mr. Crouch say, Harry?\u201d said Dumbledore as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase.\n\n\u201cSaid he wants to warn you . . . said he\u2019s done something terrible . . . he mentioned his son . . . and Bertha Jorkins . . . and \u2014 and Voldemort . . . something about Voldemort getting stronger. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Dumbledore, and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the pitch-darkness.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not acting normally,\u201d Harry said, hurrying along beside Dumbledore. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to know where he is. He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley\u2019s there, and then he changes, and says he needs to see you. . . . I left him with Viktor Krum.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to take longer strides still, so that Harry was running to keep up. \u201cDo you know if anybody else saw Mr. Crouch?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cKrum and I were talking, Mr. Bagman had just finished telling us about the third task, we stayed behind, and then we saw Mr. Crouch coming out of the forest \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d said Dumbledore as the Beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness.\n\n\u201cOver here,\u201d said Harry, moving in front of Dumbledore, leading the way through the trees. He couldn\u2019t hear Crouch\u2019s voice anymore, but he knew where he was going; it hadn\u2019t been much past the Beauxbatons carriage . . . somewhere around here. . . .\n\n\u201cViktor?\u201d Harry shouted.\n\nNo one answered.\n\n\u201cThey were here,\u201d Harry said to Dumbledore. \u201cThey were definitely somewhere around here. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLumos,\u201d Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and holding it up.\n\nIts narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the ground. And then it fell upon a pair of feet.\n\nHarry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was sprawled on the forest floor. He seemed to be unconscious. There was no sign at all of Mr. Crouch. Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids.\n\n\u201cStunned,\u201d he said softly. His half-moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees.\n\n\u201cShould I go and get someone?\u201d said Harry. \u201cMadam Pomfrey?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dumbledore swiftly. \u201cStay here.\u201d\n\nHe raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of Hagrid\u2019s cabin. Harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over Krum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered, \u201cRennervate.\u201d\n\nKrum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw Dumbledore, he tried to sit up, but Dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still.\n\n\u201cHe attacked me!\u201d Krum muttered, putting a hand up to his head. \u201cThe old madman attacked me! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he attacked from behind!\u201d\n\n\u201cLie still for a moment,\u201d Dumbledore said.\n\nThe sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and Hagrid came panting into sight with Fang at his heels. He was carrying his crossbow.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore!\u201d he said, his eyes widening. \u201cHarry \u2014 what the \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHis student has been attacked. When you\u2019ve done that, kindly alert Professor Moody \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need, Dumbledore,\u201d said a wheezy growl. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nMoody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff, his wand lit.\n\n\u201cDamn leg,\u201d he said furiously. \u201cWould\u2019ve been here quicker . . . what\u2019s happened? Snape said something about Crouch \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCrouch?\u201d said Hagrid blankly.\n\n\u201cKarkaroff, please, Hagrid!\u201d said Dumbledore sharply.\n\n\u201cOh yeah . . . right y\u2019are, Professor . . .\u201d said Hagrid, and he turned and disappeared into the dark trees, Fang trotting after him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where Barty Crouch is,\u201d Dumbledore told Moody, \u201cbut it is essential that we find him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m onto it,\u201d growled Moody, and he raised his wand and limped off into the forest.\n\nNeither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakable sounds of Hagrid and Fang returning. Karkaroff was hurrying along behind them. He was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked pale and agitated.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he cried when he saw Krum on the ground and Dumbledore and Harry beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cI vos attacked!\u201d said Krum, sitting up now and rubbing his head. \u201cMr. Crouch or votever his name \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCrouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The Triwizard judge?\u201d\n\n\u201cIgor,\u201d Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn himself up, clutching his furs around him, looking livid.\n\n\u201cTreachery!\u201d he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. \u201cIt is a plot! You and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses, Dumbledore! This is not an equal competition! First you sneak Potter into the tournament, though he is underage! Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international Wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences \u2014 here\u2019s what I think of you!\u201d\n\nKarkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore\u2019s feet. In one swift movement, Hagrid seized the front of Karkaroff\u2019s furs, lifted him into the air, and slammed him against a nearby tree.\n\n\u201cApologize!\u201d Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for breath, Hagrid\u2019s massive fist at his throat, his feet dangling in midair.\n\n\u201cHagrid, no!\u201d Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.\n\nHagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the tree, and Karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots; a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head.\n\n\u201cKindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore sharply.\n\nBreathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering look.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019d better stay here, Headmaster. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will take Harry back to school, Hagrid,\u201d Dumbledore repeated firmly. \u201cTake him right up to Gryffindor Tower. And Harry \u2014 I want you to stay there. Anything you might want to do \u2014 any owls you might want to send \u2014 they can wait until morning, do you understand me?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yes,\u201d said Harry, staring at him. How had Dumbledore known that, at that very moment, he had been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to Sirius, to tell him what had happened?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,\u201d Hagrid said, staring menacingly at Karkaroff, who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and tree roots. \u201cStay, Fang. C\u2019mon, Harry.\u201d\n\nThey marched in silence past the Beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle.\n\n\u201cHow dare he,\u201d Hagrid growled as they strode past the lake. \u201cHow dare he accuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore\u2019d do anythin\u2019 like that. Like Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs\u2019 place. Worried! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he\u2019s bin lately. An\u2019 you!\u201d Hagrid suddenly said angrily to Harry, who looked up at him, taken aback. \u201cWhat were yeh doin\u2019, wanderin\u2019 off with ruddy Krum? He\u2019s from Durmstrang, Harry! Coulda jinxed yeh right there, couldn\u2019 he? Hasn\u2019 Moody taught yeh nothin\u2019? \u2019Magine lettin\u2019 him lure yeh off on yer own \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKrum\u2019s all right!\u201d said Harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t trying to jinx me, he just wanted to talk about Hermione \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be havin\u2019 a few words with her, an\u2019 all,\u201d said Hagrid grimly, stomping up the stairs. \u201cThe less you lot \u2019ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh\u2019ll be. Yeh can\u2019 trust any of \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were getting on all right with Madame Maxime,\u201d Harry said, annoyed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 you talk ter me abou\u2019 her!\u201d said Hagrid, and he looked quite frightening for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve got her number now! Tryin\u2019 ter get back in me good books, tryin\u2019 ter get me ter tell her what\u2019s comin\u2019 in the third task. Ha! You can\u2019 trust any of \u2019em!\u201d\n\nHagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad to say good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady. He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting, to tell them what had happened."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter29": "THE DREAM\n\n\n\n\nIt comes down to this,\u201d said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. \u201cEither Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must\u2019ve been Crouch,\u201d said Ron at once. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He\u2019d done a runner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head. \u201cHe seemed really weak \u2014 I don\u2019t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven\u2019t I told you enough times?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cOkay . . . how\u2019s this for a theory,\u201d said Ron excitedly. \u201cKrum attacked Crouch \u2014 no, wait for it \u2014 and then Stunned himself!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?\u201d said Hermione coldly.\n\n\u201cOh yeah . . .\u201d\n\nIt was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch.\n\n\u201cJust go through it again, Harry,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWhat did Mr. Crouch actually say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you, he wasn\u2019t making much sense,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He mentioned his son.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that was his fault,\u201d said Hermione testily.\n\n\u201cHe was out of his mind,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHalf the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd . . . remind me what he said about You-Know-Who?\u201d said Ron tentatively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you,\u201d Harry repeated dully. \u201cHe said he\u2019s getting stronger.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice, \u201cBut he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort,\u201d said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound of the name. \u201cHe was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nHarry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters. The many perches were half-empty; every now and then, another owl would swoop in through one of the windows, returning from its night\u2019s hunting with a mouse in its beak.\n\n\u201cIf Snape hadn\u2019t held me up,\u201d Harry said bitterly, \u201cwe might\u2019ve got there in time. \u2018The headmaster is busy, Potter . . . what\u2019s this rubbish, Potter?\u2019 Why couldn\u2019t he have just got out of the way?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t want you to get there!\u201d said Ron quickly. \u201cMaybe \u2014 hang on \u2014 how fast d\u2019you reckon he could\u2019ve gotten down to the forest? D\u2019you reckon he could\u2019ve beaten you and Dumbledore there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot unless he can turn himself into a bat or something,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t put it past him,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cWe need to see Professor Moody,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he had the Marauder\u2019s Map on him, it would\u2019ve been easy,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cUnless Crouch was already outside the grounds,\u201d said Ron, \u201cbecause it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShh!\u201d said Hermione suddenly.\n\nSomebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery. Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer.\n\n\u201c\u2014 that\u2019s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 we\u2019ve tried being polite; it\u2019s time to play dirty, like him. He wouldn\u2019t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, if you put that in writing, it\u2019s blackmail!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and you won\u2019t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff, will you?\u201d\n\nThe Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d Ron and Fred said at the same time.\n\n\u201cSending a letter,\u201d said Harry and George in unison.\n\n\u201cWhat, at this time?\u201d said Hermione and Fred.\n\nFred grinned.\n\n\u201cFine \u2014 we won\u2019t ask you what you\u2019re doing, if you don\u2019t ask us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered.\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t let us hold you up,\u201d Fred said, making a mock bow and pointing at the door.\n\nRon didn\u2019t move. \u201cWho\u2019re you blackmailing?\u201d he said.\n\nThe grin vanished from Fred\u2019s face. Harry saw George half glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, I was only joking,\u201d he said easily.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t sound like that,\u201d said Ron.\n\nFred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said abruptly, \u201cI\u2019ve told you before, Ron, keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is. Can\u2019t see why you would, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my business if you\u2019re blackmailing someone,\u201d said Ron. \u201cGeorge\u2019s right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cTold you, I was joking,\u201d said George. He walked over to Fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother, you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you\u2019ll be made a prefect.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t!\u201d said Ron hotly.\n\nGeorge carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off. George turned around and grinned at Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, stop telling people what to do then. See you later.\u201d\n\nHe and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they know something about all this, do you?\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cAbout Crouch and everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIf it was something that serious, they\u2019d tell someone. They\u2019d tell Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nRon, however, was looking uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Hermione asked him.\n\n\u201cWell . . .\u201d said Ron slowly, \u201cI dunno if they would. They\u2019re . . . they\u2019re obsessed with making money lately, I noticed it when I was hanging around with them \u2014 when \u2014 you know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t talking.\u201d Harry finished the sentence for him. \u201cYeah, but blackmail . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this joke shop idea they\u2019ve got,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but they really mean it, they want to start one. They\u2019ve only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it\u2019s time to think about their future, and Dad can\u2019t help them, and they need gold to get started.\u201d\n\nHermione was looking uncomfortable now.\n\n\u201cYes, but . . . they wouldn\u2019t do anything against the law to get gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t they?\u201d said Ron, looking skeptical. \u201cI dunno . . . they don\u2019t exactly mind breaking rules, do they?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but this is the law,\u201d said Hermione, looking scared. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some silly school rule. . . . They\u2019ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron . . . maybe you\u2019d better tell Percy. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you mad?\u201d said Ron. \u201cTell Percy? He\u2019d probably do a Crouch and turn them in.\u201d He stared at the window through which Fred and George\u2019s owl had departed, then said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get some breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think it\u2019s too early to go and see Professor Moody?\u201d Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe\u2019d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he\u2019ll think we\u2019re trying to attack him while he\u2019s asleep. Let\u2019s give it till break.\u201d\n\nHistory of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept checking Ron\u2019s watch, having finally discarded his own, but Ron\u2019s was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn\u2019t taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus.\n\nWhen the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual.\n\n\u201cProfessor Moody?\u201d Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd.\n\n\u201cHello, Potter,\u201d growled Moody. His magical eye followed a couple of passing first years, who sped up, looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody\u2019s head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again.\n\n\u201cCome in here.\u201d\n\nHe stood back to let them into his empty classroom, limped in after them, and closed the door.\n\n\u201cDid you find him?\u201d Harry asked without preamble. \u201cMr. Crouch?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan, and pulled out his hip flask.\n\n\u201cDid you use the map?\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Moody, taking a swig from his flask. \u201cTook a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn\u2019t anywhere on there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he did Disapparate?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t Disapparate on the grounds, Ron!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThere are other ways he could have disappeared, aren\u2019t there, Professor?\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione. \u201cYou\u2019re another one who might think about a career as an Auror,\u201d he told her. \u201cMind works the right way, Granger.\u201d\n\nHermione flushed pink with pleasure.\n\n\u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t invisible,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe map shows invisible people. He must\u2019ve left the grounds, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut under his own steam?\u201d said Hermione eagerly, \u201cor because someone made him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, someone could\u2019ve \u2014 could\u2019ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn\u2019t they?\u201d said Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t rule out kidnap,\u201d growled Moody.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Ron, \u201cd\u2019you reckon he\u2019s somewhere in Hogsmeade?\u201d\n\n\u201cCould be anywhere,\u201d said Moody, shaking his head. \u201cOnly thing we know for sure is that he\u2019s not here.\u201d\n\nHe yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth. Then he said, \u201cNow, Dumbledore\u2019s told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there\u2019s nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry\u2019ll be looking for him now, Dumbledore\u2019s notified them. Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cOh yeah . . .\u201d\n\nHe hadn\u2019t given the maze a single thought since he\u2019d left it with Krum the previous night.\n\n\u201cShould be right up your street, this one,\u201d said Moody, looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin. \u201cFrom what Dumbledore\u2019s said, you\u2019ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times. Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone in your first year, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe helped,\u201d Ron said quickly. \u201cMe and Hermione helped.\u201d\n\nMoody grinned.\n\n\u201cWell, help him practice for this one, and I\u2019ll be very surprised if he doesn\u2019t win,\u201d said Moody. \u201cIn the meantime . . . constant vigilance, Potter. Constant vigilance.\u201d He took another long draw from his hip flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window. The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it.\n\n\u201cYou two,\u201d counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and Hermione, \u201cyou stick close to Potter, all right? I\u2019m keeping an eye on things, but all the same . . . you can never have too many eyes out.\u201d\n\nSirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It fluttered down beside Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione, clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, \u201cHa! She hasn\u2019t got wind of Crouch!\u201d then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last.\n\nHarry \u2014 what do you think you are playing at, walking off into the forest with Viktor Krum? I want you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night. There is somebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts. It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark. You could have been killed.\n\nYour name didn\u2019t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident. If someone\u2019s trying to attack you, they\u2019re on their last chance. Stay close to Ron and Hermione, do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm yourself for the third task. Practice Stunning and Disarming. A few hexes wouldn\u2019t go amiss either. There\u2019s nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your head down and look after yourself. I\u2019m waiting for your letter giving me your word you won\u2019t stray out-of-bounds again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?\u201d said Harry in mild indignation as he folded up Sirius\u2019s letter and put it inside his robes. \u201cAfter all the stuff he did at school!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s worried about you!\u201d said Hermione sharply. \u201cJust like Moody and Hagrid! So listen to them!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s tried to attack me all year,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo one\u2019s done anything to me at all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept put your name in the Goblet of Fire,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd they must\u2019ve done that for a reason, Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they\u2019ve been biding their time. Maybe this is the task they\u2019re going to get you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Harry impatiently, \u201clet\u2019s say Sirius is right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch. Well, they would\u2019ve been in the trees near us, wouldn\u2019t they? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted, didn\u2019t they? So it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m their target, does it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t have made it look like an accident if they\u2019d murdered you in the forest!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut if you die during a task \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t care about attacking Krum, did they?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just polish me off at the same time? They could\u2019ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, I don\u2019t understand it either,\u201d said Hermione desperately. \u201cI just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don\u2019t like it. . . . Moody\u2019s right \u2014 Sirius is right \u2014 you\u2019ve got to get in training for the third task, straight away. And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you\u2019re not going to go sneaking off alone again.\u201d\n\nThe Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to stay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?\u201d Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. \u201cLet\u2019s Stun her for a bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he\u2019d do anything to help you. I\u2019m not complaining or anything\u201d \u2014 he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside \u2014 \u201cbut I\u2019m aching all over. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you keep missing the cushions, don\u2019t you!\u201d said Hermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. \u201cJust try and fall backward!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re Stunned, you can\u2019t aim too well, Hermione!\u201d said Ron angrily. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a turn?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think Harry\u2019s got it now, anyway,\u201d said Hermione hastily. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have to worry about Disarming, because he\u2019s been able to do that for ages. . . . I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening.\u201d\n\nShe looked down the list they had made in the library.\n\n\u201cI like the look of this one,\u201d she said, \u201cthis Impediment Curse. Should slow down anything that\u2019s trying to attack you, Harry. We\u2019ll start with that one.\u201d\n\nThe bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back into Flitwick\u2019s cupboard and slipped out of the classroom.\n\n\u201cSee you at dinner!\u201d said Hermione, and she set off for Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight fell across the corridor from the high windows. The sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be boiling in Trelawney\u2019s room, she never puts out that fire,\u201d said Ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor.\n\nHe was quite right. The dimly lit room was swelteringly hot. The fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever. Harry\u2019s head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows. While Professor Trelawney was looking the other way, disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so that a soft breeze played across his face. It was extremely comfortable.\n\n\u201cMy dears,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes, \u201cwe have almost finished our work on planetary divination. Today, however, will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is placed most interestingly at the present time. If you will all look this way, I will dim the lights. . . .\u201d\n\nShe waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire was the only source of light now. Professor Trelawney bent down and lifted, from under her chair, a miniature model of the solar system, contained within a glass dome. It was a beautiful thing; each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass. Harry watched lazily as Professor Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle Mars was making to Neptune. The heavily perfumed fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the window played across his face. He could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain. His eyelids began to droop. . . .\n\nHe was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old, ivy-covered house set high on a hillside. Lower and lower they flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry\u2019s face, until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house and entered. Now they were flying along a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end . . . through the door they went, into a dark room whose windows were boarded up. . . .\n\nHarry had left the owl\u2019s back . . . he was watching, now, as it fluttered across the room, into a chair with its back to him. . . . There were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair . . . both of them were stirring. . . .\n\nOne was a huge snake . . . the other was a man . . . a short, balding man, a man with watery eyes and a pointed nose . . . he was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug. . . .\n\n\u201cYou are in luck, Wormtail,\u201d said a cold, high-pitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed. \u201cYou are very fortunate indeed. Your blunder has not ruined everything. He is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord!\u201d gasped the man on the floor. \u201cMy Lord, I am . . . I am so pleased . . . and so sorry. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNagini,\u201d said the cold voice, \u201cyou are out of luck. I will not be feeding Wormtail to you, after all . . . but never mind, never mind . . . there is still Harry Potter. . . .\u201d\n\nThe snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue fluttering.\n\n\u201cNow, Wormtail,\u201d said the cold voice, \u201cperhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord . . . no . . . I beg you . . .\u201d\n\nThe tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair. It was pointing at Wormtail.\n\n\u201cCrucio!\u201d said the cold voice.\n\nWormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire, the screaming filled Harry\u2019s ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he was yelling too. . . . Voldemort would hear him, would know he was there. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry!\u201d\n\nHarry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of Professor Trelawney\u2019s room with his hands over his face. His scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering. The pain had been real. The whole class was standing around him, and Ron was kneeling next to him, looking terrified.\n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf course he isn\u2019t!\u201d said Professor Trelawney, looking thoroughly excited. Her great eyes loomed over Harry, gazing at him. \u201cWhat was it, Potter? A premonition? An apparition? What did you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself shaking. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from looking around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemort\u2019s voice had sounded so close. . . .\n\n\u201cYou were clutching your scar!\u201d said Professor Trelawney. \u201cYou were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now, Potter, I have experience in these matters!\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at her.\n\n\u201cI need to go to the hospital wing, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cBad headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!\u201d said Professor Trelawney. \u201cIf you leave now, you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see anything except a headache cure,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe stood up. The class backed away. They all looked unnerved.\n\n\u201cSee you later,\u201d Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression of great frustration, as though she had just been denied a real treat.\n\nWhen Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder, however, he did not set off for the hospital wing. He had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again, and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was going straight to Dumbledore\u2019s office. He marched down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen in the dream . . . it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on Privet Drive. . . . He ran over the details in his mind, trying to make sure he could remember them. . . . He had heard Voldemort accusing Wormtail of making a blunder . . . but the owl had brought good news, the blunder had been repaired, somebody was dead . . . so Wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake . . . he, Harry, was going to be fed to it instead. . . .\n\nHarry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore\u2019s office without noticing. He blinked, looked around, realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it. Then he remembered that he didn\u2019t know the password.\n\n\u201cLemon drop?\u201d he tried tentatively.\n\nThe gargoyle did not move.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, staring at it, \u201cPear Drop. Er \u2014 Licorice Wand. Fizzing Whizbee. Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor Beans . . . oh no, he doesn\u2019t like them, does he? . . . oh just open, can\u2019t you?\u201d he said angrily. \u201cI really need to see him, it\u2019s urgent!\u201d\n\nThe gargoyle remained immovable.\n\nHarry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe.\n\n\u201cChocolate Frog!\u201d he yelled angrily, standing on one leg. \u201cSugar Quill! Cockroach Cluster!\u201d\n\nThe gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry blinked.\n\n\u201cCockroach Cluster?\u201d he said, amazed. \u201cI was only joking. . . .\u201d\n\nHe hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase, which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him, taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker.\n\nHe could hear voices from inside the office. He stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated, listening.\n\n\u201cDumbledore, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t see the connection, don\u2019t see it at all!\u201d It was the voice of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. \u201cLudo says Bertha\u2019s perfectly capable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have expected to have found her by now, but all the same, we\u2019ve no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at all. As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch\u2019s!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do you think\u2019s happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?\u201d said Moody\u2019s growling voice.\n\n\u201cI see two possibilities, Alastor,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cEither Crouch has finally cracked \u2014 more than likely, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree, given his personal history \u2014 lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly.\n\n\u201cOr else \u2014 well . . .\u201d Fudge sounded embarrassed. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll reserve judgment until after I\u2019ve seen the place where he was found, but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you know what that woman is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI consider her to be a very able headmistress \u2014 and an excellent dancer,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly.\n\n\u201cDumbledore, come!\u201d said Fudge angrily. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid? They don\u2019t all turn out harmless \u2014 if, indeed, you can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster fixation he\u2019s got \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, just as calmly. \u201cI think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced, Cornelius.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we wrap up this discussion?\u201d growled Moody.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, let\u2019s go down to the grounds, then,\u201d said Fudge impatiently.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201d said Moody, \u201cit\u2019s just that Potter wants a word with you, Dumbledore. He\u2019s just outside the door.\u201d"}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter30": "THE PENSIEVE\n\n\n\n\nThe door of the office opened.\n\n\u201cHello, Potter,\u201d said Moody. \u201cCome in, then.\u201d\n\nHarry walked inside. He had been inside Dumbledore\u2019s office once before; it was a very beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests rising and falling gently.\n\nCornelius Fudge was standing beside Dumbledore\u2019s desk, wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding his lime-green bowler hat.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d said Fudge jovially, moving forward. \u201cHow are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Harry lied.\n\n\u201cWe were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the grounds,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cIt was you who found him, was it not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. Then, feeling it was pointless to pretend that he hadn\u2019t overheard what they had been saying, he added, \u201cI didn\u2019t see Madame Maxime anywhere, though, and she\u2019d have a job hiding, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nDumbledore smiled at Harry behind Fudge\u2019s back, his eyes twinkling.\n\n\u201cYes, well,\u201d said Fudge, looking embarrassed, \u201cwe\u2019re about to go for a short walk on the grounds, Harry, if you\u2019ll excuse us . . . perhaps if you just go back to your class \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to talk to you, Professor,\u201d Harry said quickly, looking at Dumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look.\n\n\u201cWait here for me, Harry,\u201d he said. \u201cOur examination of the grounds will not take long.\u201d\n\nThey trooped out in silence past him and closed the door. After a minute or so, Harry heard the clunks of Moody\u2019s wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below. He looked around.\n\n\u201cHello, Fawkes,\u201d he said.\n\nFawkes, Professor Dumbledore\u2019s phoenix, was standing on his golden perch beside the door. The size of a swan, with magnificent scarlet-and-gold plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at Harry.\n\nHarry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore\u2019s desk. For several minutes, he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his scar. It had stopped hurting now.\n\nHe felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore\u2019s office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry\u2019s House. He was gazing at it, remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.\n\nA shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery light was coming from the basin\u2019s contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked like light made liquid \u2014 or like wind made solid \u2014 Harry couldn\u2019t make up his mind.\n\nHe wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years\u2019 experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at the contents of the basin, and prodded them.\n\nThe surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.\n\nHarry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery substance had become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked down into it, expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin \u2014 and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.\n\nThe room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there were no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels. An empty chair stood in the very center of the room. There was something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.\n\nWhere was this place? It surely wasn\u2019t Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something; even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one another.\n\nThe basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, Harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it. He leaned even closer, tilting his head, trying to see . . .\n\nThe tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring.\n\nDumbledore\u2019s office gave an almighty lurch \u2014 Harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin \u2014\n\nBut his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling through something icy-cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool \u2014\n\nAnd suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others. He looked up at the high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.\n\nBreathing hard and fast, Harry looked around him. Not one of the witches and wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundred of them) was looking at him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen-year-old boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room.\n\nHe was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean to \u2014 I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet \u2014 I \u2014 where are we?\u201d\n\nBut Dumbledore didn\u2019t move or speak. He ignored Harry completely. Like every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the room, where there was a door.\n\nHarry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at Dumbledore. And then it dawned on him. . . .\n\nOnce before, Harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear him. That time, he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right into somebody else\u2019s memory . . . and unless he was very much mistaken, something of the sort had happened again. . . .\n\nHarry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in front of Dumbledore\u2019s face. Dumbledore did not blink, look around at Harry, or indeed move at all. And that, in Harry\u2019s opinion, settled the matter. Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t ignore him like that. He was inside a memory, and this was not the present-day Dumbledore. Yet it couldn\u2019t be that long ago . . . the Dumbledore sitting next to him now was silver-haired, just like the present-day Dumbledore. But what was this place? What were all these wizards waiting for?\n\nHarry looked around more carefully. The room, as he had suspected when observing it from above, was almost certainly underground \u2014 more of a dungeon than a room, he thought. There was a bleak and forbidding air about the place; there were no pictures on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows of benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms.\n\nBefore Harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were, he heard footsteps. The door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people entered \u2014 or at least one man, flanked by two dementors.\n\nHarry\u2019s insides went cold. The dementors \u2014 tall, hooded creatures whose faces were concealed \u2014 were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room, each grasping one of the man\u2019s arms with their dead and rotten-looking hands. The man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and Harry couldn\u2019t blame him . . . he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but he remembered their power only too well. The watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room. The door swung shut behind them.\n\nHarry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was Karkaroff.\n\nUnlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger; his hair and goatee were black. He was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes. He was shaking. Even as Harry watched, the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up Karkaroff\u2019s arms, binding him there.\n\n\u201cIgor Karkaroff,\u201d said a curt voice to Harry\u2019s left. Harry looked around and saw Mr. Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him. Crouch\u2019s hair was dark, his face was much less lined, he looked fit and alert. \u201cYou have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic. You have given us to understand that you have important information for us.\u201d\n\nKarkaroff straightened himself as best he could, tightly bound to the chair.\n\n\u201cI have, sir,\u201d he said, and although his voice was very scared, Harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it. \u201cI wish to be of use to the Ministry. I wish to help. I \u2014 I know that the Ministry is trying to \u2014 to round up the last of the Dark Lord\u2019s supporters. I am eager to assist in any way I can. . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a murmur around the benches. Some of the wizards and witches were surveying Karkaroff with interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then Harry heard, quite distinctly, from Dumbledore\u2019s other side, a familiar, growling voice saying, \u201cFilth.\u201d\n\nHarry leaned forward so that he could see past Dumbledore. Mad-Eye Moody was sitting there \u2014 except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance. He did not have his magical eye, but two normal ones. Both were looking down upon Karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.\n\n\u201cCrouch is going to let him out,\u201d Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore. \u201cHe\u2019s done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch is going to let him go if he\u2019s got enough new names. Let\u2019s hear his information, I say, and throw him straight back to the dementors.\u201d\n\nDumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.\n\n\u201cAh, I was forgetting . . . you don\u2019t like the dementors, do you, Albus?\u201d said Moody with a sardonic smile.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t. I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut for filth like this . . .\u201d Moody said softly.\n\n\u201cYou say you have names for us, Karkaroff,\u201d said Mr. Crouch. \u201cLet us hear them, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must understand,\u201d said Karkaroff hurriedly, \u201cthat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that we \u2014 I mean to say, his supporters \u2014 and I regret now, very deeply, that I ever counted myself among them \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGet on with it,\u201d sneered Moody.\n\n\u201c\u2014 we never knew the names of every one of our fellows \u2014 He alone knew exactly who we all were \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich was a wise move, wasn\u2019t it, as it prevented someone like you, Karkaroff, from turning all of them in,\u201d muttered Moody.\n\n\u201cYet you say you have some names for us?\u201d said Mr. Crouch.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I do,\u201d said Karkaroff breathlessly. \u201cAnd these were important supporters, mark you. People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding. I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him, and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThese names are?\u201d said Mr. Crouch sharply.\n\nKarkaroff drew a deep breath.\n\n\u201cThere was Antonin Dolohov,\u201d he said. \u201cI \u2014 I saw him torture countless Muggles and \u2014 and non-supporters of the Dark Lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd helped him do it,\u201d murmured Moody.\n\n\u201cWe have already apprehended Dolohov,\u201d said Crouch. \u201cHe was caught shortly after yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. \u201cI \u2014 I am delighted to hear it!\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t look it. Harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him. One of his names was worthless.\n\n\u201cAny others?\u201d said Crouch coldly.\n\n\u201cWhy, yes . . . there was Rosier,\u201d said Karkaroff hurriedly. \u201cEvan Rosier.\u201d\n\n\u201cRosier is dead,\u201d said Crouch. \u201cHe was caught shortly after you were too. He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cTook a bit of me with him, though,\u201d whispered Moody to Harry\u2019s right. Harry looked around at him once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no more than Rosier deserved!\u201d said Karkaroff, a real note of panic in his voice now. Harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the Ministry. Karkaroff\u2019s eyes darted toward the door in the corner, behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood, waiting.\n\n\u201cAny more?\u201d said Crouch.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d said Karkaroff. \u201cThere was Travers \u2014 he helped murder the McKinnons! Mulciber \u2014 he specialized in the Imperius Curse, forced countless people to do horrific things! Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself!\u201d\n\nHarry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck gold. The watching crowd was all murmuring together.\n\n\u201cRookwood?\u201d said Mr. Crouch, nodding to a witch sitting in front of him, who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment. \u201cAugustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very same,\u201d said Karkaroff eagerly. \u201cI believe he used a network of well-placed wizards, both inside the Ministry and out, to collect information \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Travers and Mulciber we have,\u201d said Mr. Crouch. \u201cVery well, Karkaroff, if that is all, you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet!\u201d cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate. \u201cWait, I have more!\u201d\n\nHarry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard.\n\n\u201cSnape!\u201d he shouted. \u201cSeverus Snape!\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape has been cleared by this council,\u201d said Crouch disdainfully. \u201cHe has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that bound him to the chair. \u201cI assure you! Severus Snape is a Death Eater!\u201d\n\nDumbledore had gotten to his feet.\n\n\u201cI have given evidence already on this matter,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cSeverus Snape was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort\u2019s downfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk. He is now no more a Death Eater than I am.\u201d\n\nHarry turned to look at Mad-Eye Moody. He was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind Dumbledore\u2019s back.\n\n\u201cVery well, Karkaroff,\u201d Crouch said coldly, \u201cyou have been of assistance. I shall review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the meantime. . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Crouch\u2019s voice faded. Harry looked around; the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke; everything was fading; he could see only his own body \u2014 all else was swirling darkness. . . .\n\nAnd then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in a different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr. Crouch. The atmosphere seemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful. The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite. She had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end of an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakably, a younger Rita Skeeter. Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes. Mr. Crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer, gaunter. . . . Harry understood. It was a different memory, a different day . . . a different trial.\n\nThe door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman walked into the room.\n\nThis was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed, but a Ludo Bagman who was clearly at the height of his Quidditch-playing fitness. His nose wasn\u2019t broken now; he was tall and lean and muscular. Bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair, but it did not bind him there as it had bound Karkaroff, and Bagman, perhaps taking heart from this, glanced around at the watching crowd, waved at a couple of them, and managed a small smile.\n\n\u201cLudo Bagman, you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters,\u201d said Mr. Crouch. \u201cWe have heard the evidence against you, and are about to reach our verdict. Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment?\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe his ears. Ludo Bagman, a Death Eater?\n\n\u201cOnly,\u201d said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, \u201cwell \u2014 I know I\u2019ve been a bit of an idiot \u2014\u201d\n\nOne or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently. Mr. Crouch did not appear to share their feelings. He was staring down at Ludo Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike.\n\n\u201cYou never spoke a truer word, boy,\u201d someone muttered dryly to Dumbledore behind Harry. He looked around and saw Moody sitting there again. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d always been dim, I\u2019d have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLudovic Bagman, you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort\u2019s supporters,\u201d said Mr. Crouch. \u201cFor this, I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than \u2014\u201d\n\nBut there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches. Several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even their fists, at Mr. Crouch.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve told you, I had no idea!\u201d Bagman called earnestly over the crowd\u2019s babble, his round blue eyes widening. \u201cNone at all! Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad\u2019s . . . never crossed my mind he was in with You-Know-Who! I thought I was collecting information for our side! And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on . . . once my Quidditch days are over, you know . . . I mean, I can\u2019t keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life, can I?\u201d\n\nThere were titters from the crowd.\n\n\u201cIt will be put to the vote,\u201d said Mr. Crouch coldly. He turned to the right-hand side of the dungeon. \u201cThe jury will please raise their hands . . . those in favor of imprisonment . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked toward the right-hand side of the dungeon. Not one person raised their hand. Many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap. One of the witches on the jury stood up.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d barked Crouch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday,\u201d the witch said breathlessly.\n\nMr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing with applause now. Bagman got to his feet and bowed, beaming.\n\n\u201cDespicable,\u201d Mr. Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting down as Bagman walked out of the dungeon. \u201cRookwood get him a job indeed. . . . The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd the dungeon dissolved again. When it had returned, Harry looked around. He and Dumbledore were still sitting beside Mr. Crouch, but the atmosphere could not have been more different. There was total silence, broken only by the dry sobs of a frail, wispy-looking witch in the seat next to Mr. Crouch. She was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands. Harry looked up at Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before. A nerve was twitching in his temple.\n\n\u201cBring them in,\u201d he said, and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon.\n\nThe door in the corner opened yet again. Six dementors entered this time, flanking a group of four people. Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at Mr. Crouch. A few of them whispered to one another.\n\nThe dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor. There was a thickset man who stared blankly up at Crouch; a thinner and more nervous-looking man, whose eyes were darting around the crowd; a woman with thick, shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne; and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of petrified. He was shivering, his straw-colored hair all over his face, his freckled skin milk-white. The wispy little witch beside Crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat, whimpering into her handkerchief.\n\nCrouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in front of him, and there was pure hatred in his face.\n\n\u201cYou have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law,\u201d he said clearly, \u201cso that we may pass judgment on you, for a crime so heinous \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFather,\u201d said the boy with the straw-colored hair. \u201cFather . . . please . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court,\u201d said Crouch, speaking more loudly, drowning out his son\u2019s voice. \u201cWe have heard the evidence against you. The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror \u2014 Frank Longbottom \u2014 and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFather, I didn\u2019t!\u201d shrieked the boy in chains below. \u201cI didn\u2019t, I swear it, Father, don\u2019t send me back to the dementors \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are further accused,\u201d bellowed Mr. Crouch, \u201cof using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom\u2019s wife, when he would not give you information. You planned to restore He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to power, and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMother!\u201d screamed the boy below, and the wispy little witch beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backward and forward. \u201cMother, stop him, Mother, I didn\u2019t do it, it wasn\u2019t me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI now ask the jury,\u201d shouted Mr. Crouch, \u201cto raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!\u201d\n\nIn unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of the dungeon raised their hands. The crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy began to scream.\n\n\u201cNo! Mother, no! I didn\u2019t do it, I didn\u2019t do it, I didn\u2019t know! Don\u2019t send me there, don\u2019t let him!\u201d\n\nThe dementors were gliding back into the room. The boys\u2019 three companions rose quietly from their seats; the woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up at Crouch and called, \u201cThe Dark Lord will rise again, Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will rise again and will come for us, he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were faithful! We alone tried to find him!\u201d\n\nBut the boy was trying to fight off the dementors, even though Harry could see their cold, draining power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering, some of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your son!\u201d he screamed up at Crouch. \u201cI\u2019m your son!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are no son of mine!\u201d bellowed Mr. Crouch, his eyes bulging suddenly. \u201cI have no son!\u201d\n\nThe wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat. She had fainted. Crouch appeared not to have noticed.\n\n\u201cTake them away!\u201d Crouch roared at the dementors, spit flying from his mouth. \u201cTake them away, and may they rot there!\u201d\n\n\u201cFather! Father, I wasn\u2019t involved! No! No! Father, please!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, Harry, it is time to return to my office,\u201d said a quiet voice in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\nHarry started. He looked around. Then he looked on his other side.\n\nThere was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right, watching Crouch\u2019s son being dragged away by the dementors \u2014 and there was an Albus Dumbledore on his left, looking right at him.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put his hand under Harry\u2019s elbow. Harry felt himself rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him; for a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as though he had done a slow-motion somersault, suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like the dazzling light of Dumbledore\u2019s sunlit office. The stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside him.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d Harry gasped, \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean \u2014 the cabinet door was sort of open and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI quite understand,\u201d said Dumbledore. He lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him.\n\nHarry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents had returned to their original, silvery-white state, swirling and rippling beneath his gaze.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Harry asked shakily.\n\n\u201cThis? It is called a Pensieve,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI sometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling, that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry, who couldn\u2019t truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort.\n\n\u201cAt these times,\u201d said Dumbledore, indicating the stone basin, \u201cI use the Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one\u2019s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one\u2019s leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean . . . that stuff\u2019s your thoughts?\u201d Harry said, staring at the swirling white substance in the basin.\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d\n\nDumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it \u2014 but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve. Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl. Dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold . . . and Harry saw his own face change smoothly into Snape\u2019s, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming back . . . Karkaroff\u2019s too . . . stronger and clearer than ever . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cA connection I could have made without assistance,\u201d Dumbledore sighed, \u201cbut never mind.\u201d He peered over the top of his half-moon spectacles at Harry, who was gaping at Snape\u2019s face, which was continuing to swirl around the bowl. \u201cI was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly. Naturally, it would have attracted your attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\nDumbledore shook his head. \u201cCuriosity is not a sin,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we should exercise caution with our curiosity . . . yes, indeed . . .\u201d\n\nFrowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand. Instantly, a figure rose out of it, a plump, scowling girl of about sixteen, who began to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin. She took no notice whatsoever of Harry or Professor Dumbledore. When she spoke, her voice echoed as Snape\u2019s had done, as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin. \u201cHe put a hex on me, Professor Dumbledore, and I was only teasing him, sir, I only said I\u2019d seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why, Bertha,\u201d said Dumbledore sadly, looking up at the now silently revolving girl, \u201cwhy did you have to follow him in the first place?\u201d\n\n\u201cBertha?\u201d Harry whispered, looking up at her. \u201cIs that \u2014 was that Bertha Jorkins?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the basin again; Bertha sank back into them, and they became silvery and opaque once more. \u201cThat was Bertha as I remember her at school.\u201d\n\nThe silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated Dumbledore\u2019s face, and it struck Harry suddenly how very old he was looking. He knew, of course, that Dumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he never really thought of Dumbledore as an old man.\n\n\u201cSo, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cBefore you got lost in my thoughts, you wanted to tell me something.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cProfessor \u2014 I was in Divination just now, and \u2014 er \u2014 I fell asleep.\u201d\n\nHe hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely said, \u201cQuite understandable. Continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I had a dream,\u201d said Harry. \u201cA dream about Lord Voldemort. He was torturing Wormtail . . . you know who Wormtail \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI do know,\u201d said Dumbledore promptly. \u201cPlease continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail\u2019s blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said, Wormtail wouldn\u2019t be fed to the snake \u2014 there was a snake beside his chair. He said \u2014 he said he\u2019d be feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail \u2014 and my scar hurt,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt woke me up, it hurt so badly.\u201d\n\nDumbledore merely looked at him.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 that\u2019s all,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cI see. Now, has your scar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I \u2014 how did you know it woke me up over the summer?\u201d said Harry, astonished.\n\n\u201cYou are not Sirius\u2019s only correspondent,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay.\u201d\n\nDumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk. Every now and then, he placed his wand-tip to his temple, removed another shining silver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that Harry couldn\u2019t make out anything clearly: It was merely a blur of color.\n\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.\n\nDumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.\n\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d he said quietly. He sat back down at his desk.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you \u2014 d\u2019you know why my scar\u2019s hurting me?\u201d\n\nDumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a moment, and then said, \u201cI have a theory, no more than that. . . . It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut . . . why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you and he are connected by the curse that failed,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThat is no ordinary scar.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is possible,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI would say \u2014 probable. Harry \u2014 did you see Voldemort?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cJust the back of his chair. But \u2014 there wouldn\u2019t have been anything to see, would there? I mean, he hasn\u2019t got a body, has he? But . . . but then how could he have held the wand?\u201d Harry said slowly.\n\n\u201cHow indeed?\u201d muttered Dumbledore. \u201cHow indeed . . .\u201d\n\nNeither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while. Dumbledore was gazing across the room, and, every now and then, placing his wand-tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the Pensieve.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d Harry said at last, \u201cdo you think he\u2019s getting stronger?\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort?\u201d said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over the Pensieve. It was the characteristic, piercing look Dumbledore had given him on other occasions, and always made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that even Moody\u2019s magical eye could not. \u201cOnce again, Harry, I can only give you my suspicions.\u201d\n\nDumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and wearier, than ever.\n\n\u201cThe years of Voldemort\u2019s ascent to power,\u201d he said, \u201cwere marked with disappearances. Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last. Mr. Crouch too has disappeared . . . within these very grounds. And there was a third disappearance, one which the Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any importance, for it concerns a Muggle. His name was Frank Bryce, he lived in the village where Voldemort\u2019s father grew up, and he has not been seen since last August. You see, I read the Muggle newspapers, unlike most of my Ministry friends.\u201d\n\nDumbledore looked very seriously at Harry.\n\n\u201cThese disappearances seem to me to be linked. The Ministry disagrees \u2014 as you may have heard, while waiting outside my office.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded. Silence fell between them again, Dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then. Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity held him in his chair.\n\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d he said again.\n\n\u201cYes, Harry?\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cEr . . . could I ask you about . . . that court thing I was in . . . in the Pensieve?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could,\u201d said Dumbledore heavily. \u201cI attended it many times, but some trials come back to me more clearly than others . . . particularly now. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know \u2014 you know the trial you found me in? The one with Crouch\u2019s son? Well . . . were they talking about Neville\u2019s parents?\u201d\n\nDumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. \u201cHas Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother?\u201d he said.\n\nHarry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to ask Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him.\n\n\u201cYes, they were talking about Neville\u2019s parents,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHis father, Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort\u2019s whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they\u2019re dead?\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard there before. \u201cThey are insane. They are both in St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays. They do not recognize him.\u201d\n\nHarry sat there, horror-struck. He had never known . . . never, in four years, bothered to find out . . .\n\n\u201cThe Longbottoms were very popular,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThe attacks on them came after Voldemort\u2019s fall from power, just when everyone thought they were safe. Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known. The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it. Unfortunately, the Longbottoms\u2019 evidence was \u2014 given their condition \u2014 none too reliable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Mr. Crouch\u2019s son might not have been involved?\u201d said Harry slowly.\n\nDumbledore shook his head.\n\n\u201cAs to that, I have no idea.\u201d\n\nHarry sat in silence once more, watching the contents of the Pensieve swirl. There were two more questions he was burning to ask . . . but they concerned the guilt of living people. . . .\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d he said, \u201cMr. Bagman . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c. . . has never been accused of any Dark activity since,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts. \u201cAnd . . . er . . .\u201d\n\nBut the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him. Snape\u2019s face was swimming on the surface again. Dumbledore glanced down into it, and then up at Harry.\n\n\u201cNo more has Professor Snape,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry looked into Dumbledore\u2019s light blue eyes, and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it.\n\n\u201cWhat made you think he\u2019d really stopped supporting Voldemort, Professor?\u201d\n\nDumbledore held Harry\u2019s gaze for a few seconds, and then said, \u201cThat, Harry, is a matter between Professor Snape and myself.\u201d\n\nHarry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore did not look angry, yet there was a finality in his tone that told Harry it was time to go. He stood up, and so did Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he said as Harry reached the door. \u201cPlease do not speak about Neville\u2019s parents to anybody else. He has the right to let people know, when he is ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Professor,\u201d said Harry, turning to go.\n\n\u201cAnd \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry looked back. Dumbledore was standing over the Pensieve, his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light, looking older than ever. He stared at Harry for a moment, and then said, \u201cGood luck with the third task.\u201d"}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter31": "THE THIRD TASK\n\n\n\n\nDumbledore reckons You-Know-Who\u2019s getting stronger again as well?\u201d Ron whispered.\n\nEverything Harry had seen in the Pensieve, nearly everything Dumbledore had told and shown him afterward, he had now shared with Ron and Hermione \u2014 and, of course, with Sirius, to whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left Dumbledore\u2019s office. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night, talking it all over until Harry\u2019s mind was reeling, until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off.\n\nRon stared into the common room fire. Harry thought he saw Ron shiver slightly, even though the evening was warm.\n\n\u201cAnd he trusts Snape?\u201d Ron said. \u201cHe really trusts Snape, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was sitting with her forehead in her hands, staring at her knees. Harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a Pensieve.\n\n\u201cRita Skeeter,\u201d she muttered finally.\n\n\u201cHow can you be worrying about her now?\u201d said Ron, in utter disbelief.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worrying about her,\u201d Hermione said to her knees. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking . . . remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks? \u2018I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl.\u2019 This is what she meant, isn\u2019t it? She reported his trial, she knew he\u2019d passed information to the Death Eaters. And Winky too, remember . . . \u2018Ludo Bagman\u2019s a bad wizard.\u2019 Mr. Crouch would have been furious he got off, he would have talked about it at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but Bagman didn\u2019t pass information on purpose, did he?\u201d\n\nHermione shrugged.\n\n\u201cAnd Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?\u201d Ron said, turning back to Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut he\u2019s only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never thought of her, did we?\u201d said Ron slowly. \u201cMind you, she\u2019s definitely got giant blood, and she doesn\u2019t want to admit it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course she doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione sharply, looking up. \u201cLook what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother. Look at Fudge, jumping to conclusions about her, just because she\u2019s part giant. Who needs that sort of prejudice? I\u2019d probably say I had big bones if I knew that\u2019s what I\u2019d get for telling the truth.\u201d\n\nHermione looked at her watch. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done any practicing!\u201d she said, looking shocked. \u201cWe were going to do the Impediment Curse! We\u2019ll have to really get down to it tomorrow! Come on, Harry, you need to get some sleep.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. As Harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked over at Neville\u2019s bed. True to his word to Dumbledore, he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville\u2019s parents. As Harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you. He often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to Neville\u2019s snores, he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom. . . . He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch\u2019s son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors. . . . He understood how they had felt. . . . Then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later. . . .\n\nIt was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort. . . . He was the one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these lives. . . .\n\nRon and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which would finish on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their efforts into helping Harry prepare.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Hermione said shortly when Harry pointed this out to them and said he didn\u2019t mind practicing on his own for a while, \u201cat least we\u2019ll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts. We\u2019d never have found out about all these hexes in class.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood training for when we\u2019re all Aurors,\u201d said Ron excitedly, attempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair.\n\nThe mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again. Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week before the end of term. Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment. He felt more confident about this task than either of the others. Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead.\n\nTired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the school, Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione\u2019s that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter-jinx.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still doing really well, though,\u201d Hermione said encouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned. \u201cSome of these are bound to come in handy.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome and look at this,\u201d said Ron, who was standing by the window. He was staring down onto the grounds. \u201cWhat\u2019s Malfoy doing?\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout; both were smirking. Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.\n\n\u201cHe looks like he\u2019s using a walkie-talkie,\u201d said Harry curiously.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cI\u2019ve told you, those sorts of things don\u2019t work around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry,\u201d she added briskly, turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room, \u201clet\u2019s try that Shield Charm again.\u201d\n\nSirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else. He reminded Harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry\u2019s responsibility, nor was it within his power to influence it.\n\nIf Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to ensure your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under Dumbledore\u2019s protection, but all the same, take no risks: Concentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth drew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. For one thing, he was confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task. For another, this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous relief.\n\nBreakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the third task. The post owls appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from Sirius. It was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front, but Harry appreciated it all the same. A screech owl arrived for Hermione, carrying her morning copy of the Daily Prophet as usual. She unfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry and Ron together, staring at her.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it. He stared at the headline and said, \u201cNo way. Not today. That old cow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cRita Skeeter again?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone.\n\nBut before Harry could demand to see the paper, Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the Slytherin table.\n\n\u201cHey, Potter! Potter! How\u2019s your head? You feeling all right? Sure you\u2019re not going to go berserk on us?\u201d\n\nMalfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too. Slytherins up and down the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see Harry\u2019s reaction.\n\n\u201cLet me see it,\u201d Harry said to Ron. \u201cGive it here.\u201d\n\nVery reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper. Harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headline:\n\nHARRY POTTER\n\n\u201cDISTURBED AND DANGEROUS\u201d\n\nThe boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is unstable and possibly dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. Alarming evidence has recently come to light about Harry Potter\u2019s strange behavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the Triwizard Tournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School.\n\nPotter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly collapses at school, and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the curse with which You-Know-Who attempted to kill him). On Monday last, midway through a Divination lesson, your Daily Prophet reporter witnessed Potter storming from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying.\n\nIt is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, that Potter\u2019s brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by You-Know-Who, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his deep-seated confusion.\n\n\u201cHe might even be pretending,\u201d said one specialist. \u201cThis could be a plea for attention.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about Harry Potter that Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the Wizarding public.\n\n\u201cPotter can speak Parseltongue,\u201d reveals Draco Malfoy, a Hogwarts fourth year. \u201cThere were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he\u2019s made friends with werewolves and giants too. We think he\u2019d do anything for a bit of power.\u201d\n\nParseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than You-Know-Who himself. A member of the Dark Force Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak Parseltongue \u201cas worthy of investigation. Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers.\u201d Similarly, \u201canyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence.\u201d\n\nAlbus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Some fear that Potter might resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of which takes place this evening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGone off me a bit, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d said Harry lightly, folding up the paper.\n\nOver at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were laughing at him, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling their tongues like snakes.\n\n\u201cHow did she know your scar hurt in Divination?\u201d Ron said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she was there, there\u2019s no way she could\u2019ve heard \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe window was open,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI opened it to breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were at the top of North Tower!\u201d Hermione said. \u201cYour voice couldn\u2019t have carried all the way down to the grounds!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging!\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou tell me how she did it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut I . . . but . . .\u201d\n\nAn odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over Hermione\u2019s face. She slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Ron, frowning at her.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers through her hair again, and then held her hand up to her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible walkie-talkie. Harry and Ron stared at each other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an idea,\u201d Hermione said, gazing into space. \u201cI think I know . . . because then no one would be able to see . . . even Moody . . . and she\u2019d have been able to get onto the window ledge . . . but she\u2019s not allowed . . . she\u2019s definitely not allowed . . . I think we\u2019ve got her! Just give me two seconds in the library \u2014 just to make sure!\u201d\n\nWith that, Hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the Great Hall.\n\n\u201cOi!\u201d Ron called after her. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes! Blimey,\u201d he said, turning back to Harry, \u201cshe must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam. What\u2019re you going to do in Binns\u2019s class \u2014 read again?\u201d\n\nExempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard champion, Harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the third task.\n\n\u201cS\u2019pose so,\u201d Harry said to Ron; but just then, Professor McGonagall came walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward him.\n\n\u201cPotter, the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut the task\u2019s not till tonight!\u201d said Harry, accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front, afraid he had mistaken the time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, Potter,\u201d she said. \u201cThe champions\u2019 families are invited to watch the final task, you know. This is simply a chance for you to greet them.\u201d\n\nShe moved away. Harry gaped after her.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t expect the Dursleys to turn up, does she?\u201d he asked Ron blankly.\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry, I\u2019d better hurry, I\u2019m going to be late for Binns. See you later.\u201d\n\nHarry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great Hall. He saw Fleur Delacour get up from the Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered. Krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward. Harry stayed where he was. He really didn\u2019t want to go into the chamber. He had no family \u2014 no family who would turn up to see him risk his life, anyway. But just as he was getting up, thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side chamber opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.\n\n\u201cHarry, come on, they\u2019re waiting for you!\u201d\n\nUtterly perplexed, Harry got up. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t possibly be here, could they? He walked across the Hall and opened the door into the chamber.\n\nCedric and his parents were just inside the door. Viktor Krum was over in a corner, conversing with his dark-haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian. He had inherited his father\u2019s hooked nose. On the other side of the room, Fleur was jabbering away in French to her mother. Fleur\u2019s little sister, Gabrielle, was holding her mother\u2019s hand. She waved at Harry, who waved back, grinning. Then he saw Mrs. Weasley and Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.\n\n\u201cSurprise!\u201d Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them. \u201cThought we\u2019d come and watch you, Harry!\u201d She bent down and kissed him on the cheek.\n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d said Bill, grinning at Harry and shaking his hand. \u201cCharlie wanted to come, but he couldn\u2019t get time off. He said you were incredible against the Horntail.\u201d\n\nFleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with great interest over her mother\u2019s shoulder. Harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them.\n\n\u201cThis is really nice of you,\u201d Harry muttered to Mrs. Weasley. \u201cI thought for a moment \u2014 the Dursleys \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips. She had always refrained from criticizing the Dursleys in front of Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great being back here,\u201d said Bill, looking around the chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady\u2019s friend, winked at him from her frame). \u201cHaven\u2019t seen this place for five years. Is that picture of the mad knight still around? Sir Cadogan?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the previous year.\n\n\u201cAnd the Fat Lady?\u201d said Bill.\n\n\u201cShe was here in my time,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cShe gave me such a telling off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning?\u201d said Bill, surveying his mother with amazement.\n\nMrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.\n\n\u201cYour father and I had been for a nighttime stroll,\u201d she said. \u201cHe got caught by Apollyon Pringle \u2014 he was the caretaker in those days \u2014 your father\u2019s still got the marks.\u201d\n\n\u201cFancy giving us a tour, Harry?\u201d said Bill.\n\n\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d said Harry, and they made their way back toward the door into the Great Hall. As they passed Amos Diggory, he looked around.\n\n\u201cThere you are, are you?\u201d he said, looking Harry up and down. \u201cBet you\u2019re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric\u2019s caught you up on points, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cIgnore him,\u201d said Cedric in a low voice to Harry, frowning after his father. \u201cHe\u2019s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter\u2019s article about the Triwizard Tournament \u2014 you know, when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t bother to correct her, though, did he?\u201d said Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with Mrs. Weasley and Bill. \u201cStill . . . you\u2019ll show him, Ced. Beaten him once before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cRita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble, Amos!\u201d Mrs. Weasley said angrily. \u201cI would have thought you\u2019d know that, working at the Ministry!\u201d\n\nMr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm, and he merely shrugged and turned away.\n\nHarry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with Bill and Mrs. Weasley, showing them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang ship. Mrs. Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping Willow, which had been planted after she had left school, and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Percy?\u201d Harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses.\n\n\u201cNot good,\u201d said Bill.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very upset,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her voice and glancing around. \u201cThe Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch\u2019s disappearance quiet, but Percy\u2019s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in. They seem to think there\u2019s a chance they weren\u2019t genuinely written by him. Percy\u2019s been under a lot of strain. They\u2019re not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it.\u201d\n\nThey returned to the castle for lunch.\n\n\u201cMum \u2014 Bill!\u201d said Ron, looking stunned, as he joined the Gryffindor table. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome to watch Harry in the last task!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley brightly. \u201cI must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . okay,\u201d said Ron. \u201cCouldn\u2019t remember all the goblin rebels\u2019 names, so I invented a few. It\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty, while Mrs. Weasley looked stern, \u201cthey\u2019re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it wasn\u2019t hard.\u201d\n\nFred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too, and Harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the Burrow; he had forgotten to worry about that evening\u2019s task, and not until Hermione turned up, halfway through lunch, did he remember that she had had a brainwave about Rita Skeeter.\n\n\u201cAre you going to tell us \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHermione shook her head warningly and glanced at Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cHello, Hermione,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, much more stiffly than usual.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold expression on Mrs. Weasley\u2019s face.\n\nHarry looked between them, then said, \u201cMrs. Weasley, you didn\u2019t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione\u2019s not my girlfriend.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cNo \u2014 of course I didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nBut she became considerably warmer toward Hermione after that.\n\nHarry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle, and then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast. Ludo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had joined the staff table now. Bagman looked quite cheerful, but Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame Maxime, looked stern and was not talking. Madame Maxime was concentrating on her plate, and Harry thought her eyes looked red. Hagrid kept glancing along the table at her.\n\nThere were more courses than usual, but Harry, who was starting to feel really nervous now, didn\u2019t eat much. As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table, and silence fell.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, in five minutes\u2019 time, I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium now.\u201d\n\nHarry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were applauding him; the Weasleys and Hermione all wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the Great Hall with Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor.\n\n\u201cFeeling all right, Harry?\u201d Bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds. \u201cConfident?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d said Harry. It was sort of true; he was nervous, but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked, and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better.\n\nThey walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now completely unrecognizable. A twenty-foot-high hedge ran all the way around the edge of it. There was a gap right in front of them: the entrance to the vast maze. The passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.\n\nFive minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars were starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached Bagman and the champions. They were wearing large, red, luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who had his on the back of his moleskin vest.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze,\u201d said Professor McGonagall to the champions. \u201cIf you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued, send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come and get you, do you understand?\u201d\n\nThe champions nodded.\n\n\u201cOff you go, then!\u201d said Bagman brightly to the four patrollers.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d Hagrid whispered, and the four of them walked away in different directions, to station themselves around the maze. Bagman now pointed his wand at his throat, muttered, \u201cSonorus,\u201d and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each \u2014 Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!\u201d The cheers and applause sent birds from the Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky. \u201cIn second place, with eighty points \u2014 Mr. Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!\u201d More applause. \u201cAnd in third place \u2014 Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!\u201d\n\nHarry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and they waved back, beaming at him.\n\n\u201cSo . . . on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!\u201d said Bagman. \u201cThree \u2014 two \u2014 one \u2014\u201d\n\nHe gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the maze.\n\nThe towering hedges cast black shadows across the path, and, whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze. Harry felt almost as though he were underwater again. He pulled out his wand, muttered, \u201cLumos,\u201d and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.\n\nAfter about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They looked at each other.\n\n\u201cSee you,\u201d Harry said, and he took the left one, while Cedric took the right.\n\nHarry heard Bagman\u2019s whistle for the second time. Krum had entered the maze. Harry sped up. His chosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned right, and hurried on, holding his wand high over his head, trying to see as far ahead as possible. Still, there was nothing in sight.\n\nBagman\u2019s whistle blew in the distance for the third time. All of the champions were now inside.\n\nHarry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that he was being watched was upon him. The maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy. He reached a second fork.\n\n\u201cPoint Me,\u201d he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in his palm.\n\nThe wand spun around once and pointed toward his right, into solid hedge. That way was north, and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze. The best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible.\n\nThe path ahead was empty too, and when Harry reached a right turn and took it, he again found his way unblocked. Harry didn\u2019t know why, but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him. Surely he should have met something by now? It felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security. Then he heard movement right behind him. He held out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on the right-hand side. Cedric looked severely shaken. The sleeve of his robe was smoking.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s Blast-Ended Skrewts!\u201d he hissed. \u201cThey\u2019re enormous \u2014 I only just got away!\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and dived out of sight, along another path. Keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts, Harry hurried off again. Then, as he turned a corner, he saw . . . a dementor gliding toward him. Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him. Harry could hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to do. . . .\n\nHe summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione, raised his wand, and cried, \u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d\n\nA silver stag erupted from the end of Harry\u2019s wand and galloped toward the dementor, which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes. . . . Harry had never seen a dementor stumble.\n\n\u201cHang on!\u201d he shouted, advancing in the wake of his silver Patronus. \u201cYou\u2019re a boggart! Riddikulus!\u201d\n\nThere was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter exploded in a wisp of smoke. The silver stag faded from sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he could have used some company . . . but he moved on, quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, his wand held high once more.\n\nLeft . . . right . . . left again . . . Twice he found himself facing dead ends. He did the Four-Point Spell again and found that he was going too far east. He turned back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him.\n\nHarry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand\u2019s beam at it. This looked like some kind of enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way.\n\n\u201cReducto!\u201d he said.\n\nThe spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it intact. He supposed he should have known better; the Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What would happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth chancing it, or should he double back?\n\nHe was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence.\n\n\u201cFleur?\u201d Harry yelled.\n\nThere was silence. He stared all around him. What had happened to her? Her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead. He took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist.\n\nThe world turned upside down. Harry was hanging from the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the bottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there, terrified. It felt as though his feet were glued to the grass, which had now become the ceiling. Below him the dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly. He felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from the earth completely.\n\nThink, he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his head, think . . .\n\nBut not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky. Did he dare move his foot? He could hear the blood pounding in his ears. He had two choices \u2014 try and move, or send up red sparks, and get rescued and disqualified from the task.\n\nHe shut his eyes, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to see the view of endless space below him, and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling.\n\nImmediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground. He felt temporarily limp with shock. He took a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and hurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight.\n\nHe paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of Fleur. He was sure it had been she who had screamed. What had she met? Was she all right? There was no sign of red sparks \u2014 did that mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was she in such trouble that she couldn\u2019t reach her wand? Harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease . . . but at the same time, he couldn\u2019t help thinking, One champion down . . .\n\nThe Cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as though Fleur was no longer in the running. He\u2019d got this far, hadn\u2019t he? What if he actually managed to win? Fleetingly, and for the first time since he\u2019d found himself champion, he saw again that image of himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest of the school. . . .\n\nHe met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running into dead ends. Twice he took the same wrong turning. Finally, he found a new route and started to jog along it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls. Then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a Blast-Ended Skrewt.\n\nCedric was right \u2014 it was enormous. Ten feet long, it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything. Its long sting was curled over its back. Its thick armor glinted in the light from Harry\u2019s wand, which he pointed at it.\n\n\u201cStupefy!\u201d\n\nThe spell hit the skrewt\u2019s armor and rebounded; Harry ducked just in time, but could smell burning hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him.\n\n\u201cImpedimenta!\u201d Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt\u2019s armor again and ricocheted off; Harry staggered back a few paces and fell over. \u201cIMPEDIMENTA!\u201d\n\nThe skrewt was inches from him when it froze \u2014 he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction \u2014 the Impediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.\n\nHe took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and hit another; forcing himself to stop, heart hammering, he performed the Four-Point Spell again, backtracked, and chose a path that would take him northwest.\n\nHe had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes, when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d yelled Cedric\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat the hell d\u2019you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\nAnd then Harry heard Krum\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cCrucio!\u201d\n\nThe air was suddenly full of Cedric\u2019s yells. Horrified, Harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a way into Cedric\u2019s. When none appeared, he tried the Reductor Curse again. It wasn\u2019t very effective, but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening; he struggled through it, tearing his robes, and looking to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the ground, Krum standing over him.\n\nHarry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at Krum just as Krum looked up. Krum turned and began to run.\n\n\u201cStupefy!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\nThe spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in his tracks, fell forward, and lay motionless, facedown in the grass. Harry dashed over to Cedric, who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his hands over his face.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Harry said roughly, grabbing Cedric\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d panted Cedric. \u201cYeah . . . I don\u2019t believe it . . . he crept up behind me. . . . I heard him, I turned around, and he had his wand on me. . . .\u201d\n\nCedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry looked down at Krum.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this . . . I thought he was all right,\u201d Harry said, staring at Krum.\n\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d said Cedric.\n\n\u201cDid you hear Fleur scream earlier?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Cedric. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Krum got her too?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry slowly.\n\n\u201cShould we leave him here?\u201d Cedric muttered.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI reckon we should send up red sparks. Someone\u2019ll come and collect him . . . otherwise he\u2019ll probably be eaten by a skrewt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d deserve it,\u201d Cedric muttered, but all the same, he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking the spot where he lay.\n\nHarry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment, looking around them. Then Cedric said, \u201cWell . . . I s\u2019pose we\u2019d better go on. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cOh . . . yeah . . . right . . .\u201d\n\nIt was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been briefly united against Krum \u2014 now the fact that they were opponents came back to Harry. The two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking, then Harry turned left, and Cedric right. Cedric\u2019s footsteps soon died away.\n\nHarry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point Spell, making sure he was moving in the right direction. It was between him and Cedric now. His desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what he\u2019d just seen Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable Curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody had told them. Krum surely couldn\u2019t have wanted the Triwizard Cup that badly. . . . Harry sped up.\n\nEvery so often he hit more dead ends, but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode down a long, straight path, he saw movement once again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature, one which he had only seen in picture form, in his Monster Book of Monsters.\n\nIt was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion: great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman. She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating. She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing from side to side of the path, blocking his progress. Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.\n\n\u201cYou are very near your goal. The quickest way is past me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo . . . so will you move, please?\u201d said Harry, knowing what the answer was going to be.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, continuing to pace. \u201cNot unless you can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess \u2014 I let you pass. Answer wrongly \u2014 I attack. Remain silent \u2014 I will let you walk away from me unscathed.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach slipped several notches. It was Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him. He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the sphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I hear the riddle?\u201d\n\nThe sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of the path, and recited:\n\n\u201cFirst think of the person who lives in disguise,\n\nWho deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.\n\nNext, tell me what\u2019s always the last thing to mend,\n\nThe middle of middle and end of the end?\n\nAnd finally give me the sound often heard\n\nDuring the search for a hard-to-find word.\n\nNow string them together, and answer me this,\n\nWhich creature would you be unwilling to kiss?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry gaped at her.\n\n\u201cCould I have it again . . . more slowly?\u201d he asked tentatively.\n\nShe blinked at him, smiled, and repeated the poem.\n\n\u201cAll the clues add up to a creature I wouldn\u2019t want to kiss?\u201d Harry asked.\n\nShe merely smiled her mysterious smile. Harry took that for a \u201cyes.\u201d Harry cast his mind around. There were plenty of animals he wouldn\u2019t want to kiss; his immediate thought was a Blast-Ended Skrewt, but something told him that wasn\u2019t the answer. He\u2019d have to try and work out the clues. . . .\n\n\u201cA person in disguise,\u201d Harry muttered, staring at her, \u201cwho lies . . . er . . . that\u2019d be a \u2014 an imposter. No, that\u2019s not my guess! A \u2014 a spy? I\u2019ll come back to that . . . could you give me the next clue again, please?\u201d\n\nShe repeated the next lines of the poem.\n\n\u201c\u2018The last thing to mend,\u2019\u201d Harry repeated. \u201cEr . . . no idea . . . \u2018middle of middle\u2019 . . . could I have the last bit again?\u201d\n\nShe gave him the last four lines.\n\n\u201c\u2018The sound often heard during the search for a hard-to-find word,\u2019\u201d said Harry. \u201cEr . . . that\u2019d be . . . er . . . hang on \u2014 \u2018er\u2019! Er\u2019s a sound!\u201d\n\nThe sphinx smiled at him.\n\n\u201cSpy . . . er . . . spy . . . er . . .\u201d said Harry, pacing up and down. \u201cA creature I wouldn\u2019t want to kiss . . . a spider!\u201d\n\nThe sphinx smiled more broadly. She got up, stretched her front legs, and then moved aside for him to pass.\n\n\u201cThanks!\u201d said Harry, and, amazed at his own brilliance, he dashed forward.\n\nHe had to be close now, he had to be. . . . His wand was telling him he was bang on course; as long as he didn\u2019t meet anything too horrible, he might have a chance. . . .\n\nHarry broke into a run. He had a choice of paths up ahead. \u201cPoint Me!\u201d he whispered again to his wand, and it spun around and pointed him to the right-hand one. He dashed up this one and saw light ahead.\n\nThe Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away. Suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him.\n\nCedric was going to get there first. Cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was much taller, had much longer legs \u2014\n\nThen Harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left, moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had not seen it \u2014\n\n\u201cCedric!\u201d Harry bellowed. \u201cOn your left!\u201d\n\nCedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it, but in his haste, he tripped. Harry saw Cedric\u2019s wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon Cedric.\n\n\u201cStupefy!\u201d Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider\u2019s gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did, he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider jerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.\n\n\u201cStupefy! Impedimenta! Stupefy!\u201d\n\nBut it was no use \u2014 the spider was either so large, or so magical, that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it. Harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and razor-sharp pincers before it was upon him.\n\nHe was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling madly, he tried to kick it; his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain. He could hear Cedric yelling \u201cStupefy!\u201d too, but his spell had no more effect than Harry\u2019s \u2014 Harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d\n\nIt worked \u2014 the Disarming Spell made the spider drop him, but that meant that Harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath him. Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the spider\u2019s underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted \u201cStupefy!\u201d just as Cedric yelled the same thing.\n\nThe two spells combined did what one alone had not: The spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d he heard Cedric shouting. \u201cYou all right? Did it fall on you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry called back, panting. He looked down at his leg. It was bleeding freely. He could see some sort of thick, gluey secretion from the spider\u2019s pincers on his torn robes. He tried to get up, but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight. He leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath, and looked around.\n\nCedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup, which was gleaming behind him.\n\n\u201cTake it, then,\u201d Harry panted to Cedric. \u201cGo on, take it. You\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nBut Cedric didn\u2019t move. He merely stood there, looking at Harry. Then he turned to stare at the cup. Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light. Cedric looked around at Harry again, who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself. Cedric took a deep breath.\n\n\u201cYou take it. You should win. That\u2019s twice you\u2019ve saved my neck in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to work,\u201d Harry said. He felt angry; his leg was very painful, he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all his efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he\u2019d beaten Harry to ask Cho to the ball. \u201cThe one who reaches the cup first gets the points. That\u2019s you. I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m not going to win any races on this leg.\u201d\n\nCedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider, away from the cup, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cStop being noble,\u201d said Harry irritably. \u201cJust take it, then we can get out of here.\u201d\n\nCedric watched Harry steadying himself, holding tight to the hedge.\n\n\u201cYou told me about the dragons,\u201d Cedric said. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone down in the first task if you hadn\u2019t told me what was coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had help on that too,\u201d Harry snapped, trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes. \u201cYou helped me with the egg \u2014 we\u2019re square.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had help on the egg in the first place,\u201d said Cedric.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still square,\u201d said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook violently as he put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him.\n\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve got more points on the second task,\u201d said Cedric mulishly. \u201cYou stayed behind to get all the hostages. I should\u2019ve done that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!\u201d said Harry bitterly. \u201cJust take the cup!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Cedric.\n\nHe stepped over the spider\u2019s tangled legs to join Harry, who stared at him. Cedric was serious. He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House hadn\u2019t had in centuries.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Cedric said. He looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed decided.\n\nHarry looked from Cedric to the cup. For one shining moment, he saw himself emerging from the maze, holding it. He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho\u2019s face shining with admiration, more clearly than he had ever seen it before . . . and then the picture faded, and he found himself staring at Cedric\u2019s shadowy, stubborn face.\n\n\u201cBoth of us,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take it at the same time. It\u2019s still a Hogwarts victory. We\u2019ll tie for it.\u201d\n\nCedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms.\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYeah . . . we\u2019ve helped each other out, haven\u2019t we? We both got here. Let\u2019s just take it together.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn\u2019t believe his ears; then his face split in a grin.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on,\u201d he said. \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\nHe grabbed Harry\u2019s arm below the shoulder and helped Harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood. When they had reached it, they both held a hand out over one of the cup\u2019s gleaming handles.\n\n\u201cOn three, right?\u201d said Harry. \u201cOne \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014\u201d\n\nHe and Cedric both grasped a handle.\n\nInstantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel. His feet had left the ground. He could not unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color, Cedric at his side."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter32": "FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE\n\n\n\n\nHarry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured leg gave way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he said.\n\nCedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and they looked around.\n\nThey had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they had obviously traveled miles \u2014 perhaps hundreds of miles \u2014 for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillside.\n\nCedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up at Harry.\n\n\u201cDid anyone tell you the Cup was a Portkey?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It was completely silent and slightly eerie. \u201cIs this supposed to be part of the task?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous. \u201cWands out, d\u2019you reckon?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the suggestion rather than him.\n\nThey pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. He had, yet again, the strange feeling that they were being watched.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d he said suddenly.\n\nSquinting tensely through the darkness, they watched the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward them between the graves. Harry couldn\u2019t make out a face, but from the way it was walking and holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And \u2014 several paces nearer, the gap between them closing all the time \u2014 Harry saw that the thing in the person\u2019s arms looked like a baby . . . or was it merely a bundle of robes?\n\nHarry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at Cedric. Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both turned back to watch the approaching figure.\n\nIt stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only six feet from them. For a second, Harry and Cedric and the short figure simply looked at one another.\n\nAnd then, without warning, Harry\u2019s scar exploded with pain. It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open.\n\nFrom far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold voice say, \u201cKill the spare.\u201d\n\nA swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched the words to the night: \u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d\n\nA blast of green light blazed through Harry\u2019s eyelids, and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of what he was about to see, he opened his stinging eyes.\n\nCedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.\n\nFor a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared into Cedric\u2019s face, at his open gray eyes, blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised. And then, before Harry\u2019s mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.\n\nThe short man in the cloak had put down his bundle, lit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against it.\n\nTOM RIDDLE\n\n\n\nThe cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around Harry, tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing from the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man hit him \u2014 hit him with a hand that had a finger missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood. It was Wormtail.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d he gasped.\n\nBut Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes, did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, fumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn\u2019t move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry\u2019s mouth; then, without a word, he turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn\u2019t make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had gone; he couldn\u2019t turn his head to see beyond the headstone; he could see only what was right in front of him.\n\nCedric\u2019s body was lying some twenty feet away. Some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry\u2019s wand was on the ground at Cedric\u2019s feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again . . . and he suddenly knew that he didn\u2019t want to see what was in those robes . . . he didn\u2019t want that bundle opened. . . .\n\nHe could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass, circling the headstone where he was tied. Wormtail\u2019s fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground. Then he came back within Harry\u2019s range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what seemed to be water \u2014 Harry could hear it slopping around \u2014 and it was larger than any cauldron Harry had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a full-grown man to sit in.\n\nThe thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently, as though it was trying to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly there were crackling flames beneath it. The large snake slithered away into the darkness.\n\nThe liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface began not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending the fire. The movements beneath the robes became more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice again.\n\n\u201cHurry!\u201d\n\nThe whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now. It might have been encrusted with diamonds.\n\n\u201cIt is ready, Master.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow . . .\u201d said the cold voice.\n\nWormtail pulled open the robes on the ground, revealing what was inside them, and Harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouth.\n\nIt was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind \u2014 but worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child, except that Harry had never seen anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly-looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs were thin and feeble, and its face \u2014 no child alive ever had a face like that \u2014 flat and snakelike, with gleaming red eyes.\n\nThe thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin arms, put them around Wormtail\u2019s neck, and Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back, and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail\u2019s weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron. For one moment, Harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion. And then Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron; there was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface; Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thud.\n\nLet it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost past endurance, please . . . let it drown. . . .\n\nWormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed frightened beyond his wits. He raised his wand, closed his eyes, and spoke to the night.\n\n\u201cBone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!\u201d\n\nThe surface of the grave at Harry\u2019s feet cracked. Horrified, Harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail\u2019s command and fell softly into the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions and turned a vivid, poisonous-looking blue.\n\nAnd now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long, thin, shining silver dagger from inside his cloak. His voice broke into petrified sobs.\n\n\u201cFlesh \u2014 of the servant \u2014 w-willingly given \u2014 you will \u2014 revive \u2014 your master.\u201d\n\nHe stretched his right hand out in front of him \u2014 the hand with the missing finger. He gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward.\n\nHarry realized what Wormtail was about to do a second before it happened \u2014 he closed his eyes as tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream that pierced the night, that went through Harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. He heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail\u2019s anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as something was dropped into the cauldron. Harry couldn\u2019t stand to look . . . but the potion had turned a burning red; the light of it shone through Harry\u2019s closed eyelids. . . .\n\nWormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not until Harry felt Wormtail\u2019s anguished breath on his face did he realize that Wormtail was right in front of him.\n\n\u201cB-blood of the enemy . . . forcibly taken . . . you will . . . resurrect your foe.\u201d\n\nHarry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too tightly. . . . Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in Wormtail\u2019s remaining hand. He felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes. Wormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry\u2019s cut, so that a dribble of blood fell into it.\n\nHe staggered back to the cauldron with Harry\u2019s blood. He poured it inside. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done, dropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then slumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing.\n\nThe cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. Nothing happened. . . .\n\nLet it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone wrong. . . .\n\nAnd then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead, obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he couldn\u2019t see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air. . . . It\u2019s gone wrong, he thought . . . it\u2019s drowned . . . please . . . please let it be dead. . . .\n\nBut then, through the mist in front of him, he saw, with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man, tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the cauldron.\n\n\u201cRobe me,\u201d said the high, cold voice from behind the steam, and Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached up, and pulled them one-handed over his master\u2019s head.\n\nThe thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry . . . and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snake\u2019s with slits for nostrils . . .\n\nLord Voldemort had risen again."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter33": "THE DEATH EATERS\n\n\n\n\nVoldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cat\u2019s, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.\n\nWormtail\u2019s robes were shining with blood now; he had wrapped the stump of his arm in them.\n\n\u201cMy Lord . . .\u201d he choked, \u201cmy Lord . . . you promised . . . you did promise . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHold out your arm,\u201d said Voldemort lazily.\n\n\u201cOh Master . . . thank you, Master . . .\u201d\n\nHe extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort laughed again.\n\n\u201cThe other arm, Wormtail.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, please . . . please . . .\u201d\n\nVoldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail\u2019s left arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail\u2019s robes up past his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin there, something like a vivid red tattoo \u2014 a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth \u2014 the image that had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup: the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully, ignoring Wormtail\u2019s uncontrollable weeping.\n\n\u201cIt is back,\u201d he said softly, \u201cthey will all have noticed it . . . and now, we shall see . . . now we shall know . . .\u201d\n\nHe pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on Wormtail\u2019s arm.\n\nThe scar on Harry\u2019s forehead seared with a sharp pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl; Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail\u2019s mark, and Harry saw that it had turned jet black.\n\nA look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard.\n\n\u201cHow many will be brave enough to return when they feel it?\u201d he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars. \u201cAnd how many will be foolish enough to stay away?\u201d\n\nHe began to pace up and down before Harry and Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while. After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again, a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face.\n\n\u201cYou stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,\u201d he hissed softly. \u201cA Muggle and a fool . . . very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death. . . .\u201d\n\nVoldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass.\n\n\u201cYou see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was. . . . He didn\u2019t like magic, my father . . .\n\n\u201cHe left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage . . . but I vowed to find him . . . I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle. . . .\u201d\n\nStill he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave.\n\n\u201cListen to me, reliving family history . . .\u201d he said quietly, \u201cwhy, I am growing quite sentimental. . . . But look, Harry! My true family returns. . . .\u201d\n\nThe air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks. Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could hardly believe their eyes. Voldemort stood in silence, waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the hem of his black robes.\n\n\u201cMaster . . . Master . . .\u201d he murmured.\n\nThe Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes, before backing away and standing up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom Riddle\u2019s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He looked around at the hooded faces, and though there was no wind, a rustling seemed to run around the circle, as though it had shivered.\n\n\u201cWelcome, Death Eaters,\u201d said Voldemort quietly. \u201cThirteen years . . . thirteen years since last we met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday. . . . We are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or are we?\u201d\n\nHe put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like nostrils widening.\n\n\u201cI smell guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a stench of guilt upon the air.\u201d\n\nA second shiver ran around the circle, as though each member of it longed, but did not dare, to step back from him.\n\n\u201cI see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers intact \u2014 such prompt appearances! \u2014 and I ask myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal loyalty?\u201d\n\nNo one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding arm.\n\n\u201cAnd I answer myself,\u201d whispered Voldemort, \u201cthey must have believed me broken, they thought I was gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment. . . .\n\n\u201cAnd then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living?\n\n\u201cAnd I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist, one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort . . . perhaps they now pay allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus Dumbledore?\u201d\n\nAt the mention of Dumbledore\u2019s name, the members of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook their heads. Voldemort ignored them.\n\n\u201cIt is a disappointment to me . . . I confess myself disappointed. . . .\u201d\n\nOne of the men suddenly flung himself forward, breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he collapsed at Voldemort\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cMaster!\u201d he shrieked, \u201cMaster, forgive me! Forgive us all!\u201d\n\nVoldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.\n\n\u201cCrucio!\u201d\n\nThe Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. . . . Let the police come, he thought desperately . . . anyone . . . anything . . .\n\nVoldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping.\n\n\u201cGet up, Avery,\u201d said Voldemort softly. \u201cStand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years . . . I want thirteen years\u2019 repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, have you not, Wormtail?\u201d\n\nHe looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.\n\n\u201cYou returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Master,\u201d moaned Wormtail, \u201cplease, Master . . . please . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYet you helped return me to my body,\u201d said Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the ground. \u201cWorthless and traitorous as you are, you helped me . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers. . . .\u201d\n\nVoldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air. A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand\u2019s wake. Momentarily shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail\u2019s bleeding wrist.\n\nWormtail\u2019s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder.\n\n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMaster . . . it is beautiful . . . thank you . . . thank you. . . . \u201d\n\nHe scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cMay your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,\u201d said Voldemort.\n\n\u201cNo, my Lord . . . never, my Lord . . .\u201d\n\nWormtail stood up and took his place in the circle, staring at his powerful new hand, his face still shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cLucius, my slippery friend,\u201d he whispered, halting before him. \u201cI am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried to find me, Lucius. . . . Your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup were fun, I daresay . . . but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord, I was constantly on the alert,\u201d came Lucius Malfoy\u2019s voice swiftly from beneath the hood. \u201cHad there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?\u201d said Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly. \u201cYes, I know all about that, Lucius. . . . You have disappointed me. . . . I expect more faithful service in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, my Lord, of course. . . . You are merciful, thank you. . . .\u201d\n\nVoldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space \u2014 large enough for two people \u2014 that separated Malfoy and the next man.\n\n\u201cThe Lestranges should stand here,\u201d said Voldemort quietly. \u201cBut they are entombed in Azkaban. They were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me. . . . When Azkaban is broken open, the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The dementors will join us . . . they are our natural allies . . . we will recall the banished giants . . . I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of creatures whom all fear. . . .\u201d\n\nHe walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence, but he paused before others and spoke to them.\n\n\u201cMacnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord Voldemort will provide. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Master . . . thank you,\u201d murmured Macnair.\n\n\u201cAnd here\u201d \u2014 Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures \u2014 \u201cwe have Crabbe . . . you will do better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you, Goyle?\u201d\n\nThey bowed clumsily, muttering dully.\n\n\u201cYes, Master . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will, Master. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same goes for you, Nott,\u201d said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyle\u2019s shadow.\n\n\u201cMy Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your most faithful \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Voldemort.\n\nHe had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he could see people standing there.\n\n\u201cAnd here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return . . . he will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever . . . he will be killed, of course . . . and one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.\u201d\n\nThe Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks.\n\n\u201cHe is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight. . . .\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry\u2019s direction. \u201cHarry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor.\u201d\n\nThere was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy\u2019s voice spoke from under the mask.\n\n\u201cMaster, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . . how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how you managed to return to us. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, what a story it is, Lucius,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cAnd it begins \u2014 and ends \u2014 with my young friend here.\u201d\n\nHe walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them. The snake continued to circle.\n\n\u201cYou know, of course, that they have called this boy my downfall?\u201d Voldemort said softly, his red eyes upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony. \u201cYou all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill him. His mother died in the attempt to save him \u2014 and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen. . . . I could not touch the boy.\u201d\n\nVoldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to Harry\u2019s cheek.\n\n\u201cHis mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it . . . but no matter. I can touch him now.\u201d\n\nHarry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him, and thought his head would burst with the pain. Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the finger away and continued addressing the Death Eaters.\n\n\u201cI miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was deflected by the woman\u2019s foolish sacrifice, and it rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain, my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive. What I was, even I do not know . . . I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality. You know my goal \u2014 to conquer death. And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked . . . for I had not been killed, though the curse should have done it. Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive, and without the means to help myself . . . for I had no body, and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand. . . .\n\n\u201cI remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist. . . . I settled in a faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. . . . Surely, one of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me . . . one of them would come and perform the magic I could not, to restore me to a body . . . but I waited in vain. . . .\u201d\n\nThe shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing.\n\n\u201cOnly one power remained to me. I could possess the bodies of others. But I dared not go where other humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes inhabited animals \u2014 snakes, of course, being my preference \u2014 but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic . . . and my possession of them shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. . . .\n\n\u201cThen . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return seemed assured. A wizard \u2014 young, foolish, and gullible \u2014 wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of . . . for he was a teacher at Dumbledore\u2019s school . . . he was easy to bend to my will . . . he brought me back to this country, and after a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. I was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted . . . thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. . . .\u201d\n\nSilence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.\n\n\u201cThe servant died when I left his body, and I was left as weak as ever I had been,\u201d Voldemort continued. \u201cI returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not pretend to you that I didn\u2019t then fear that I might never regain my powers. . . . Yes, that was perhaps my darkest hour . . . I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess . . . and I had given up hope, now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me. . . .\u201d\n\nOne or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice.\n\n\u201cAnd then, not even a year ago, when I had almost abandoned hope, it happened at last . . . a servant returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends, and decided to return to his master. He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . . helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way. Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not, Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided, where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. . . .\n\n\u201cBut his journey back to me was not smooth, was it, Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me, he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a witch from the Ministry of Magic.\n\n\u201cNow see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort. This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail \u2014 displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him \u2014 convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her . . . he brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams . . . for \u2014 with a little persuasion \u2014 she became a veritable mine of information.\n\n\u201cShe told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She told me many things . . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and when I had extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair. She had now served her purpose. I could not possess her. I disposed of her.\u201d\n\nVoldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes blank and pitiless.\n\n\u201cWormtail\u2019s body, of course, was ill adapted for possession, as all assumed him dead, and would attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he was the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the instructions I gave him, which would return me to a rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth . . . a spell or two of my own invention . . . a little help from my dear Nagini,\u201d Voldemort\u2019s red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake, \u201ca potion concocted from unicorn blood, and the snake venom Nagini provided . . . I was soon returned to an almost human form, and strong enough to travel.\n\n\u201cThere was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality. I set my sights lower . . . I would settle for my old body back again, and my old strength.\n\n\u201cI knew that to achieve this \u2014 it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight \u2014 I would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail? Flesh given by a servant. . . .\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s bone, naturally, meant that we would have to come here, where he was buried. But the blood of a foe . . . Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me . . . as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potter\u2019s blood. I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . . .\n\n\u201cBut how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been better protected than I think even he knows, protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago, when it fell to him to arrange the boy\u2019s future. Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the boy\u2019s protection as long as he is in his relations\u2019 care. Not even I can touch him there. . . . Then, of course, there was the Quidditch World Cup. . . . I thought his protection might be weaker there, away from his relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that Muggle-loving fool from morning until night. So how could I take him?\n\n\u201cWhy . . . by using Bertha Jorkins\u2019s information, of course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy\u2019s name was entered into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament \u2014 that he touched the Triwizard Cup first \u2014 the Cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore\u2019s help and protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is . . . the boy you all believed had been my downfall. . . .\u201d\n\nVoldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face Harry. He raised his wand.\n\n\u201cCrucio!\u201d\n\nIt was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end . . . to black out . . . to die . . .\n\nAnd then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort\u2019s father, looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound of the Death Eaters\u2019 laughter.\n\n\u201cYou see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me,\u201d said Voldemort. \u201cBut I want there to be no mistake in anybody\u2019s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance. And I am now going to prove my power by killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer, Nagini,\u201d he whispered, and the snake glided away through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood watching.\n\n\u201cNow untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his wand.\u201d"}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter34": "PRIORI INCANTATEM\n\n\n\n\nWormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own weight before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying Harry to the gravestone.\n\nThere was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric\u2019s body lay and returned with Harry\u2019s wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry\u2019s hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.\n\n\u201cYou have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?\u201d said Voldemort softly, his red eyes glinting through the darkness.\n\nAt these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago. . . . All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, \u201cExpelliarmus\u201d . . . and what use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned . . . the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse \u2014 and Voldemort was right \u2014 his mother was not here to die for him this time. . . . He was quite unprotected. . . .\n\n\u201cWe bow to each other, Harry,\u201d said Voldemort, bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face upturned to Harry. \u201cCome, the niceties must be observed. . . . Dumbledore would like you to show manners. . . . Bow to death, Harry. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemort\u2019s lipless mouth was smiling. Harry did not bow. He was not going to let Voldemort play with him before killing him . . . he was not going to give him that satisfaction. . . .\n\n\u201cI said, bow,\u201d Voldemort said, raising his wand \u2014 and Harry felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too. \u201cAnd now you face me, like a man . . . straight-backed and proud, the way your father died. . . .\n\n\u201cAnd now \u2014 we duel.\u201d\n\nVoldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do anything to defend himself, before he could even move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse. The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew where he was. . . . White-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he\u2019d ever screamed in his life \u2014\n\nAnd then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet; he was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off; he staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters, and they pushed him away, back toward Voldemort.\n\n\u201cA little break,\u201d said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils dilating with excitement, \u201ca little pause . . . That hurt, didn\u2019t it, Harry? You don\u2019t want me to do that again, do you?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t answer. He was going to die like Cedric, those pitiless red eyes were telling him so . . . he was going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it . . . but he wasn\u2019t going to play along. He wasn\u2019t going to obey Voldemort . . . he wasn\u2019t going to beg. . . .\n\n\u201cI asked you whether you want me to do that again,\u201d said Voldemort softly. \u201cAnswer me! Imperio!\u201d\n\nAnd Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all thought. . . . Ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as though he were floating, dreaming . . . just answer no . . . say no . . . just answer no. . . .\n\nI will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won\u2019t answer. . . .\n\nJust answer no. . . .\n\nI won\u2019t do it, I won\u2019t say it. . . .\n\nJust answer no. . . .\n\n\u201cI WON\u2019T!\u201d\n\nAnd these words burst from Harry\u2019s mouth; they echoed through the graveyard, and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him \u2014 back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body \u2014 back rushed the realization of where he was, and what he was facing. . . .\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d said Voldemort quietly, and the Death Eaters were not laughing now. \u201cYou won\u2019t say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die. . . . Perhaps another little dose of pain?\u201d\n\nVoldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort\u2019s father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed him.\n\n\u201cWe are not playing hide-and-seek, Harry,\u201d said Voldemort\u2019s soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the Death Eaters laughed. \u201cYou cannot hide from me. Does this mean you are tired of our duel? Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now, Harry? Come out, Harry . . . come out and play, then . . . it will be quick . . . it might even be painless . . . I would not know . . . I have never died. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come. There was no hope . . . no help to be had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort\u2019s feet . . . he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. . . .\n\nBefore Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone, Harry stood up . . . he gripped his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing Voldemort.\n\nVoldemort was ready. As Harry shouted, \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d Voldemort cried, \u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d\n\nA jet of green light issued from Voldemort\u2019s wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry\u2019s \u2014 they met in midair \u2014 and suddenly Harry\u2019s wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it; his hand seized up around it; he couldn\u2019t have released it if he\u2019d wanted to \u2014 and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands, neither red nor green, but bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort\u2019s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating.\n\nAnd then \u2014 nothing could have prepared Harry for this \u2014 he felt his feet lift from the ground. He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light. They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort\u2019s father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves. . . . The Death Eaters were shouting; they were asking Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in, reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing their wands \u2014\n\nThe golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the wands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden, dome-shaped web, a cage of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals, their cries strangely muffled now. . . .\n\n\u201cDo nothing!\u201d Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening, saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry\u2019s; Harry held onto his wand more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken. \u201cDo nothing unless I command you!\u201d Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters.\n\nAnd then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air. . . . It was coming from every thread of the light-spun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort. It was a sound Harry recognized, though he had heard it only once before in his life: phoenix song.\n\nIt was the sound of hope to Harry . . . the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life. . . . He felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around him. . . . It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore, and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . .\n\nDon\u2019t break the connection.\n\nI know, Harry told the music, I know I mustn\u2019t . . . but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed too . . . it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands \u2014 Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way. . . . The direction of the beam\u2019s movement was now toward him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily. . . .\n\nAs the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harry\u2019s wand-tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry\u2019s wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers \u2014\n\nHe concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed . . . and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way . . . and it was Voldemort\u2019s wand that was vibrating extra-hard now . . . Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful. . . .\n\nOne of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort\u2019s wand. Harry didn\u2019t understand why he was doing it, didn\u2019t know what it might achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort\u2019s wand . . . and slowly . . . very slowly . . . it moved along the golden thread . . . it trembled for a moment . . . and then it connected. . . .\n\nAt once, Voldemort\u2019s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain . . . then \u2014 Voldemort\u2019s red eyes widened with shock \u2014 a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail . . . more shouts of pain . . . and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemort\u2019s wand-tip, a great, grayish something, that looked as though it were made of the solidest, densest smoke. . . . It was a head . . . now a chest and arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory.\n\nIf ever Harry might have released his wand from shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken, even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? it looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort\u2019s wand, as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel . . . and this shade of Cedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden thread of light, and spoke.\n\n\u201cHold on, Harry,\u201d it said.\n\nIts voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort . . . his wide red eyes were still shocked . . . he had no more expected this than Harry had . . . and, very dimly, Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of the golden dome. . . .\n\nMore screams of pain from the wand . . . and then something else emerged from its tip . . . the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso . . . an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done . . . and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric\u2019s, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick. . . .\n\n\u201cHe was a real wizard, then?\u201d the old man said, his eyes on Voldemort. \u201cKilled me, that one did. . . . You fight him, boy. . . .\u201d\n\nBut already, yet another head was emerging . . . and this head, gray as a smoky statue, was a woman\u2019s. . . . Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others, staring. . . .\n\nThe shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let go, now!\u201d she cried, and her voice echoed like Cedric\u2019s as though from very far away. \u201cDon\u2019t let him get you, Harry \u2014 don\u2019t let go!\u201d\n\nShe and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web, while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it . . . and Voldemort\u2019s dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn\u2019t hear to Voldemort.\n\nAnd now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemort\u2019s wand . . . and Harry knew when he saw it who it would be . . . he knew, as though he had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand . . . knew, because the woman appearing was the one he\u2019d thought of more than any other tonight. . . .\n\nThe smoky shadow of a young woman with long hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened up, and looked at him . . . and Harry, his arms shaking madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his mother.\n\n\u201cYour father\u2019s coming. . . .\u201d she said quietly. \u201cHold on for your father. . . . It will be all right. . . . Hold on. . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he came . . . first his head, then his body . . . tall and untidy-haired like Harry, the smoky, shadowy form of James Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort\u2019s wand, fell to the ground, and straightened like his wife. He walked close to Harry, looking down at him, and he spoke in the same distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him, could not hear. . . .\n\n\u201cWhen the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments . . . but we will give you time . . . you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts . . . do you understand, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers.\n\n\u201cHarry . . .\u201d whispered the figure of Cedric, \u201ctake my body back, will you? Take my body back to my parents. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand.\n\n\u201cDo it now,\u201d whispered his father\u2019s voice, \u201cbe ready to run . . . do it now. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNOW!\u201d Harry yelled; he didn\u2019t think he could have held on for another moment anyway \u2014 he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the phoenix song died \u2014 but the shadowy figures of Voldemort\u2019s victims did not disappear \u2014 they were closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his gaze \u2014\n\nAnd Harry ran as he had never run in his life, knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their curses following him, hearing them hit the headstones \u2014 he was dodging curses and graves, pelting toward Cedric\u2019s body, no longer aware of the pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what he had to do \u2014\n\n\u201cStun him!\u201d he heard Voldemort scream.\n\nTen feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel \u2014\n\n\u201cImpedimenta!\u201d he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him.\n\nFrom a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at least one of them, but there was no time to stop and look; he jumped over the Cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to grab Cedric\u2019s arm \u2014\n\n\u201cStand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!\u201d shrieked Voldemort.\n\nHarry\u2019s hand had closed on Cedric\u2019s wrist; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the Cup was out of reach \u2014\n\nVoldemort\u2019s red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry saw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his wand.\n\n\u201cAccio!\u201d Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup.\n\nIt flew into the air and soared toward him. Harry caught it by the handle \u2014\n\nHe heard Voldemort\u2019s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked \u2014 it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along with him. . . . They were going back."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter35": "VERITASERUM\n\n\n\n\nHarry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his nostrils. He had closed his eyes while the Portkey transported him, and he kept them closed now. He did not move. All the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship. To hold himself steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Triwizard Cup and Cedric\u2019s body. He felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them. Shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in the smell of the grass, waiting . . . waiting for someone to do something . . . something to happen . . . and all the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. . . .\n\nA torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there were voices everywhere, footsteps, screams. . . . He remained where he was, his face screwed up against the noise, as though it were a nightmare that would pass. . . .\n\nThen a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him over.\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry!\u201d\n\nHe opened his eyes.\n\nHe was looking up at the starry sky, and Albus Dumbledore was crouched over him. The dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them, pushing nearer; Harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footsteps.\n\nHe had come back to the edge of the maze. He could see the stands rising above him, the shapes of people moving in them, the stars above.\n\nHarry let go of the Cup, but he clutched Cedric to him even more tightly. He raised his free hand and seized Dumbledore\u2019s wrist, while Dumbledore\u2019s face swam in and out of focus.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s back,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s back. Voldemort.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happened?\u201d\n\nThe face of Cornelius Fudge appeared upside down over Harry; it looked white, appalled.\n\n\u201cMy God \u2014 Diggory!\u201d it whispered. \u201cDumbledore \u2014 he\u2019s dead!\u201d\n\nThe words were repeated, the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around them . . . and then others shouted it \u2014 screeched it \u2014 into the night \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s dead!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s dead!\u201d \u201cCedric Diggory! Dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, let go of him,\u201d he heard Fudge\u2019s voice say, and he felt fingers trying to pry him from Cedric\u2019s limp body, but Harry wouldn\u2019t let him go. Then Dumbledore\u2019s face, which was still blurred and misted, came closer.\n\n\u201cHarry, you can\u2019t help him now. It\u2019s over. Let go.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted me to bring him back,\u201d Harry muttered \u2014 it seemed important to explain this. \u201cHe wanted me to bring him back to his parents. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Harry . . . just let go now. . . .\u201d\n\nDumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin, raised Harry from the ground and set him on his feet. Harry swayed. His head was pounding. His injured leg would no longer support his weight. The crowd around them jostled, fighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on him \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d \u201cDiggory\u2019s dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll need to go to the hospital wing!\u201d Fudge was saying loudly. \u201cHe\u2019s ill, he\u2019s injured \u2014 Dumbledore, Diggory\u2019s parents, they\u2019re here, they\u2019re in the stands. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take Harry, Dumbledore, I\u2019ll take him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I would prefer \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore, Amos Diggory\u2019s running . . . he\u2019s coming over. . . . Don\u2019t you think you should tell him \u2014 before he sees \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, stay here \u2014\u201d\n\nGirls were screaming, sobbing hysterically. . . . The scene flickered oddly before Harry\u2019s eyes. . . .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, son, I\u2019ve got you . . . come on . . . hospital wing . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore said stay,\u201d said Harry thickly, the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse than ever.\n\n\u201cYou need to lie down. . . . Come on now. . . .\u201d\n\nSomeone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling, half carrying him through the frightened crowd. Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them, taking him back to the castle. Across the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship, Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walk.\n\n\u201cWhat happened, Harry?\u201d the man asked at last as he lifted Harry up the stone steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. It was Mad-Eye Moody.\n\n\u201cCup was a Portkey,\u201d said Harry as they crossed the entrance hall. \u201cTook me and Cedric to a graveyard . . . and Voldemort was there . . . Lord Voldemort . . .\u201d\n\nClunk. Clunk. Clunk. Up the marble stairs . . .\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord was there? What happened then?\u201d\n\n\u201cKilled Cedric . . . they killed Cedric. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\nClunk. Clunk. Clunk. Along the corridor . . .\n\n\u201cMade a potion . . . got his body back. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord got his body back? He\u2019s returned?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Death Eaters came . . . and then we dueled. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dueled with the Dark Lord?\u201d\n\n\u201cGot away . . . my wand . . . did something funny. . . . I saw my mum and dad . . . they came out of his wand. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIn here, Harry . . . in here, and sit down. . . . You\u2019ll be all right now . . . drink this. . . .\u201d\n\nHarry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his hands.\n\n\u201cDrink it . . . you\u2019ll feel better . . . come on, now, Harry, I need to know exactly what happened. . . .\u201d\n\nMoody helped tip the stuff down Harry\u2019s throat; he coughed, a peppery taste burning his throat. Moody\u2019s office came into sharper focus, and so did Moody himself. . . . He looked as white as Fudge had looked, and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cVoldemort\u2019s back, Harry? You\u2019re sure he\u2019s back? How did he do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe took stuff from his father\u2019s grave, and from Wormtail, and me,\u201d said Harry. His head felt clearer; his scar wasn\u2019t hurting so badly; he could now see Moody\u2019s face distinctly, even though the office was dark. He could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant Quidditch field.\n\n\u201cWhat did the Dark Lord take from you?\u201d said Moody.\n\n\u201cBlood,\u201d said Harry, raising his arm. His sleeve was ripped where Wormtail\u2019s dagger had torn it.\n\nMoody let out his breath in a long, low hiss.\n\n\u201cAnd the Death Eaters? They returned?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLoads of them . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he treat them?\u201d Moody asked quietly. \u201cDid he forgive them?\u201d\n\nBut Harry had suddenly remembered. He should have told Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway \u2014\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There\u2019s a Death Eater here \u2014 they put my name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back down.\n\n\u201cI know who the Death Eater is,\u201d he said quietly.\n\n\u201cKarkaroff?\u201d said Harry wildly. \u201cWhere is he? Have you got him? Is he locked up?\u201d\n\n\u201cKarkaroff?\u201d said Moody with an odd laugh. \u201cKarkaroff fled tonight, when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm. He betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . . but I doubt he will get far. The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cKarkaroff\u2019s gone? He ran away? But then \u2014 he didn\u2019t put my name in the goblet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Moody slowly. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. It was I who did that.\u201d\n\nHarry heard, but didn\u2019t believe.\n\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do that . . . you can\u2019t have done . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you I did,\u201d said Moody, and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door, and Harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside it. At the same time, Moody drew out his wand and pointed it at Harry.\n\n\u201cHe forgave them, then?\u201d he said. \u201cThe Death Eaters who went free? The ones who escaped Azkaban?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at him. This was a bad joke, it had to be.\n\n\u201cI asked you,\u201d said Moody quietly, \u201cwhether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him. Those treacherous cowards who wouldn\u2019t even brave Azkaban for him. The faithless, worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fired . . . What are you talking about . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, Harry . . . I told you. If there\u2019s one thing I hate more than any other, it\u2019s a Death Eater who walked free. They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most. I expected him to punish them. I expected him to torture them. Tell me he hurt them, Harry. . . .\u201d Moody\u2019s face was suddenly lit with an insane smile. \u201cTell me he told them that I, I alone remained faithful . . . prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all . . . you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t . . . it \u2014 it can\u2019t be you. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWho put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the name of a different school? I did. Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament? I did. Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons? I did. Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon? I did.\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s magical eye had now left the door. It was fixed upon Harry. His lopsided mouth leered more widely than ever.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy, Harry, guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion. I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess, so that my hand would not be detectable in your success. Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily. As long as you got into that maze, preferably with a decent head start \u2014 then, I knew, I would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear. But I also had to contend with your stupidity. The second task . . . that was when I was most afraid we would fail. I was keeping watch on you, Potter. I knew you hadn\u2019t worked out the egg\u2019s clue, so I had to give you another hint \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Harry said hoarsely. \u201cCedric gave me the clue \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told Cedric to open it underwater? I did. I trusted that he would pass the information on to you. Decent people are so easy to manipulate, Potter. I was sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons, and so he did. But even then, Potter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was watching all the time . . . all those hours in the library. Didn\u2019t you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along? I planted it there early on, I gave it to the Longbottom boy, don\u2019t you remember? Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. It would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed. I expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help. Longbottom would have told you in an instant. But you did not . . . you did not. . . . You have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all.\n\n\u201cSo what could I do? Feed you information from another innocent source. You told me at the Yule Ball a house-elf called Dobby had given you a Christmas present. I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning. I staged a loud conversation with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been taken, and whether Potter would think to use gillyweed. And your little elf friend ran straight to Snape\u2019s office and then hurried to find you. . . .\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s wand was still pointing directly at Harry\u2019s heart. Over his shoulder, foggy shapes were moving in the Foe-Glass on the wall.\n\n\u201cYou were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you had drowned. But luckily, Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. I breathed again.\n\n\u201cYou had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight, of course,\u201d said Moody. \u201cI was patrolling around it, able to see through the outer hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way. I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed. I put the Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish Diggory and leave your path to the Cup clear.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at Moody. He just didn\u2019t see how this could be. . . . Dumbledore\u2019s friend, the famous Auror . . . the one who had caught so many Death Eaters . . . It made no sense . . . no sense at all. . . .\n\nThe foggy shapes in the Foe-Glass were sharpening, had become more distinct. Harry could see the outlines of three people over Moody\u2019s shoulder, moving closer and closer. But Moody wasn\u2019t watching them. His magical eye was upon Harry.\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord didn\u2019t manage to kill you, Potter, and he so wanted to,\u201d whispered Moody. \u201cImagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him. I gave you to him \u2014 the thing he needed above all to regenerate \u2014 and then I killed you for him. I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters. I will be his dearest, his closest supporter . . . closer than a son. . . .\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s normal eye was bulging, the magical eye fixed upon Harry. The door was barred, and Harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time. . . .\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord and I,\u201d said Moody, and he looked completely insane now, towering over Harry, leering down at him, \u201chave much in common. Both of us, for instance, had very disappointing fathers . . . very disappointing indeed. Both of us suffered the indignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers. And both of us had the pleasure . . . the very great pleasure . . . of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d Harry said \u2014 he couldn\u2019t stop himself \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re mad!\u201d\n\n\u201cMad, am I?\u201d said Moody, his voice rising uncontrollably. \u201cWe\u2019ll see! We\u2019ll see who\u2019s mad, now that the Dark Lord has returned, with me at his side! He is back, Harry Potter, you did not conquer him \u2014 and now \u2014 I conquer you!\u201d\n\nMoody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry plunged his own hand into his robes \u2014\n\n\u201cStupefy!\u201d There was a blinding flash of red light, and with a great splintering and crashing, the door of Moody\u2019s office was blasted apart \u2014\n\nMoody was thrown backward onto the office floor. Harry, still staring at the place where Moody\u2019s face had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape, and Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of the Foe-Glass. He looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front, his wand outstretched.\n\nAt that moment, Harry fully understood for the first time why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard Voldemort had ever feared. The look upon Dumbledore\u2019s face as he stared down at the unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more terrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore\u2019s face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat.\n\nHe stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath Moody\u2019s unconscious body, and kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible. Snape followed him, looking into the Foe-Glass, where his own face was still visible, glaring into the room. Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.\n\n\u201cCome along, Potter,\u201d she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. \u201cCome along . . . hospital wing . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dumbledore sharply.\n\n\u201cDumbledore, he ought to \u2014 look at him \u2014 he\u2019s been through enough tonight \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will stay, Minerva, because he needs to understand,\u201d said Dumbledore curtly. \u201cUnderstanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery. He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight, and why.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoody,\u201d Harry said. He was still in a state of complete disbelief. \u201cHow can it have been Moody?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not Alastor Moody,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cYou have never known Alastor Moody. The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight. The moment he took you, I knew \u2014 and I followed.\u201d\n\nDumbledore bent down over Moody\u2019s limp form and put a hand inside his robes. He pulled out Moody\u2019s hip flask and a set of keys on a ring. Then he turned to Professors McGonagall and Snape.\n\n\u201cSeverus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess, and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house-elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly go down to Hagrid\u2019s house, where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly, then come back here.\u201d\n\nIf either Snape or McGonagall found these instructions peculiar, they hid their confusion. Both turned at once and left the office. Dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key in the lock, and opened it. It contained a mass of spellbooks. Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a second key in the second lock, and opened the trunk again. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it contained an assortment of broken Sneakoscopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery Invisibility Cloak. Harry watched, astounded, as Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the trunk, and each time revealing different contents. Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.\n\nHe was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, and lying on the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in appearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His wooden leg was gone, the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid, and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing. Harry stared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping Moody in the trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the floor of the office.\n\nDumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over him.\n\n\u201cStunned \u2014 controlled by the Imperius Curse \u2014 very weak,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, they would have needed to keep him alive. Harry, throw down the imposter\u2019s cloak \u2014 he\u2019s freezing. Madam Pomfrey will need to see him, but he seems in no immediate danger.\u201d\n\nHarry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody in the cloak, tucked it around him, and clambered out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and turned it over. A thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floor.\n\n\u201cPolyjuice Potion, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYou see the simplicity of it, and the brilliance. For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask, he\u2019s well known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep the real Moody close by, so that he could continue making the potion. You see his hair . . .\u201d Dumbledore looked down on the Moody in the trunk. \u201cThe imposter has been cutting it off all year, see where it is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight, our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done . . . on the hour . . . every hour. . . . We shall see.\u201d\n\nDumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious Moody on the floor. Harry stared at him too. Minutes passed in silence. . . .\n\nThen, before Harry\u2019s very eyes, the face of the man on the floor began to change. The scars were disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink. The long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw. Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the magical eyeball had popped out of the man\u2019s face as a real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every direction.\n\nHarry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair. He knew who he was. He had seen him in Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve, had watched him being led away from court by the dementors, trying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was innocent . . . but he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older. . . .\n\nThere were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor. Snape had returned with Winky at his heels. Professor McGonagall was right behind them.\n\n\u201cCrouch!\u201d Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway. \u201cBarty Crouch!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heavens,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floor.\n\nFilthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape\u2019s legs. Her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek.\n\n\u201cMaster Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?\u201d\n\nShe flung herself forward onto the young man\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cYou is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed Master\u2019s son!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is simply Stunned, Winky,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cStep aside, please. Severus, you have the potion?\u201d\n\nSnape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid: the Veritaserum with which he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got up, bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the Foe-Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them all. Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face. Dumbledore forced the man\u2019s mouth open and poured three drops inside it. Then he pointed his wand at the man\u2019s chest and said, \u201cRennervate.\u201d\n\nCrouch\u2019s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his gaze unfocused. Dumbledore knelt before him, so that their faces were level.\n\n\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d Dumbledore asked quietly.\n\nThe man\u2019s eyelids flickered.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he muttered.\n\n\u201cI would like you to tell us,\u201d said Dumbledore softly, \u201chow you came to be here. How did you escape from Azkaban?\u201d\n\nCrouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began to speak in a flat, expressionless voice.\n\n\u201cMy mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother\u2019s hairs. She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my hairs. We took on each other\u2019s appearance.\u201d\n\nWinky was shaking her head, trembling.\n\n\u201cSay no more, Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into trouble!\u201d\n\nBut Crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voice.\n\n\u201cThe dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My father smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watching through their doors.\n\n\u201cMy mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s eyelids flickered.\n\n\u201cAnd what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?\u201d said Dumbledore quietly.\n\n\u201cStaged my mother\u2019s death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty. The house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I had recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master . . . of returning to his service.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did your father subdue you?\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cThe Imperius Curse,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cI was under my father\u2019s control. I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night. I was always with the house-elf. She was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She persuaded my father to give me occasional treats. Rewards for my good behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster Barty, Master Barty,\u201d sobbed Winky through her hands. \u201cYou isn\u2019t ought to tell them, we is getting in trouble. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDid anybody ever discover that you were still alive?\u201d said Dumbledore softly. \u201cDid anyone know except your father and the house-elf?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. \u201cA witch in my father\u2019s office. Bertha Jorkins. She came to the house with papers for my father\u2019s signature. He was not at home. Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me. She came to investigate. She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak. My father arrived home. She confronted him. He put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to make her forget what she\u2019d found out. Too powerful. He said it damaged her memory permanently.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is she coming to nose into my master\u2019s private business?\u201d sobbed Winky. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t she leaving us be?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me about the Quidditch World Cup,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWinky talked my father into it,\u201d said Crouch, still in the same monotonous voice. \u201cShe spent months persuading him. I had not left the house for years. I had loved Quidditch. Let him go, she said. He will be in his Invisibility Cloak. He can watch. Let him smell fresh air for once. She said my mother would have wanted it. She told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom. She had not saved me for a life of imprisonment. He agreed in the end.\n\n\u201cIt was carefully planned. My father led me and Winky up to the Top Box early in the day. Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father. I was to sit there, invisible. When everyone had left the box, we would emerge. Winky would appear to be alone. Nobody would ever know.\n\n\u201cBut Winky didn\u2019t know that I was growing stronger. I was starting to fight my father\u2019s Imperius Curse. There were times when I was almost myself again. There were brief periods when I seemed outside his control. It happened, there, in the Top Box. It was like waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in public, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front of me, a wand sticking out of a boy\u2019s pocket. I had not been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it. Winky didn\u2019t know. Winky is frightened of heights. She had her face hidden.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster Barty, you bad boy!\u201d whispered Winky, tears trickling between her fingers.\n\n\u201cSo you took the wand,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cand what did you do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe went back to the tent,\u201d said Crouch. \u201cThen we heard them. We heard the Death Eaters. The ones who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had never suffered for my master. They had turned their backs on him. They were not enslaved, as I was. They were free to seek him, but they did not. They were merely making sport of Muggles. The sound of their voices awoke me. My mind was clearer than it had been in years. I was angry. I had the wand. I wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My father had left the tent; he had gone to free the Muggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry. She used her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She pulled me from the tent, pulled me into the forest, away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her back. I wanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show those Death Eaters what loyalty to the Dark Lord meant, and to punish them for their lack of it. I used the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky.\n\n\u201cMinistry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells everywhere. One of the spells came through the trees where Winky and I stood. The bond connecting us was broken. We were both Stunned.\n\n\u201cWhen Winky was discovered, my father knew I must be nearby. He searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there. He waited until the other Ministry members had left the forest. He put me back under the Imperius Curse and took me home. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him. She had let me acquire a wand. She had almost let me escape.\u201d\n\nWinky let out a wail of despair.\n\n\u201cNow it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And then . . . and then . . .\u201d Crouch\u2019s head rolled on his neck, and an insane grin spread across his face. \u201cMy master came for me.\n\n\u201cHe arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail. My master had found out that I was still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania. He had tortured her. She told him a great deal. She told him about the Triwizard Tournament. She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach at Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm my father had placed upon her. She told him I had escaped from Azkaban. She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master. And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant \u2014 perhaps the most faithful of all. My master conceived a plan, based upon the information Bertha had given him. He needed me. He arrived at our house near midnight. My father answered the door.\u201d\n\nThe smile spread wider over Crouch\u2019s face, as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life. Winky\u2019s petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers. She seemed too appalled to speak.\n\n\u201cIt was very quick. My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master. Now my father was the one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced him to go about his business as usual, to act as though nothing was wrong. And I was released. I awoke. I was myself again, alive as I hadn\u2019t been in years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cHe asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him. I was ready. It was my dream, my greatest ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts. A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry Potter. Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn the Cup into a Portkey, which would take the first person to touch it to my master. But first \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou needed Alastor Moody,\u201d said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained calm.\n\n\u201cWormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand. We journeyed to his house. Moody put up a struggle. There was a commotion. We managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I became Moody\u2019s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody\u2019s clothes and Dark Detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boomslang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me in his office, I said I was under orders to search it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWormtail returned to care for my master, in my father\u2019s house, and to keep watch over my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your father escaped,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done. There were periods when he knew what was happening. My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.\n\n\u201cMy master sent me word of my father\u2019s escape. He told me to stop him at all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry Potter. The map that had almost ruined everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cMap?\u201d said Dumbledore quickly. \u201cWhat map is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter\u2019s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape\u2019s office one night. He thought I was my father. We have the same first name. I took the map from Potter that night. I told him my father hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was after Snape.\n\n\u201cFor a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last, one evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking around the edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and Krum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum. I killed my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoooo!\u201d wailed Winky. \u201cMaster Barty, Master Barty, what is you saying?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou killed your father,\u201d Dumbledore said, in the same soft voice. \u201cWhat did you do with the body?\u201d\n\n\u201cCarried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come.\n\n\u201cDumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my father\u2019s body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father\u2019s body. He became a bone . . . I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid\u2019s cabin.\u201d\n\nThere was complete silence now, except for Winky\u2019s continued sobs. Then Dumbledore said, \u201cAnd tonight . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,\u201d whispered Barty Crouch. \u201cTurned it into a Portkey. My master\u2019s plan worked. He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards.\u201d\n\nThe insane smile lit his features once more, and his head drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter36": "THE PARTING OF THE WAYS\n\n\n\n\nDumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a moment with disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly. He turned to Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cMinerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly nauseous, as though she had just watched someone being sick. However, when she drew out her wand and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was quite steady.\n\n\u201cSeverus\u201d \u2014 Dumbledore turned to Snape \u2014 \u201cplease tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing. Then go down into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and bring him up to this office. He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour\u2019s time if he needs me.\u201d\n\nSnape nodded silently and swept out of the room.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d Dumbledore said gently.\n\nHarry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He also realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor.\n\n\u201cI want you to come up to my office first, Harry,\u201d he said quietly as they headed up the passageway. \u201cSirius is waiting for us there.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it. He didn\u2019t want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup. He didn\u2019t want to have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs, which kept flashing across his mind. Mad-Eye Moody, inside the trunk. Wormtail, slumped on the ground, cradling his stump of an arm. Voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric . . . dead . . . Cedric, asking to be returned to his parents. . . .\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d Harry mumbled, \u201cwhere are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are with Professor Sprout,\u201d said Dumbledore. His voice, which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for the first time. \u201cShe was Head of Cedric\u2019s House, and knew him best.\u201d\n\nThey had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore gave the password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door. Dumbledore pushed it open. Sirius was standing there. His face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment, he had crossed the room.\n\n\u201cHarry, are you all right? I knew it \u2014 I knew something like this \u2014 what happened?\u201d\n\nHis hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the desk.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked more urgently.\n\nDumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had said. Harry was only half listening. So tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn\u2019t have to think or feel anymore.\n\nThere was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry\u2019s knee.\n\n\u201c\u2019Lo, Fawkes,\u201d said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix\u2019s beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up at him. There was something comforting about his warm weight.\n\nDumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.\n\n\u201cI need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cWe can leave that till morning, can\u2019t we, Dumbledore?\u201d said Sirius harshly. He had put a hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet him have a sleep. Let him rest.\u201d\n\nHarry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius\u2019s words. He leaned forward toward Harry. Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.\n\n\u201cIf I thought I could help you,\u201d Dumbledore said gently, \u201cby putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what happened.\u201d\n\nThe phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.\n\nHe took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves around them; he saw Cedric\u2019s body, lying on the ground beside the cup.\n\nOnce or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry\u2019s shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief; he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel better.\n\nWhen Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry started. Dumbledore walked around the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm. Harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them.\n\n\u201cHe said my blood would make him stronger than if he\u2019d used someone else\u2019s,\u201d Harry told Dumbledore. \u201cHe said the protection my \u2014 my mother left in me \u2014 he\u2019d have it too. And he was right \u2014 he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched my face.\u201d\n\nFor a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore\u2019s eyes. But next second, Harry was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had ever seen him.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, sitting down again. \u201cVoldemort has overcome that particular barrier. Harry, continue, please.\u201d\n\nHarry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from the cauldron, and told them all he could remember of Voldemort\u2019s speech to the Death Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.\n\nBut when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and Voldemort\u2019s wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had come out of Voldemort\u2019s wand were flooding into his mind. He could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins . . . his father . . . his mother . . .\n\nHe was glad when Sirius broke the silence.\n\n\u201cThe wands connected?\u201d he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was an arrested look.\n\n\u201cPriori Incantatem,\u201d he muttered.\n\nHis eyes gazed into Harry\u2019s and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.\n\n\u201cThe Reverse Spell effect?\u201d said Sirius sharply.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHarry\u2019s wand and Voldemort\u2019s wand share cores. Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This phoenix, in fact,\u201d he added, and he pointed at the scarlet-and-gold bird, perching peacefully on Harry\u2019s knee.\n\n\u201cMy wand\u2019s feather came from Fawkes?\u201d Harry said, amazed.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cMr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what happens when a wand meets its brother?\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cThey will not work properly against each other,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cIf, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle . . . a very rare effect will take place. One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed \u2014 in reverse. The most recent first . . . and then those which preceded it. . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry\u2019s face, \u201cthat some form of Cedric must have reappeared.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded again.\n\n\u201cDiggory came back to life?\u201d said Sirius sharply.\n\n\u201cNo spell can reawaken the dead,\u201d said Dumbledore heavily. \u201cAll that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe spoke to me,\u201d Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again. \u201cThe . . . the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn echo,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwhich retained Cedric\u2019s appearance and character. I am guessing other such forms appeared . . . less recent victims of Voldemort\u2019s wand. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAn old man,\u201d Harry said, his throat still constricted. \u201cBertha Jorkins. And . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYour parents?\u201d said Dumbledore quietly.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\nSirius\u2019s grip on Harry\u2019s shoulder was now so tight it was painful.\n\n\u201cThe last murders the wand performed,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding. \u201cIn reverse order. More would have appeared, of course, had you maintained the connection. Very well, Harry, these echoes, these shadows . . . what did they do?\u201d\n\nHarry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web, how Voldemort had seemed to fear them, how the shadow of Harry\u2019s father had told him what to do, how Cedric\u2019s had made its final request.\n\nAt this point, Harry found he could not continue. He looked around at Sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands.\n\nHarry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee. The phoenix had fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beautiful head against Harry\u2019s injured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider. The pain vanished. The skin mended. His leg was repaired.\n\n\u201cI will say it again,\u201d said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door. \u201cYou have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight, Harry. You have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You have shouldered a grown wizard\u2019s burden and found yourself equal to it \u2014 and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect. You will come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace . . . Sirius, would you like to stay with him?\u201d\n\nSirius nodded and stood up. He transformed back into the great black dog and walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.\n\nWhen Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was and what had happened to him. All of them whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream.\n\n\u201cHarry! Oh Harry!\u201d\n\nShe started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.\n\n\u201cMolly,\u201d he said, holding up a hand, \u201cplease listen to me for a moment. Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,\u201d he added, looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, \u201cyou may do so. But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this evening.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron, Hermione, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed, \u201cDid you hear? He needs quiet!\u201d\n\n\u201cHeadmaster,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black dog that was Sirius, \u201cmay I ask what \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,\u201d said Dumbledore simply. \u201cI assure you, he is extremely well trained. Harry \u2014 I will wait while you get into bed.\u201d\n\nHarry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore for asking the others not to question him. It wasn\u2019t as though he didn\u2019t want them there; but the thought of explaining it all over again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he could stand.\n\n\u201cI will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school.\u201d He left.\n\nAs Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room. His wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table.\n\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him. He took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione were looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he told them. \u201cJust tired.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers unnecessarily.\n\nMadam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to drink all of this, Harry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a potion for dreamless sleep.\u201d\n\nHarry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything around him became hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed; his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather mattress. Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep.\n\nHarry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn\u2019t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn\u2019t have been asleep very long.\n\nThen he heard whispering around him.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll wake him if they don\u2019t shut up!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are they shouting about? Nothing else can have happened, can it?\u201d\n\nHarry opened his eyes blearily. Someone had removed his glasses. He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs. Weasley and Bill close by. Mrs. Weasley was on her feet.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Fudge\u2019s voice,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Minerva McGonagall\u2019s, isn\u2019t it? But what are they arguing about?\u201d\n\nNow Harry could hear them too: people shouting and running toward the hospital wing.\n\n\u201cRegrettable, but all the same, Minerva \u2014\u201d Cornelius Fudge was saying loudly.\n\n\u201cYou should never have brought it inside the castle!\u201d yelled Professor McGonagall. \u201cWhen Dumbledore finds out \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry heard the hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens, Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.\n\nFudge came striding up the ward. Professors McGonagall and Snape were at his heels.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Dumbledore?\u201d Fudge demanded of Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley angrily. \u201cThis is a hospital wing, Minister, don\u2019t you think you\u2019d do better to \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping up the ward.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d said Dumbledore sharply, looking from Fudge to Professor McGonagall. \u201cWhy are you disturbing these people? Minerva, I\u2019m surprised at you \u2014 I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no need to stand guard over him anymore, Dumbledore!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cThe Minister has seen to that!\u201d\n\nHarry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like this. There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and her hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.\n\n\u201cWhen we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight\u2019s events,\u201d said Snape, in a low voice, \u201che seemed to feel his personal safety was in question. He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle. He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!\u201d Professor McGonagall fumed. \u201cI told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear woman!\u201d roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him, \u201cas Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Professor McGonagall\u2019s voice drowned Fudge\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe moment that \u2014 that thing entered the room,\u201d she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, \u201cit swooped down on Crouch and \u2014 and \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have done. It had administered its fatal Kiss to Barty Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.\n\n\u201cBy all accounts, he is no loss!\u201d blustered Fudge. \u201cIt seems he has been responsible for several deaths!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,\u201d said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly for the first time. \u201cHe cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy he killed them? Well, that\u2019s no mystery, is it?\u201d blustered Fudge. \u201cHe was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You-Know-Who\u2019s instructions!\u201d\n\n\u201cLord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius,\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cThose people\u2019s deaths were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body.\u201d\n\nFudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face. Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe what he had just heard. He began to sputter, still goggling at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwe heard Barty Crouch confess. Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort \u2014 learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins \u2014 went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped Voldemort to return.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee here, Dumbledore,\u201d said Fudge, and Harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face, \u201cyou \u2014 you can\u2019t seriously believe that. You-Know-Who \u2014 back? Come now, come now . . . certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You-Know-Who\u2019s orders \u2014 but to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,\u201d said Dumbledore steadily. \u201cHe witnessed Lord Voldemort\u2019s rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office.\u201d\n\nDumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was awake, but shook his head and said, \u201cI am afraid I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight.\u201d\n\nFudge\u2019s curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said, \u201cYou are \u2014 er \u2014 prepared to take Harry\u2019s word on this, are you, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence, which was broken by Sirius growling. His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at Fudge.\n\n\u201cCertainly, I believe Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. His eyes were blazing now. \u201cI heard Crouch\u2019s confession, and I heard Harry\u2019s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.\u201d\n\nFudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he glanced at Harry before answering.\n\n\u201cYou are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well . . .\u201d\n\nFudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,\u201d he said quietly.\n\nRon, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of them had realized that Harry was awake.\n\nFudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face.\n\n\u201cAnd if I have?\u201d he said, looking at Dumbledore. \u201cIf I have discovered that you\u2019ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the place \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?\u201d said Dumbledore coolly.\n\n\u201cYou admit that he has been having these pains, then?\u201d said Fudge quickly. \u201cHeadaches? Nightmares? Possibly \u2014 hallucinations?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to me, Cornelius,\u201d said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch. \u201cHarry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous.\u201d\n\nFudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less stubborn.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I\u2019ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I saw Voldemort come back!\u201d Harry shouted. He tried to get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. \u201cI saw the Death Eaters! I can give you their names! Lucius Malfoy \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape\u2019s eyes flew back to Fudge.\n\n\u201cMalfoy was cleared!\u201d said Fudge, visibly affronted. \u201cA very old family \u2014 donations to excellent causes \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMacnair!\u201d Harry continued.\n\n\u201cAlso cleared! Now working for the Ministry!\u201d\n\n\u201cAvery \u2014 Nott \u2014 Crabbe \u2014 Goyle \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago!\u201d said Fudge angrily. \u201cYou could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For heaven\u2019s sake, Dumbledore \u2014 the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too \u2014 his tales are getting taller, and you\u2019re still swallowing them \u2014 the boy can talk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he\u2019s trustworthy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fool!\u201d Professor McGonagall cried. \u201cCedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!\u201d\n\n\u201cI see no evidence to the contrary!\u201d shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling. \u201cIt seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!\u201d\n\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good-natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world \u2014 to believe that Voldemort could have risen.\n\n\u201cVoldemort has returned,\u201d Dumbledore repeated. \u201cIf you accept that fact straightaway, Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPreposterous!\u201d shouted Fudge again. \u201cRemove the dementors? I\u2019d be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort\u2019s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them!\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cThey will not remain loyal to you, Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind him, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!\u201d\n\nFudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage.\n\n\u201cThe second step you must take \u2014 and at once,\u201d Dumbledore pressed on, \u201cis to send envoys to the giants.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnvoys to the giants?\u201d Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. \u201cWhat madness is this?\u201d\n\n\u201cExtend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cor Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 you cannot be serious!\u201d Fudge gasped, shaking his head and retreating further from Dumbledore. \u201cIf the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants \u2014 people hate them, Dumbledore \u2014 end of my career \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are blinded,\u201d said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, \u201cby the love of the office you hold, Cornelius! You place too much importance, and you always have done, on the so-called purity of blood! You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any \u2014 and see what that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now \u2014 take the steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known. Fail to act \u2014 and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!\u201d\n\n\u201cInsane,\u201d whispered Fudge, still backing away. \u201cMad . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of Harry\u2019s bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs. Weasley was still standing over Harry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising. Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at Fudge.\n\n\u201cIf your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this, Cornelius,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwe have reached a parting of the ways. You must act as you see fit. And I \u2014 I shall act as I see fit.\u201d\n\nDumbledore\u2019s voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a mere statement, but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand.\n\n\u201cNow, see here, Dumbledore,\u201d he said, waving a threatening finger. \u201cI\u2019ve given you free rein, always. I\u2019ve had a lot of respect for you. I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I\u2019ve kept quiet. There aren\u2019t many who\u2019d have let you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry. But if you\u2019re going to work against me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only one against whom I intend to work,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cis Lord Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side.\u201d\n\nIt seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands. Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, \u201cHe can\u2019t be back, Dumbledore, he just can\u2019t be . . .\u201d\n\nSnape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Snape harshly. \u201cThere. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff\u2019s too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord\u2019s vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.\u201d\n\nFudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking his head. He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape\u2019s arm, then looked up at Dumbledore and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the Ministry.\u201d\n\nHe had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned around, strode back down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry\u2019s bed.\n\n\u201cYour winnings,\u201d he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto Harry\u2019s bedside table. \u201cOne thousand Galleons. There should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances . . .\u201d\n\nHe crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry\u2019s bed.\n\n\u201cThere is work to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cMolly . . . am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you can,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. She was white to the lips, but she looked resolute. \u201cWe know what Fudge is. It\u2019s Arthur\u2019s fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper Wizarding pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I need to send a message to Arthur,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAll those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well placed to contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go to Dad,\u201d said Bill, standing up. \u201cI\u2019ll go now.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cTell him what has happened. Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d said Bill.\n\nHe clapped a hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder, kissed his mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.\n\n\u201cMinerva,\u201d said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall, \u201cI want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also \u2014 if she will consent to come \u2014 Madame Maxime.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.\n\n\u201cPoppy,\u201d Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, \u201cwould you be very kind and go down to Professor Moody\u2019s office, where I think you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery \u2014 very well,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and she too left.\n\nDumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that Madam Pomfrey\u2019s footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d he said, \u201cit is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are. Sirius . . . if you could resume your usual form.\u201d\n\nThe great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.\n\nMrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.\n\n\u201cSirius Black!\u201d she shrieked, pointing at him.\n\n\u201cMum, shut up!\u201d Ron yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d\n\nSnape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his face was one of mingled fury and horror.\n\n\u201cHim!\u201d he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal dislike. \u201cWhat is he doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is here at my invitation,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking between them, \u201cas are you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other.\u201d\n\nHarry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle. Sirius and Snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing.\n\n\u201cI will settle, in the short term,\u201d said Dumbledore, with a bite of impatience in his voice, \u201cfor a lack of open hostility. You will shake hands. You are on the same side now. Time is short, and unless the few of us who know the truth stand united, there is no hope for any of us.\u201d\n\nVery slowly \u2014 but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill \u2014 Sirius and Snape moved toward each other and shook hands. They let go extremely quickly.\n\n\u201cThat will do to be going on with,\u201d said Dumbledore, stepping between them once more. \u201cNow I have work for each of you. Fudge\u2019s attitude, though not unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher \u2014 the old crowd. Lie low at Lupin\u2019s for a while; I will contact you there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to have to say good-bye again so quickly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see me very soon, Harry,\u201d said Sirius, turning to him. \u201cI promise you. But I must do what I can, you understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYeah . . . of course I do.\u201d\n\nSirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, transformed again into the black dog, and ran the length of the room to the door, whose handle he turned with a paw. Then he was gone.\n\n\u201cSeverus,\u201d said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, \u201cyou know what I must ask you to do. If you are ready . . . if you are prepared . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d said Snape.\n\nHe looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.\n\n\u201cThen good luck,\u201d said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after Sirius.\n\nIt was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.\n\n\u201cI must go downstairs,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI must see the Diggorys. Harry \u2014 take the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later.\u201d\n\nHarry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore disappeared. Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at him. None of them spoke for a very long time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,\u201d Mrs. Weasley said at last. Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet. \u201cYou have a good long sleep. Try and think about something else for a while . . . think about what you\u2019re going to buy with your winnings!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that gold,\u201d said Harry in an expressionless voice. \u201cYou have it. Anyone can have it. I shouldn\u2019t have won it. It should\u2019ve been Cedric\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Harry,\u201d Mrs. Weasley whispered.\n\n\u201cI told him to take the Cup with me,\u201d said Harry.\n\nNow the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron would look away.\n\nMrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as Mrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother\u2019s face, his father\u2019s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.\n\nThere was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry broke apart. Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her hand.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cYour potion, Harry,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley quickly, wiping her eyes on the back of her hand.\n\nHarry drank it in one gulp. The effect was instantaneous. Heavy, irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him; he fell back onto his pillows and thought no more."}
{"4-Harry-Potter-and-the-Goblet-of-Fire-chapter37": "THE BEGINNING\n\n\n\n\nWhen he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days. It was as though he had been through too much to take in any more. The recollections he did have were very painful. The worst, perhaps, was the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following morning.\n\nThey did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric\u2019s body to them. Mr. Diggory sobbed through most of the interview. Mrs. Diggory\u2019s grief seemed to be beyond tears.\n\n\u201cHe suffered very little then,\u201d she said, when Harry had told her how Cedric had died. \u201cAnd after all, Amos . . . he died just when he\u2019d won the tournament. He must have been happy.\u201d\n\nWhen they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry and said, \u201cYou look after yourself, now.\u201d\n\nHarry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.\n\n\u201cYou take this,\u201d he muttered to her. \u201cIt should\u2019ve been Cedric\u2019s, he got there first, you take it \u2014\u201d\n\nBut she backed away from him.\n\n\u201cOh no, it\u2019s yours, dear, I couldn\u2019t . . . you keep it.\u201d\n\nHarry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening. From what Hermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast. He had merely requested that they leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his eyes. Some whispered behind their hands as he passed. He guessed that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter\u2019s article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was. Perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how Cedric had died. He found he didn\u2019t care very much. He liked it best when he was with Ron and Hermione and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess. He felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didn\u2019t need to put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of what was going on outside Hogwarts \u2014 and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain. The only time they touched upon the subject was when Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs. Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.\n\n\u201cShe went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least at first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cShe said Dumbledore\u2019s got his reasons,\u201d said Ron, shaking his head darkly. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ve got to trust him, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nThe only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt able to talk to was Hagrid. As there was no longer a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, they had those lessons free. They used the one on Thursday afternoon to go down and visit Hagrid in his cabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded out of the open door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail madly.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d called Hagrid, coming to the door. \u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nHe strode out to meet them, pulled Harry into a one-armed hug, ruffled his hair, and said, \u201cGood ter see yeh, mate. Good ter see yeh.\u201d\n\nThey saw two bucket-size cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the fireplace when they entered Hagrid\u2019s cabin.\n\n\u201cBin havin\u2019 a cuppa with Olympe,\u201d Hagrid said. \u201cShe\u2019s jus\u2019 left.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d said Ron curiously.\n\n\u201cMadame Maxime, o\u2019 course!\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cYou two made up, have you?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cDunno what yeh\u2019re talkin\u2019 about,\u201d said Hagrid airily, fetching more cups from the dresser. When he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed Harry closely through his beetle-black eyes.\n\n\u201cYou all righ\u2019?\u201d he said gruffly.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo, yeh\u2019re not,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201c\u2019Course yeh\u2019re not. But yeh will be.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing.\n\n\u201cKnew he was goin\u2019 ter come back,\u201d said Hagrid, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up at him, shocked. \u201cKnown it fer years, Harry. Knew he was out there, bidin\u2019 his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has, an\u2019 we\u2019ll jus\u2019 have ter get on with it. We\u2019ll fight. Migh\u2019 be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. That\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s plan, anyway. Great man, Dumbledore. \u2019S long as we\u2019ve got him, I\u2019m not too worried.\u201d\n\nHagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces.\n\n\u201cNo good sittin\u2019 worryin\u2019 abou\u2019 it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s comin\u2019 will come, an\u2019 we\u2019ll meet it when it does. Dumbledore told me wha\u2019 you did, Harry.\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s chest swelled as he looked at Harry.\n\n\u201cYeh did as much as yer father would\u2019ve done, an\u2019 I can\u2019 give yeh no higher praise than that.\u201d\n\nHarry smiled back at him. It was the first time he\u2019d smiled in days. \u201cWhat\u2019s Dumbledore asked you to do, Hagrid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him \u2014 that night.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot a little job fer me over the summer,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cSecret, though. I\u2019m not s\u2019pposed ter talk abou\u2019 it, no, not even ter you lot. Olympe \u2014 Madame Maxime ter you \u2014 might be comin\u2019 with me. I think she will. Think I got her persuaded.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it to do with Voldemort?\u201d\n\nHagrid flinched at the sound of the name.\n\n\u201cMigh\u2019 be,\u201d he said evasively. \u201cNow . . . who\u2019d like ter come an\u2019 visit the las\u2019 skrewt with me? I was jokin\u2019 \u2014 jokin\u2019!\u201d he added hastily, seeing the looks on their faces.\n\nIt was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the night before his return to Privet Drive. He was dreading the Leaving Feast, which was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the Inter-House Championship would be announced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students.\n\nWhen he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing. The Great Hall was normally decorated with the winning House\u2019s colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers\u2019 table. Harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to Cedric.\n\nThe real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone spoke to him. Harry couldn\u2019t blame him; Moody\u2019s fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk. Professor Karkaroff\u2019s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with him.\n\nMadame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid. They were talking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting next to Professor McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment as Harry looked at him. His expression was difficult to read. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever. Harry continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked away.\n\nWhat was it that Snape had done on Dumbledore\u2019s orders, the night that Voldemort had returned? And why . . . why . . . was Dumbledore so convinced that Snape was truly on their side? He had been their spy, Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape had turned spy against Voldemort, \u201cat great personal risk.\u201d Was that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact with the Death Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone over to Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself, biding his time?\n\nHarry\u2019s musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff table. The Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became very quiet.\n\n\u201cThe end,\u201d said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, \u201cof another year.\u201d\n\nHe paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the Hall.\n\n\u201cThere is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cbut I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here,\u201d he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, \u201cenjoying our feast with us. I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.\u201d\n\nThey did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, \u201cCedric Diggory.\u201d\n\nHarry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were tears pouring silently down her face. He looked down at the table as they all sat down again.\n\n\u201cCedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff House,\u201d Dumbledore continued. \u201cHe was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not. I think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.\u201d\n\nHarry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cCedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.\u201d\n\nA panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Magic,\u201d Dumbledore continued, \u201cdoes not wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so \u2014 either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.\u201d\n\nStunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned toward Dumbledore now . . . or almost every face. Over at the Slytherin table, Harry saw Draco Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle. Harry felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach. He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cThere is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric\u2019s death,\u201d Dumbledore went on. \u201cI am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.\u201d\n\nA kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in Harry\u2019s direction before flicking back to face Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe risked his own life to return Cedric\u2019s body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honor him.\u201d\n\nDumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once more. Nearly everyone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as they had murmured Cedric\u2019s, and drank to him. But through a gap in the standing figures, Harry saw that Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched. Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.\n\nWhen everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued, \u201cThe Triwizard Tournament\u2019s aim was to further and promote magical understanding. In the light of what has happened \u2014 of Lord Voldemort\u2019s return \u2014 such ties are more important than ever before.\u201d\n\nDumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons students, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the Slytherin table. Krum, Harry saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though he expected Dumbledore to say something harsh.\n\n\u201cEvery guest in this Hall,\u201d said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, \u201cwill be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come. I say to you all, once again \u2014 in the light of Lord Voldemort\u2019s return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemort\u2019s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.\n\n\u201cIt is my belief \u2014 and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken \u2014 that we are all facing dark and difficult times. Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn asunder. A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.\n\n\u201cRemember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of it. He, Ron, and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to Hogsmeade station. It was another beautiful summer\u2019s day. He supposed that Privet Drive would be hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that evening. The thought gave him no pleasure at all.\n\n\u201c\u2019Arry!\u201d\n\nHe looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds, Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take off.\n\n\u201cWe will see each uzzer again, I \u2019ope,\u201d said Fleur as she reached him, holding out her hand. \u201cI am \u2019oping to get a job \u2019ere, to improve my Eenglish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good already,\u201d said Ron in a strangled sort of voice. Fleur smiled at him; Hermione scowled.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, \u2019Arry,\u201d said Fleur, turning to go. \u201cIt \u2019az been a pleasure meeting you!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s spirits couldn\u2019t help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight.\n\n\u201cWonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back,\u201d said Ron. \u201cD\u2019you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff?\u201d\n\n\u201cKarkaroff did not steer,\u201d said a gruff voice. \u201cHe stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork.\u201d\n\nKrum had come to say good-bye to Hermione.\n\n\u201cCould I have a vord?\u201d he asked her.\n\n\u201cOh . . . yes . . . all right,\u201d said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up!\u201d Ron called loudly after her. \u201cThe carriages\u2019ll be here in a minute!\u201d\n\nHe let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what Krum and Hermione might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared at Hermione, but her face was quite impassive.\n\n\u201cI liked Diggory,\u201d said Krum abruptly to Harry. \u201cHe vos alvays polite to me. Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang \u2014 with Karkaroff,\u201d he added, scowling.\n\n\u201cHave you got a new headmaster yet?\u201d said Harry.\n\nKrum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook Harry\u2019s hand, and then Ron\u2019s. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle. Krum had already started walking away when Ron burst out, \u201cCan I have your autograph?\u201d\n\nHermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for Ron.\n\nThe weather could not have been more different on the journey back to King\u2019s Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the previous September. There wasn\u2019t a single cloud in the sky. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under Ron\u2019s dress robes to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig was dozing, her head under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large, furry ginger cushion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward. Harry felt as though Dumbledore\u2019s speech at the Leaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow. It was less painful to discuss what had happened now. They broke off their conversation about what action Dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop Voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived.\n\nWhen Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet that she had been carrying in there. Harry looked at it, unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say, but Hermione, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in there. You can look for yourself, but there\u2019s nothing at all. I\u2019ve been checking every day. Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament. They didn\u2019t even mention Cedric. Nothing about any of it. If you ask me, Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll never keep Rita quiet,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNot on a story like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Rita hasn\u2019t written anything at all since the third task,\u201d said Hermione in an oddly constrained voice. \u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d she added, her voice now trembling slightly, \u201cRita Skeeter isn\u2019t going to be writing anything at all for a while. Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn\u2019t supposed to be coming onto the grounds,\u201d said Hermione in a rush.\n\nHarry had the impression that Hermione had been dying to tell them this for days, but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had happened.\n\n\u201cHow was she doing it?\u201d said Harry at once.\n\n\u201cHow did you find out?\u201d said Ron, staring at her.\n\n\u201cWell, it was you, really, who gave me the idea, Harry,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDid I?\u201d said Harry, perplexed. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cBugging,\u201d said Hermione happily.\n\n\u201cBut you said they didn\u2019t work \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh not electronic bugs,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cNo, you see . . . Rita Skeeter\u201d \u2014 Hermione\u2019s voice trembled with quiet triumph \u2014 \u201cis an unregistered Animagus. She can turn \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out of her bag.\n\n\u201c\u2014 into a beetle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou haven\u2019t . . . she\u2019s not . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes she is,\u201d said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at them.\n\nInside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s never \u2014 you\u2019re kidding \u2014\u201d Ron whispered, lifting the jar to his eyes.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Hermione, beaming. \u201cI caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very closely, and you\u2019ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears.\u201d\n\nHarry looked and saw that she was quite right. He also remembered something.\n\n\u201cThere was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we\u2019d had our conversation by the lake. And unless I\u2019m very much mistaken, Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt. She\u2019s been buzzing around for stories all year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we saw Malfoy under that tree . . .\u201d said Ron slowly.\n\n\u201cHe was talking to her, in his hand,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHe knew, of course. That\u2019s how she\u2019s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They wouldn\u2019t care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid.\u201d\n\nHermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the beetle, which buzzed angrily against the glass.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told her I\u2019ll let her out when we get back to London,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI\u2019ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so she can\u2019t transform. And I\u2019ve told her she\u2019s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can\u2019t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people.\u201d\n\nSmiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag.\n\nThe door of the compartment slid open.\n\n\u201cVery clever, Granger,\u201d said Draco Malfoy.\n\nCrabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had ever seen them.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his lips. \u201cYou caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s favorite boy again. Big deal.\u201d\n\nHis smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.\n\n\u201cTrying not to think about it, are we?\u201d said Malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them. \u201cTrying to pretend it hasn\u2019t happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledore\u2019s speech about Cedric. He could feel a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand under his robes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!\u201d He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. \u201cToo late now, Potter! They\u2019ll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord\u2019s back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well \u2014 second \u2014 Diggory was the f \u2014\u201d\n\nIt was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry blinked and looked down at the floor.\n\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway. He, Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of them having used a different hex. Nor were they the only ones to have done so.\n\n\u201cThought we\u2019d see what those three were up to,\u201d said Fred matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had his wand out, and so did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.\n\n\u201cInteresting effect,\u201d said George, looking down at Crabbe. \u201cWho used the Furnunculus Curse?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cOdd,\u201d said George lightly. \u201cI used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though those two shouldn\u2019t be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well, let\u2019s not leave them here, they don\u2019t add much to the decor.\u201d\n\nRon, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle \u2014 each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit \u2014 out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut.\n\n\u201cExploding Snap, anyone?\u201d said Fred, pulling out a pack of cards.\n\nThey were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask them.\n\n\u201cYou going to tell us, then?\u201d he said to George. \u201cWho you were blackmailing?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said George darkly. \u201cThat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything important. Not now, anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given up,\u201d said George, shrugging.\n\nBut Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred said, \u201cAll right, all right, if you really want to know . . . it was Ludo Bagman.\u201d\n\n\u201cBagman?\u201d said Harry sharply. \u201cAre you saying he was involved in \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d said George gloomily. \u201cNothing like that. Stupid git. He wouldn\u2019t have the brains.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what, then?\u201d said Ron.\n\nFred hesitated, then said, \u201cYou remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry and Ron slowly.\n\n\u201cWell, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he\u2019d caught from the Irish mascots.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Fred impatiently, \u201cit vanished, didn\u2019t it? By next morning, it had gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 it must\u2019ve been an accident, mustn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hermione.\n\nGeorge laughed very bitterly.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what we thought, at first. We thought if we just wrote to him, and told him he\u2019d made a mistake, he\u2019d cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored our letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to get away from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the end, he turned pretty nasty,\u201d said Fred. \u201cTold us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn\u2019t giving us anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we asked for our money back,\u201d said George, glowering.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t refuse!\u201d gasped Hermione.\n\n\u201cRight in one,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cBut that was all your savings!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d said George. \u201c\u2019Course, we found out what was going on in the end. Lee Jordan\u2019s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well. Turns out he\u2019s in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn\u2019t enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He\u2019s lost everything gambling. Hasn\u2019t got two Galleons to rub together. And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHe put a bet on you, mate,\u201d said Fred. \u201cPut a big bet on you to win the tournament. Bet against the goblins.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why he kept trying to help me win!\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell \u2014 I did win, didn\u2019t I? So he can pay you your gold!\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said George, shaking his head. \u201cThe goblins play as dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was betting you\u2019d win outright. So Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after the third task.\u201d\n\nGeorge sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again.\n\nThe rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never arrive at King\u2019s Cross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.\n\n\u201cFred \u2014 George \u2014 wait a moment.\u201d\n\nThe twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his Triwizard winnings.\n\n\u201cTake it,\u201d he said, and he thrust the sack into George\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Fred, looking flabbergasted.\n\n\u201cTake it,\u201d Harry repeated firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mental,\u201d said George, trying to push it back at Harry.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou take it, and get inventing. It\u2019s for the joke shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is mental,\u201d Fred said in an almost awed voice.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d said Harry firmly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take it, I\u2019m throwing it down the drain. I don\u2019t want it and I don\u2019t need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I\u2019ve got a feeling we\u2019re going to need them more than usual before long.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his hands, \u201cthere\u2019s got to be a thousand Galleons in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, grinning. \u201cThink how many Canary Creams that is.\u201d\n\nThe twins stared at him.\n\n\u201cJust don\u2019t tell your mum where you got it . . . although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore, come to think of it. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said flatly, \u201ctake it, or I\u2019ll hex you. I know some good ones now. Just do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they\u2019re from you.\u201d\n\nHe left the compartment before they could say another word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex marks.\n\nUncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs. Weasley was close by him. She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, \u201cI think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer. Keep in touch, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you, Harry,\u201d said Ron, clapping him on the back.\n\n\u201c\u2019Bye, Harry!\u201d said Hermione, and she did something she had never done before, and kissed him on the cheek.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 thanks,\u201d George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side.\n\nHarry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed him silently from the station. There was no point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car.\n\nAs Hagrid had said, what would come, would come . . . and he would have to meet it when it did."}
