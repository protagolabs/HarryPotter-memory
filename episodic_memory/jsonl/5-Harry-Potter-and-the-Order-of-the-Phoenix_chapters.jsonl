{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter1": "DUDLEY DEMENTED\n\n\n\n\nThe hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four.\n\nHe was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potter\u2019s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below.\n\nOn the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his aunt and uncle.\n\nAlmost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry\u2019s uncle, suddenly spoke. \u201cGlad to see the boy\u2019s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. \u201cNot in the house.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon grunted.\n\n\u201cWatching the news . . .\u201d he said scathingly. \u201cI\u2019d like to know what he\u2019s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what\u2019s on the news \u2014 Dudley hasn\u2019t got a clue what\u2019s going on, doubt he knows who the Prime Minister is! Anyway, it\u2019s not as if there\u2019d be anything about his lot on our news \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cVernon, shh!\u201d said Aunt Petunia. \u201cThe window\u2019s open!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 yes \u2014 sorry, dear . . .\u201d\n\nThe Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit \u2019N Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon\u2019s voice floated out of the window again.\n\n\u201cDudders out for tea?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the Polkisses\u2019,\u201d said Aunt Petunia fondly. \u201cHe\u2019s got so many little friends, he\u2019s so popular . . .\u201d\n\nHarry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way.\n\nThe opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o\u2019clock news reached Harry\u2019s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps tonight \u2014 after a month of waiting \u2014 would be the night \u2014\n\n\u201cRecord numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers\u2019 strike reaches its second week \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGive \u2019em a lifelong siesta, I would,\u201d snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreader\u2019s sentence, but no matter: Outside in the flower bed, Harry\u2019s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened, it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers . . .\n\nHe let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet . . .\n\nHe kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognized for what it really was by the Muggles \u2014 an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident . . . but the baggage-handlers\u2019 strike was followed by news on the drought in the Southeast (\u201cI hope he\u2019s listening next door!\u201d bellowed Uncle Vernon, \u201cwith his sprinklers on at three in the morning!\u201d); then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress\u2019s divorce from her famous husband (\u201cas if we\u2019re interested in their sordid affairs,\u201d sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).\n\nHarry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said, \u201cAnd finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find out more . . .\u201d\n\nHarry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing to crawl out from under the window.\n\nHe had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick succession.\n\nA loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys\u2019 living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword. But before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided with the Dursleys\u2019 open window, and the resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.\n\nHarry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise, but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat.\n\n\u201cPut \u2014 it \u2014 away!\u201d Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cNow! Before \u2014 anyone \u2014 sees!\u201d\n\n\u201cGet \u2014 off \u2014 me!\u201d Harry gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle\u2019s sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as the pain in the top of Harry\u2019s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an electric shock \u2014 some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold.\n\nPanting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened up, and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocent.\n\n\u201cLovely evening!\u201d shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number Seven, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. \u201cDid you hear that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!\u201d\n\nHe continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious neighbors had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him.\n\nHarry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the point at which Uncle Vernon\u2019s outstretched hands could resume their strangling.\n\n\u201cWhat the devil do you mean by it, boy?\u201d asked Uncle Vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury.\n\n\u201cWhat do I mean by what?\u201d said Harry coldly. He kept looking left and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise.\n\n\u201cMaking a racket like a starting pistol right outside our \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make that noise,\u201d said Harry firmly.\n\nAunt Petunia\u2019s thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon\u2019s wide, purple one. She looked livid.\n\n\u201cWhy were you lurking under our window?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our window, boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cListening to the news,\u201d said Harry in a resigned voice.\n\nHis aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.\n\n\u201cListening to the news! Again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it changes every day, you see,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you\u2019re really up to \u2014 and don\u2019t give me any more of this listening to the news tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful, Vernon!\u201d breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, \u201c. . . that your lot don\u2019t get on our news!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you know,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia said, \u201cYou\u2019re a nasty little liar. What are all those \u2014\u201d she too lowered her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, \u201c\u2014 owls \u2014 doing if they\u2019re not bringing you news?\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. \u201cGet out of that one, boy! As if we didn\u2019t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad Harry felt at admitting it.\n\n\u201cThe owls . . . aren\u2019t bringing me news,\u201d said Harry tonelessly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Aunt Petunia at once.\n\n\u201cNo more do I,\u201d said Uncle Vernon forcefully.\n\n\u201cWe know you\u2019re up to something funny,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not stupid, you know,\u201d said Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s news to me,\u201d said Harry, his temper rising, and before the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up the street.\n\nHe was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind.\n\nHarry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to become invisible . . .\n\nHe walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt Petunia\u2019s dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn\u2019t they spoken to him, why hadn\u2019t they made contact, why were they hiding now?\n\nAnd then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked away.\n\nPerhaps it hadn\u2019t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises. Could he be sure it hadn\u2019t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor\u2019s house?\n\nHarry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and, before he knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again . . .\n\nTomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five o\u2019clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily Prophet \u2014 but was there any point in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days; when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry cared about.\n\nIf he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say much about you-know-what, obviously. . . .\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray. . . .\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re quite busy but I can\u2019t give you details here. . . .\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a fair amount going on, we\u2019ll tell you everything when we see you. . . .\u201d\n\nBut when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled, \u201cI expect we\u2019ll be seeing you quite soon\u201d inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron\u2019s parents\u2019 house. He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry at them that he had thrown both their birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this after eating the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.\n\nAnd what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn\u2019t he, Harry, busy? Hadn\u2019t he proved himself capable of handling much more than they? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn\u2019t it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed . . . ?\n\nDon\u2019t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments too.\n\nHe turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione\u2019s, but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints:\n\n\u201cI know this must be frustrating for you. . . .\u201d \u201cKeep your nose clean and everything will be okay. . . .\u201d \u201cBe careful and don\u2019t do anything rash. . . .\u201d\n\nWell, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had (by and large) done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the Burrow by himself. In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff . . .\n\nHarry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys\u2019 flower bed again. Tomorrow he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting anymore . . . In the past his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected . . . Nothing to worry about . . . old news . . .\n\nThe injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury. If it hadn\u2019t been for him, nobody would even have known Voldemort was back! And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along too? How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry\u2019s head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings.\n\nHe did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling along.\n\nHarry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang.\n\nDudley was as vast as ever, but a year\u2019s hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of the Southeast. \u201cThe noble sport,\u201d as Uncle Vernon called it, had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry in the primary school days when he had served as Dudley\u2019s first punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore but he still didn\u2019t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all around were terrified of him \u2014 even more terrified than they were of \u201cthat Potter boy,\u201d who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended St. Brutus\u2019s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.\n\nHarry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered whom they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found himself thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I\u2019m sitting here all alone. . . . Come and have a go. . . .\n\nIf Dudley\u2019s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He wouldn\u2019t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he\u2019d be terrified of provoking Harry . . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley\u2019s dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond . . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready \u2014 he had his wand . . . let them try . . . He\u2019d love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell \u2014\n\nBut they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them. . . . Seeking a fight was not a smart move . . . He must not use magic . . . He would be risking expulsion again . . .\n\nDudley\u2019s gang\u2019s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along Magnolia Road.\n\nThere you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you\u2019d have done . . .\n\nHe got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the park gate.\n\nMagnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon\u2019s. Harry preferred Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his \u201cdelinquent\u201d appearance when he passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley\u2019s gang came into view again; they were saying their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.\n\n\u201c. . . squealed like a pig, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Malcolm was saying, to guffaws from the others.\n\n\u201cNice right hook, Big D,\u201d said Piers.\n\n\u201cSame time tomorrow?\u201d said Dudley.\n\n\u201cRound at my place, my parents are out,\u201d said Gordon.\n\n\u201cSee you then,\u201d said Dudley.\n\n\u201cBye Dud!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee ya, Big D!\u201d\n\nHarry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming tunelessly.\n\n\u201cHey, Big D!\u201d\n\nDudley turned.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he grunted. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been \u2018Big D\u2019 then?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cShut it,\u201d snarled Dudley, turning away again.\n\n\u201cCool name,\u201d said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his cousin. \u201cBut you\u2019ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, SHUT IT!\u201d said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t the boys know that\u2019s what your mum calls you?\u201d\n\n\u201cShut your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t tell her to shut her face. What about \u2018popkin\u2019 and \u2018Dinky Diddydums,\u2019 can I use them then?\u201d\n\nDudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control.\n\n\u201cSo who\u2019ve you been beating up tonight?\u201d Harry asked, his grin fading. \u201cAnother ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was asking for it,\u201d snarled Dudley.\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe cheeked me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? Did he say you look like a pig that\u2019s been taught to walk on its hind legs? \u2019Cause that\u2019s not cheek, Dud, that\u2019s true . . .\u201d\n\nA muscle was twitching in Dudley\u2019s jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had.\n\nThey turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other.\n\n\u201cThink you\u2019re a big man carrying that thing, don\u2019t you?\u201d Dudley said after a few seconds.\n\n\u201cWhat thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat \u2014 that thing you\u2019re hiding.\u201d\n\nHarry grinned again.\n\n\u201cNot as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s\u2019pose if you were, you wouldn\u2019t be able to walk and talk at the same time . . .\u201d\n\nHarry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed,\u201d Dudley said at once. \u201cI know you\u2019re not. You\u2019d get expelled from that freak school you go to.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know they haven\u2019t changed the rules, Big D?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t,\u201d said Dudley, though he didn\u2019t sound completely convinced. Harry laughed softly.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have you?\u201d Dudley snarled.\n\n\u201cWhereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was sixteen for your information,\u201d snarled Dudley, \u201cand he was out cold for twenty minutes after I\u2019d finished with him and he was twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing out \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRunning to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry\u2019s wand?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot this brave at night, are you?\u201d sneered Dudley.\n\n\u201cThis is night, Diddykins. That\u2019s what we call it when it goes all dark like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean when you\u2019re in bed!\u201d Dudley snarled.\n\nHe had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin. From the little he could see of Dudley\u2019s large face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant look.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, I\u2019m not brave in bed?\u201d said Harry, completely nonplussed. \u201cWhat \u2014 am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard you last night,\u201d said Dudley breathlessly. \u201cTalking in your sleep. Moaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams.\n\nDudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched, whimpering voice. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t kill Cedric! Don\u2019t kill Cedric!\u2019 Who\u2019s Cedric \u2014 your boyfriend?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 you\u2019re lying \u2014\u201d said Harry automatically. But his mouth had gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn\u2019t lying \u2014 how else would he know about Cedric?\n\n\u201c\u2018Dad! Help me, Dad! He\u2019s going to kill me, Dad! Boo-hoo!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cShut up, Dudley, I\u2019m warning you!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He\u2019s killed Cedric! Dad, help me! He\u2019s going to \u2014\u2019 Don\u2019t you point that thing at me!\u201d\n\nDudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley\u2019s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years\u2019 hatred of Dudley pounding in his veins \u2014 what wouldn\u2019t he give to strike now, to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he\u2019d have to crawl home like an insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers \u2014\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever talk about that again,\u201d Harry snarled. \u201cD\u2019you understand me?\u201d\n\n\u201cPoint that thing somewhere else!\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, do you understand me?\u201d\n\n\u201cPoint it somewhere else!\u201d\n\n\u201cDO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?\u201d\n\n\u201cGET THAT THING AWAY FROM \u2014\u201d\n\nDudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been doused in icy water.\n\nSomething had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch-black and lightless \u2014 the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.\n\nFor a split second Harry thought he had done magic without meaning to, despite the fact that he\u2019d been resisting as hard as he could \u2014 then his reason caught up with his senses \u2014 he didn\u2019t have the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that, trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil.\n\nDudley\u2019s terrified voice broke in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cW-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything! Shut up and don\u2019t move!\u201d\n\n\u201cI c-can\u2019t see! I\u2019ve g-gone blind! I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI said shut up!\u201d\n\nHarry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The cold was so intense that he was shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up \u2014 he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly around, unseeing . . .\n\nIt was impossible . . . They couldn\u2019t be here . . . Not in Little Whinging . . . He strained his ears . . . He would hear them before he saw them . . .\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll t-tell Dad!\u201d Dudley whimpered. \u201cW-where are you? What are you d-do \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you shut up?\u201d Harry hissed, \u201cI\u2019m trying to lis \u2014\u201d\n\nBut he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been dreading.\n\nThere was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.\n\n\u201cC-cut it out! Stop doing it! I\u2019ll h-hit you, I swear I will!\u201d\n\n\u201cDudley, shut \u2014\u201d\n\nWHAM!\n\nA fist made contact with the side of Harry\u2019s head, lifting Harry off his feet. Small white lights popped in front of Harry\u2019s eyes; for the second time in an hour he felt as though his head had been cleaved in two; next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and his wand had flown out of his hand.\n\n\u201cYou moron, Dudley!\u201d Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain, as he scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley fence, stumbling.\n\n\u201cDUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU\u2019RE RUNNING RIGHT AT IT!\u201d\n\nThere was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley\u2019s footsteps stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only one thing. There was more than one.\n\n\u201cDUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!\u201d Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. \u201cWhere\u2019s \u2014 wand \u2014 come on \u2014 Lumos!\u201d\n\nHe said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in his search \u2014 and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his right hand \u2014 the wand-tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned around.\n\nHis stomach turned over.\n\nA towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him, hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes, sucking on the night as it came.\n\nStumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.\n\n\u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d\n\nA silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn\u2019t worked properly; tripping over his feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him, panic fogging his brain \u2014 concentrate \u2014\n\nA pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor\u2019s robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry\u2019s ears.\n\n\u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d\n\nHis voice sounded dim and distant . . . Another wisp of silver smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand \u2014 he couldn\u2019t do it anymore, he couldn\u2019t work the spell \u2014\n\nThere was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter . . . He could smell the dementor\u2019s putrid, death-cold breath, filling his own lungs, drowning him \u2014 Think . . . something happy. . . .\n\nBut there was no happiness in him . . . The dementor\u2019s icy fingers were closing on his throat \u2014 the high-pitched laughter was growing louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head \u2014 \u201cBow to death, Harry. . . . It might even be painless . . . I would not know . . . I have never died . . .\u201d\n\nHe was never going to see Ron and Hermione again \u2014\n\nAnd their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breath \u2014\n\n\u201cEXPECTO PATRONUM!\u201d\n\nAn enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry\u2019s wand; its antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.\n\n\u201cTHIS WAY!\u201d Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. \u201cDUDLEY? DUDLEY!\u201d\n\nHe had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head toward Dudley\u2019s face as though about to kiss him . . .\n\n\u201cGET IT!\u201d Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The dementor\u2019s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley\u2019s when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.\n\nMoon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to normality. After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat.\n\nHe could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in Little Whinging . . .\n\nDudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking. Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.\n\nMrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight, but \u2014\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put it away, idiot boy!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cWhat if there are more of them around? Oh, I\u2019m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter2": "A PECK OF OWLS\n\n\n\n\nWhat?\u201d said Harry blankly.\n\n\u201cHe left!\u201d said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. \u201cLeft to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom! I told him I\u2019d flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It\u2019s just lucky I put Mr. Tibbles on the case! But we haven\u2019t got time to stand around! Hurry, now, we\u2019ve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble this is going to cause! I will kill him!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\nThe revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re a witch?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was I supposed to help you fight off dementors? He left you completely without cover when I warned him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang on \u2014 it was him! He Disapparated from the front of my house!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, yes, but luckily I\u2019d stationed Mr. Tibbles under a car just in case, and Mr. Tibbles came and warned me, but by the time I got to your house you\u2019d gone \u2014 and now \u2014 oh, what\u2019s Dumbledore going to say? You!\u201d she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor. \u201cGet your fat bottom off the ground, quick!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know Dumbledore?\u201d said Harry, staring at her.\n\n\u201cOf course I know Dumbledore, who doesn\u2019t know Dumbledore? But come on \u2014 I\u2019ll be no help if they come back, I\u2019ve never so much as Transfigured a teabag \u2014\u201d\n\nShe stooped down, seized one of Dudley\u2019s massive arms in her wizened hands, and tugged.\n\n\u201cGet up, you useless lump, get up!\u201d\n\nBut Dudley either could not or would not move. He was still on the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Harry took hold of Dudley\u2019s arm and heaved: With an enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet. Dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go of him he swayed dangerously.\n\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d said Mrs. Figg hysterically.\n\nHarry pulled one of Dudley\u2019s massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under his weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously around the corner.\n\n\u201cKeep your wand out,\u201d she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria Walk. \u201cNever mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there\u2019s going to be hell to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery . . . This was exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of \u2014 what\u2019s that at the end of the street? Oh, it\u2019s just Mr. Prentice. . . . Don\u2019t put your wand away, boy, don\u2019t I keep telling you I\u2019m no use?\u201d\n\nIt was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry Dudley along at the same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He was slumped on Harry\u2019s shoulder, his large feet dragging along the ground.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019re a Squib?\u201d Harry asked Mrs. Figg, panting with the effort to keep walking. \u201cAll those times I came round your house \u2014 why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young. I\u2019m sorry I gave you such a miserable time, but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they\u2019d thought you enjoyed it. It wasn\u2019t easy, you know. . . . But oh my word,\u201d she said tragically, wringing her hands once more, \u201cwhen Dumbledore hears about this \u2014 how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be on duty until midnight \u2014 where is he? How am I going to tell Dumbledore what\u2019s happened, I can\u2019t Apparate \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an owl, you can borrow her,\u201d Harry groaned, wondering whether his spine was going to snap under Dudley\u2019s weight.\n\n\u201cHarry, you don\u2019t understand! Dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible, the Ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic, they\u2019ll know already, you mark my words \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use magic \u2014 they\u2019re going to be more worried what dementors were doing floating around Wisteria Walk, surely?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my dear, I wish it were so but I\u2019m afraid \u2014 MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!\u201d\n\nThere was a loud crack and a strong smell of mingled drink and stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialized right in front of them. He had short bandy legs, long straggly ginger hair, and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound; he was also clutching a silvery bundle that Harry recognized at once as an Invisibility Cloak.\n\n\u201c\u2019S\u2019 up, Figgy?\u201d he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dudley. \u201cWhat \u2019appened to staying undercover?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you undercover!\u201d cried Mrs. Figg. \u201cDementors, you useless, skiving sneak thief!\u201d\n\n\u201cDementors?\u201d repeated Mundungus, aghast. \u201cDementors here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!\u201d shrieked Mrs. Figg. \u201cDementors attacking the boy on your watch!\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to Harry and back again. \u201cBlimey, I . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn\u2019t I tell you not to go? Didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 well, I \u2014\u201d Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. \u201cIt . . . it was a very good business opportunity, see . . .\u201d\n\nMrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.\n\n\u201cOuch \u2014 gerroff \u2014 gerroff, you mad old bat! Someone\u2019s gotta tell Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 they \u2014 have!\u201d yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach. \u201cAnd \u2014 it \u2014 had \u2014 better \u2014 be \u2014 you \u2014 and \u2014 you \u2014 can \u2014 tell \u2014 him \u2014 why \u2014 you \u2014 weren\u2019t \u2014 there \u2014 to \u2014 help!\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your \u2019airnet on!\u201d said Mundungus, his arms over his head, cowering. \u201cI\u2019m going, I\u2019m going!\u201d\n\nAnd with another loud crack, he vanished.\n\n\u201cI hope Dumbledore murders him!\u201d said Mrs. Figg furiously. \u201cNow come on, Harry, what are you waiting for?\u201d\n\nHarry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under Dudley\u2019s bulk. He gave the semiconscious Dudley a heave and staggered onward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the door,\u201d said Mrs. Figg, as they turned into Privet Drive. \u201cJust in case there are more of them around. . . . Oh my word, what a catastrophe . . . and you had to fight them off yourself . . . and Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs. . . . Well, it\u2019s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose . . . but the cat\u2019s among the pixies now . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Harry panted, \u201cDumbledore\u2019s . . . been having . . . me followed?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he has,\u201d said Mrs. Figg impatiently. \u201cDid you expect him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent. . . . Right . . . get inside and stay there,\u201d she said as they reached number four. \u201cI expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d asked Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going straight home,\u201d said Mrs. Figg, staring around the dark street and shuddering. \u201cI\u2019ll need to wait for more instructions. Just stay in the house. Good night.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on, don\u2019t go yet! I want to know \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping, string bag clanking.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Harry shouted after her; he had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with Dumbledore; but within seconds Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number four\u2019s garden path.\n\nThe hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia\u2019s outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door.\n\n\u201cDiddy! About time too, I was getting quite \u2014 quite \u2014 Diddy, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nHarry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time. Dudley swayed for a moment on the spot, his face pale green, then he opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the doormat.\n\n\u201cDIDDY! Diddy, what\u2019s the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus mustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated. He hurried forward to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ill, Vernon!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, son? What\u2019s happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you something foreign for tea?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on the ground?\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on \u2014 you haven\u2019t been mugged, have you, son?\u201d\n\nAunt Petunia screamed.\n\n\u201cPhone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak to Mummy! What did they do to you?\u201d\n\nIn all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which suited him perfectly. He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and while the Dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and quietly toward the stairs.\n\n\u201cWho did it, son? Give us names. We\u2019ll get them, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cShh! He\u2019s trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? Tell Mummy!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his voice.\n\n\u201cHim.\u201d\n\nHarry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the explosion.\n\n\u201cBOY! COME HERE!\u201d\n\nWith a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.\n\nThe scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he was still very green and clammy looking. Uncle Vernon was standing in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done to my son?\u201d he said in a menacing growl.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon wouldn\u2019t believe him.\n\n\u201cWhat did he do to you, Diddy?\u201d Aunt Petunia said in a quavering voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley\u2019s leather jacket. \u201cWas it \u2014 was it you-know-what, darling? Did he use \u2014 his thing?\u201d\n\nSlowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and Uncle Vernon raised his fists. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to him, it wasn\u2019t me, it was \u2014\u201d\n\nBut at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon\u2019s head, it soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at Harry\u2019s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside again and off across the garden.\n\n\u201cOWLS!\u201d bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. \u201cOWLS AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY HOUSE!\u201d\n\nBut Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his Adam\u2019s apple.\n\nDear Mr. Potter,\n\nWe have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle.\n\nThe severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.\n\nAs you have already received an official warning for a previous offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Wizards\u2019 Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic at 9 A.M. on August 12th.\n\nHoping you are well,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\nIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE\n\nMinistry of Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry read the letter through twice. He was only vaguely aware of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking in the vicinity. Inside his head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all over. He was never going back.\n\nHe looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced, shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dudley, who was retching again.\n\nHarry\u2019s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand. There was only one thing for it. He would have to run \u2014 now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn\u2019t know, but he was certain of one thing: At Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an almost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen.\n\n\u201cWhere d\u2019you think you\u2019re going?\u201d yelled Uncle Vernon. When Harry didn\u2019t reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished with you, boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of the way,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to stay here and explain how my son \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get out of the way I\u2019m going to jinx you,\u201d said Harry, raising the wand.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pull that one on me!\u201d snarled Uncle Vernon. \u201cI know you\u2019re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe madhouse has chucked me out,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSo I can do whatever I like. You\u2019ve got three seconds. One \u2014 two \u2014\u201d\n\nA resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia screamed, Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night Harry was staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made. He spotted it at once: A dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed window.\n\nIgnoring Uncle Vernon\u2019s anguished yell of \u201cOWLS!\u201d Harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled off the letter. Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.\n\nHarry \u2014\n\nDumbledore\u2019s just arrived at the Ministry, and he\u2019s trying to sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE\u2019S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC. DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND.\n\n\n\n\n\nDumbledore was trying to sort it all out. . . . What did that mean? How much power did Dumbledore have to override the Ministry of Magic? Was there a chance that he might be allowed back to Hogwarts, then? A small shoot of hope burgeoned in Harry\u2019s chest, almost immediately strangled by panic \u2014 how was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic? He\u2019d have to duel with the Ministry representatives, and if he did that, he\u2019d be lucky to escape Azkaban, let alone expulsion.\n\nHis mind was racing. . . . He could run for it and risk being captured by the Ministry, or stay put and wait for them to find him here. He was much more tempted by the former course, but he knew that Mr. Weasley had his best interests at heart . . . and, after all, Dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before. . . .\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Harry said, \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind, I\u2019m staying.\u201d\n\nHe flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced Dudley and Aunt Petunia. The Dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind. Aunt Petunia glanced despairingly at Uncle Vernon. The vein in Uncle Vernon\u2019s purple temple was throbbing worse than ever.\n\n\u201cWho are all these ruddy owls from?\u201d he growled.\n\n\u201cThe first one was from the Ministry of Magic, expelling me,\u201d said Harry calmly; he was straining his ears to catch noises outside in case the Ministry representatives were approaching, and it was easier and quieter to answer Uncle Vernon\u2019s questions than to have him start raging and bellowing. \u201cThe second one was from my friend Ron\u2019s dad, he works at the Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMinistry of Magic?\u201d bellowed Uncle Vernon. \u201cPeople like you in government? Oh this explains everything, everything, no wonder the country\u2019s going to the dogs . . .\u201d\n\nWhen Harry did not respond, Uncle Vernon glared at him, then spat, \u201cAnd why have you been expelled?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I did magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAHA!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, slamming his fist down on the top of the fridge, which sprang open; several of Dudley\u2019s low-fat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor. \u201cSo you admit it! What did you do to Dudley?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry, slightly less calmly. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWas,\u201d muttered Dudley unexpectedly, and Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia instantly made flapping gestures at Harry to quiet him while they both bent low over Dudley.\n\n\u201cGo on, son,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cwhat did he do?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell us, darling,\u201d whispered Aunt Petunia.\n\n\u201cPointed his wand at me,\u201d Dudley mumbled.\n\n\u201cYeah, I did, but I didn\u2019t use \u2014\u201d Harry began angrily, but . . .\n\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia in unison. \u201cGo on, son,\u201d repeated Uncle Vernon, mustache blowing about furiously.\n\n\u201cAll dark,\u201d Dudley said hoarsely, shuddering. \u201cEverything dark. And then I h-heard . . . things. Inside m-my head . . .\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror. If their least favorite thing in the world was magic, closely followed by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban, people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of things did you hear, popkin?\u201d breathed Aunt Petunia, very white-faced and with tears in her eyes.\n\nBut Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life. . . . What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to hear?\n\n\u201cHow come you fell over, son?\u201d said Uncle Vernon in an unnaturally quiet voice, the kind of voice he would adopt at the bedside of a very ill person.\n\n\u201cT-tripped,\u201d said Dudley shakily. \u201cAnd then \u2014\u201d\n\nHe gestured at his massive chest. Harry understood: Dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you.\n\n\u201cHorrible,\u201d croaked Dudley. \u201cCold. Really cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Uncle Vernon in a voice of forced calm, while Aunt Petunia laid an anxious hand on Dudley\u2019s forehead to feel his temperature. \u201cWhat happened then, Dudders?\u201d\n\n\u201cFelt . . . felt . . . felt . . . as if . . . as if . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAs if you\u2019d never be happy again,\u201d Harry supplied tonelessly.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dudley whispered, still trembling.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up. \u201cSo you put some crackpot spell on my son so he\u2019d hear voices and believe he was \u2014 was doomed to misery, or something, did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you?\u201d said Harry, temper and voice rising together. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me! It was a couple of dementors!\u201d\n\n\u201cA couple of \u2014 what\u2019s this codswallop?\u201d\n\n\u201cDe \u2014 men \u2014 tors,\u201d said Harry slowly and clearly. \u201cTwo of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what the ruddy hell are dementors?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey guard the wizard prison, Azkaban,\u201d said Aunt Petunia.\n\nTwo seconds\u2019 ringing silence followed these words and then Aunt Petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word. Uncle Vernon was goggling at her. Harry\u2019s brain reeled. Mrs. Figg was one thing \u2014 but Aunt Petunia?\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know that?\u201d he asked her, astonished.\n\nAunt Petunia looked quite appalled with herself. She glanced at Uncle Vernon in fearful apology, then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsey teeth.\n\n\u201cI heard \u2014 that awful boy \u2014 telling her about them \u2014 years ago,\u201d she said jerkily.\n\n\u201cIf you mean my mum and dad, why don\u2019t you use their names?\u201d said Harry loudly, but Aunt Petunia ignored him. She seemed horribly flustered.\n\nHarry was stunned. Except for one outburst years ago, in the course of which Aunt Petunia had screamed that Harry\u2019s mother had been a freak, he had never heard her mention her sister. He was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long, when she usually put all her energies into pretending it didn\u2019t exist.\n\nUncle Vernon opened his mouth, closed it again, opened it once more, shut it, then, apparently struggling to remember how to talk, opened it for a third time and croaked, \u201cSo \u2014 so \u2014 they \u2014 er \u2014 they \u2014 er \u2014 they actually exist, do they \u2014 er \u2014 dementy-whatsits?\u201d\n\nAunt Petunia nodded.\n\nUncle Vernon looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout \u201cApril Fool!\u201d When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright. Harry tore a second official-looking envelope from the owl\u2019s beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night.\n\n\u201cEnough \u2014 effing \u2014 owls . . .\u201d muttered Uncle Vernon distractedly, stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again.\n\nDear Mr. Potter,\n\nFurther to our letter of approximately twenty-two minutes ago, the Ministry of Magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith. You may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on 12th August, at which time an official decision will be taken.\n\nFollowing discussions with the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time. You should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further inquiries.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n\nIMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE\n\nMinistry of Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry read this letter through three times in quick succession. The miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that he was not definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of August.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Uncle Vernon, recalling Harry to his surroundings. \u201cWhat now? Have they sentenced you to anything? Do your lot have the death penalty?\u201d he added as a hopeful afterthought.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go to a hearing,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ll sentence you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t give up hope, then,\u201d said Uncle Vernon nastily.\n\n\u201cWell, if that\u2019s all,\u201d said Harry, getting to his feet. He was desperate to be alone, to think, perhaps to send a letter to Ron, Hermione, or Sirius.\n\n\u201cNO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!\u201d bellowed Uncle Vernon. \u201cSIT BACK DOWN!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said Harry impatiently.\n\n\u201cDUDLEY!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon. \u201cI want to know exactly what happened to my son!\u201d\n\n\u201cFINE!\u201d yelled Harry, and in his temper, red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand, still clutched in his hand. All three Dursleys flinched, looking terrified.\n\n\u201cDudley and I were in the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk,\u201d said Harry, speaking fast, fighting to control his temper. \u201cDudley thought he\u2019d be smart with me, I pulled out my wand but didn\u2019t use it. Then two dementors turned up \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what ARE dementoids?\u201d asked Uncle Vernon furiously. \u201cWhat do they DO?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you \u2014 they suck all the happiness out of you,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand if they get the chance, they kiss you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKiss you?\u201d said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly. \u201cKiss you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.\u201d\n\nAunt Petunia uttered a soft scream.\n\n\u201cHis soul? They didn\u2019t take \u2014 he\u2019s still got his \u2014\u201d\n\nShe seized Dudley by the shoulders and shook him, as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him.\n\n\u201cOf course they didn\u2019t get his soul, you\u2019d know if they had,\u201d said Harry, exasperated.\n\n\u201cFought \u2019em off, did you, son?\u201d said Uncle Vernon loudly, with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a plane he understood. \u201cGave \u2019em the old one-two, did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give a dementor the old one-two,\u201d said Harry through clenched teeth.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s he all right, then?\u201d blustered Uncle Vernon. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he all empty, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I used the Patronus \u2014\u201d\n\nWHOOSH. With a clattering, a whirring of wings, and a soft fall of dust, a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace.\n\n\u201cFOR GOD\u2019S SAKE!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon, pulling great clumps of hair out of his mustache, something he hadn\u2019t been driven to in a long time. \u201cI WILL NOT HAVE OWLS HERE, I WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS, I TELL YOU!\u201d\n\nBut Harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl\u2019s leg. He was so convinced that this letter had to be from Dumbledore, explaining everything \u2014 the dementors, Mrs. Figg, what the Ministry was up to, how he, Dumbledore, intended to sort everything out \u2014 that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see Sirius\u2019s handwriting. Ignoring Uncle Vernon\u2019s ongoing rant about owls and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney, Harry read Sirius\u2019s message.\n\n\n\nArthur\u2019s just told us what happened.\n\nDon\u2019t leave the house again, whatever you do.\n\n\n\nHarry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over, looking for the rest of the letter, but there was nothing there.\n\nAnd now his temper was rising again. Wasn\u2019t anybody going to say \u201cwell done\u201d for fighting off two dementors single-handedly? Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he\u2019d misbehaved and they were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much damage had been done.\n\n\u201c\u2014 a peck, I mean, pack of owls shooting in and out of my house and I won\u2019t have it, boy, I won\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop the owls coming,\u201d Harry snapped, crushing Sirius\u2019s letter in his fist.\n\n\u201cI want the truth about what happened tonight!\u201d barked Uncle Vernon. \u201cIf it was demenders who hurt Dudley, how come you\u2019ve been expelled? You did you-know-what, you\u2019ve admitted it!\u201d\n\nHarry took a deep, steadying breath. His head was beginning to ache again. He wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen, away from the Dursleys.\n\n\u201cI did the Patronus Charm to get rid of the dementors,\u201d he said, forcing himself to remain calm. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that works against them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what were dementoids doing in Little Whinging?\u201d said Uncle Vernon in tones of outrage.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d said Harry wearily. \u201cNo idea.\u201d\n\nHis head was pounding in the glare of the strip lighting now. His anger was ebbing away. He felt drained, exhausted. The Dursleys were all staring at him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \u201cIt\u2019s got something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? You\u2019ve got to be the only \u2014 the only \u2014\u201d Evidently he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say the word \u201cwizard.\u201d \u201cThe only you-know-what for miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why they were here . . .\u201d\n\nBut at these words of Uncle Vernon\u2019s, Harry\u2019s exhausted brain ground back into action. Why had the dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the dementors, had they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would?\n\n\u201cThese demembers guard some weirdos\u2019 prison?\u201d said Uncle Vernon, lumbering in the wake of Harry\u2019s train of thought.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\nIf only his head would stop hurting, if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think. . . .\n\n\u201cOho! They were coming to arrest you!\u201d said Uncle Vernon, with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion. \u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it, boy? You\u2019re on the run from the law!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m not,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head as though to scare off a fly, his mind racing now.\n\n\u201cThen why \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must have sent them,\u201d said Harry quietly, more to himself than to Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Who must have sent them?\u201d\n\n\u201cLord Voldemort,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like \u201cwizard,\u201d \u201cmagic,\u201d or \u201cwand,\u201d could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor.\n\n\u201cLord \u2014 hang on,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, his face screwed up, a look of dawning comprehension in his piggy eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that name . . . that was the one who . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMurdered my parents, yes,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s gone,\u201d said Uncle Vernon impatiently, without the slightest sign that the murder of Harry\u2019s parents might be a painful topic to anybody. \u201cThat giant bloke said so. He\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s back,\u201d said Harry heavily.\n\nIt felt very strange to be standing here in Aunt Petunia\u2019s surgically clean kitchen, beside the top-of-the-range fridge and the wide-screen television, and talking calmly of Lord Voldemort to Uncle Vernon. The arrival of the dementors in Little Whinging seemed to have caused a breach in the great, invisible wall that divided the relentlessly non-magical world of Privet Drive and the world beyond. Harry\u2019s two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside down: The Dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and Mrs. Figg knew Albus Dumbledore; dementors were soaring around Little Whinging and he might never go back to Hogwarts. Harry\u2019s head throbbed more painfully.\n\n\u201cBack?\u201d whispered Aunt Petunia.\n\nShe was looking at Harry as she had never looked at him before. And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother\u2019s sister. He could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment. All he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what Lord Voldemort being back might mean. Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sister\u2019s) were not narrowed in dislike or anger: They were wide and fearful. The furious pretense that Aunt Petunia had maintained all Harry\u2019s life \u2014 that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with Uncle Vernon \u2014 seemed to have fallen away.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said, talking directly to Aunt Petunia now. \u201cHe came back a month ago. I saw him.\u201d\n\nHer hands found Dudley\u2019s massive leather-clad shoulders and clutched them.\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, looking from his wife to Harry and back again, apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them. \u201cHang on. This Lord Voldything\u2019s back, you say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one who murdered your parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now he\u2019s sending dismembers after you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like it,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, looking from his white-faced wife to Harry and hitching up his trousers. He seemed to be swelling, his great purple face stretching before Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cWell, that settles it,\u201d he said, his shirt front straining as he inflated himself, \u201cyou can get out of this house, boy!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou heard me \u2014 OUT!\u201d Uncle Vernon bellowed, and even Aunt Petunia and Dudley jumped. \u201cOUT! OUT! I should\u2019ve done it years ago! Owls treating the place like a rest home, puddings exploding, half the lounge destroyed, Dudley\u2019s tail, Marge bobbing around on the ceiling, and that flying Ford Anglia \u2014 OUT! OUT! You\u2019ve had it! You\u2019re history! You\u2019re not staying here if some loony\u2019s after you, you\u2019re not endangering my wife and son, you\u2019re not bringing trouble down on us, if you\u2019re going the same way as your useless parents, I\u2019ve had it! OUT!\u201d\n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry, Mr. Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his left hand. Don\u2019t leave the house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE\u2019S HOUSE.\n\n\u201cYou heard me!\u201d said Uncle Vernon, bending forward now, so that his massive purple face came closer to Harry\u2019s, so that Harry actually felt flecks of spit hit his face. \u201cGet going! You were all keen to leave half an hour ago! I\u2019m right behind you! Get out and never darken our doorstep again! Why we ever kept you in the first place I don\u2019t know. Marge was right, it should have been the orphanage, we were too damn soft for our own good, thought we could squash it out of you, thought we could turn you normal, but you\u2019ve been rotten from the beginning, and I\u2019ve had enough \u2014 OWLS!\u201d\n\nThe fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech. Harry raised his hand to seize the letter, which was in a scarlet envelope, but it soared straight over his head, flying directly at Aunt Petunia, who let out a scream and ducked, her arms over her face. The owl dropped the red envelope on her head, turned, and flew straight up the chimney again.\n\nHarry darted forward to pick up the letter, but Aunt Petunia beat him to it.\n\n\u201cYou can open it if you like,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut I\u2019ll hear what it says anyway. That\u2019s a Howler.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet go of it, Petunia!\u201d roared Uncle Vernon. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it, it could be dangerous!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s addressed to me,\u201d said Aunt Petunia in a shaking voice. \u201cIt\u2019s addressed to me, Vernon, look! Mrs. Petunia Dursley, The Kitchen, Number Four, Privet Drive \u2014\u201d\n\nShe caught her breath, horrified. The red envelope had begun to smoke.\n\n\u201cOpen it!\u201d Harry urged her. \u201cGet it over with! It\u2019ll happen anyway \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014\u201d\n\nAunt Petunia\u2019s hand was trembling. She looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route, but too late \u2014 the envelope burst into flames. Aunt Petunia screamed and dropped it.\n\nAn awful voice filled the kitchen, echoing in the confined space, issuing from the burning letter on the table.\n\n\u201cREMEMBER MY LAST, PETUNIA.\u201d\n\n\n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she might faint. She sank into the chair beside Dudley, her face in her hands. The remains of the envelope smoldered into ash in the silence.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Uncle Vernon said hoarsely. \u201cWhat \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 Petunia?\u201d\n\nAunt Petunia said nothing. Dudley was staring stupidly at his mother, his mouth hanging open. The silence spiraled horribly. Harry was watching his aunt, utterly bewildered, his head throbbing fit to burst.\n\n\u201cPetunia, dear?\u201d said Uncle Vernon timidly. \u201cP-Petunia?\u201d\n\nShe raised her head. She was still trembling. She swallowed.\n\n\u201cThe boy \u2014 the boy will have to stay, Vernon,\u201d she said weakly.\n\n\u201cW-what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe stays,\u201d she said. She was not looking at Harry. She got to her feet again.\n\n\u201cHe . . . but Petunia . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we throw him out, the neighbors will talk,\u201d she said. She was regaining her usual brisk, snappish manner rapidly, though she was still very pale. \u201cThey\u2019ll ask awkward questions, they\u2019ll want to know where he\u2019s gone. We\u2019ll have to keep him.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon was deflating like an old tire.\n\n\u201cBut Petunia, dear \u2014\u201d\n\nAunt Petunia ignored him. She turned to Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re to stay in your room,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not to leave the house. Now get to bed.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cWho was that Howler from?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions,\u201d Aunt Petunia snapped.\n\n\u201cAre you in touch with wizards?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you to get to bed!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did it mean? Remember the last what?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to bed!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYOU HEARD YOUR AUNT, NOW GET TO BED!\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter3": "THE ADVANCE GUARD\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve just been attacked by dementors and I might be expelled from Hogwarts. I want to know what\u2019s going on and when I\u2019m going to get out of here.\n\nHarry copied these words onto three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom. He addressed the first to Sirius, the second to Ron, and the third to Hermione. His owl, Hedwig, was off hunting; her cage stood empty on the desk. Harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back, his head pounding, his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness. His back ached from carrying Dudley home, and the two lumps on his head where the window and Dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully.\n\nUp and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic \u2014 and still no one was telling him what was going on.\n\nAnd what, what, had that Howler been about? Whose voice had echoed so horribly, so menacingly, through the kitchen?\n\nWhy was he still trapped here without information? Why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid? Don\u2019t do any more magic, stay in the house. . . .\n\nHe kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body.\n\nJust as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost.\n\n\u201cAbout time!\u201d Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her cage. \u201cYou can put that down, I\u2019ve got work for you!\u201d\n\nHedwig\u2019s large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over the dead frog clamped in her beak.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. \u201cTake these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Hermione and don\u2019t come back here without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they\u2019ve written decent-length answers if you\u2019ve got to. Understand?\u201d\n\nHedwig gave a muffled hooting noise, beak still full of frog.\n\n\u201cGet going, then,\u201d said Harry.\n\nShe took off immediately. The moment she\u2019d gone, Harry threw himself down onto his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling. In addition to every other miserable feeling, he now felt guilty that he\u2019d been irritable with Hedwig; she was the only friend he had at number four, Privet Drive. But he\u2019d make it up to her when she came back with Sirius\u2019s, Ron\u2019s, and Hermione\u2019s answers.\n\nThey were bound to write back quickly; they couldn\u2019t possibly ignore a dementor attack. He\u2019d probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the Burrow. And with that comforting idea, sleep rolled over him, stifling all further thought.\n\n\nBut Hedwig didn\u2019t return next morning. Harry spent the day in his bedroom, leaving it only to go to the bathroom. Three times that day Aunt Petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap Uncle Vernon had installed three summers ago. Every time Harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the Howler, but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got. Otherwise the Dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom. Harry couldn\u2019t see the point of forcing his company on them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps making him so angry he\u2019d perform more illegal magic.\n\nSo it went on for three whole days. Harry was filled alternately with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything, during which he paced his bedroom again, furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess, and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time, staring dazedly into space, aching with dread at the thought of the Ministry hearing.\n\nWhat if they ruled against him? What if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half? What would he do, where would he go? He could not return to living full-time with the Dursleys, not now that he knew the other world, the one to which he really belonged. . . . Was it possible that he might be able to move into Sirius\u2019s house, as Sirius had suggested a year ago, before he had been forced to flee from the Ministry himself? Would he be allowed to live there alone, given that he was still underage? Or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him; had his breach of the International Statute of Secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in Azkaban? Whenever this thought occurred, Harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again.\n\nOn the fourth night after Hedwig\u2019s departure Harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases, staring at the ceiling, his exhausted mind quite blank, when his uncle entered his bedroom. Harry looked slowly around at him. Uncle Vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe \u2014 that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I \u2014 are going out.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Harry dully, looking back at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cYou are not to leave your bedroom while we are away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not to steal food from the fridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going to lock your door.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do that.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon glared at Harry, clearly suspicious of this lack of argument, then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him. Harry heard the key turn in the lock and Uncle Vernon\u2019s footsteps walking heavily down the stairs. A few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors, the rumble of an engine, and the unmistakable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive.\n\nHarry had no particular feeling about the Dursleys leaving. It made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not. He could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light. The room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time, waiting for the blessed moment when Hedwig returned.\n\nThe empty house creaked around him. The pipes gurgled. Harry lay there in a kind of stupor, thinking of nothing, suspended in misery.\n\nAnd then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below.\n\nHe sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn\u2019t heard their car.\n\nThere was silence for a few seconds, and then he heard voices.\n\nBurglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet \u2014 but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so.\n\nHe snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open.\n\nHarry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came. He hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs.\n\nHis heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could see, looking up at him.\n\n\u201cLower your wand, boy, before you take someone\u2019s eye out,\u201d said a low, growling voice.\n\nHarry\u2019s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, but he did not lower his wand.\n\n\u201cProfessor Moody?\u201d he said uncertainly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know so much about \u2018Professor,\u2019\u201d growled the voice, \u201cnever got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you properly.\u201d\n\nHarry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it, nor did he move. He had very good reason to be suspicious. He had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye Moody\u2019s company only to find out that it wasn\u2019t Moody at all, but an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before being unmasked. But before he could make a decision about what to do next, a second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Harry. We\u2019ve come to take you away.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart leapt. He knew that voice too, though he hadn\u2019t heard it for more than a year.\n\n\u201cP-Professor Lupin?\u201d he said disbelievingly. \u201cIs that you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are we all standing in the dark?\u201d said a third voice, this one completely unfamiliar, a woman\u2019s. \u201cLumos.\u201d\n\nA wand-tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look.\n\nRemus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when Harry had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to smile back through his shock.\n\n\u201cOooh, he looks just like I thought he would,\u201d said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet. \u201cWotcher, Harry!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I see what you mean, Remus,\u201d said a bald black wizard standing farthest back; he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear. \u201cHe looks exactly like James.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept the eyes,\u201d said a wheezy-voiced, silver-haired wizard at the back. \u201cLily\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nMad-Eye Moody, who had long grizzled gray hair and a large chunk missing from his nose, was squinting suspiciously at Harry through his mismatched eyes. One of the eyes was small, dark, and beady, the other large, round, and electric blue \u2014 the magical eye that could see through walls, doors, and the back of Moody\u2019s own head.\n\n\u201cAre you quite sure it\u2019s him, Lupin?\u201d he growled. \u201cIt\u2019d be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him. We ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know. Unless anyone brought any Veritaserum?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, what form does your Patronus take?\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cA stag,\u201d said Harry nervously.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him, Mad-Eye,\u201d said Lupin.\n\nHarry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring at him, stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put your wand there, boy!\u201d roared Moody. \u201cWhat if it ignited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho d\u2019you know who\u2019s lost a buttock?\u201d the violet-haired woman asked Mad-Eye interestedly.\n\n\u201cNever you mind, you just keep your wand out of your back pocket!\u201d growled Mad-Eye. \u201cElementary wand safety, nobody bothers about it anymore . . .\u201d He stumped off toward the kitchen. \u201cAnd I saw that,\u201d he added irritably, as the woman rolled her eyes at the ceiling.\n\nLupin held out his hand and shook Harry\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asked, looking at Harry closely.\n\n\u201cF-fine . . .\u201d\n\nHarry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in the house as though this were a long-standing arrangement. He glanced at the people surrounding Lupin; they were still gazing avidly at him. He felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2014 you\u2019re really lucky the Dursleys are out . . .\u201d he mumbled.\n\n\u201cLucky, ha!\u201d said the violet-haired woman. \u201cIt was me that lured them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they\u2019d been short-listed for the All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition. They\u2019re heading off to the prize-giving right now. . . . Or they think they are.\u201d\n\nHarry had a fleeting vision of Uncle Vernon\u2019s face when he realized there was no All-England Best-Kept Suburban Lawn Competition.\n\n\u201cWe are leaving, aren\u2019t we?\u201d he asked. \u201cSoon?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost at once,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cwe\u2019re just waiting for the all-clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are we going? The Burrow?\u201d Harry asked hopefully.\n\n\u201cNot the Burrow, no,\u201d said Lupin, motioning Harry toward the kitchen; the little knot of wizards followed, all still eyeing Harry curiously. \u201cToo risky. We\u2019ve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable. It\u2019s taken a while . . .\u201d\n\nMad-Eye Moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask, his magical eye spinning in all directions, taking in the Dursleys\u2019 many labor-saving appliances.\n\n\u201cThis is Alastor Moody, Harry,\u201d Lupin continued, pointing toward Moody.\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd to be introduced to somebody he\u2019d thought he\u2019d known for a year.\n\n\u201cAnd this is Nymphadora \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me Nymphadora, Remus,\u201d said the young witch with a shudder. \u201cIt\u2019s Tonks.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 Nymphadora Tonks, who prefers to be known by her surname only,\u201d finished Lupin.\n\n\u201cSo would you if your fool of a mother had called you \u2018Nymphadora,\u2019\u201d muttered Tonks.\n\n\u201cAnd this is Kingsley Shacklebolt\u201d \u2014 he indicated the tall black wizard, who bowed \u2014 \u201cElphias Doge\u201d \u2014 the wheezy-voiced wizard nodded \u2014 \u201cDedalus Diggle \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve met before,\u201d squeaked the excitable Diggle, dropping his top hat.\n\n\u201c\u2014 Emmeline Vance\u201d \u2014 a stately looking witch in an emerald-green shawl inclined her head \u2014 \u201cSturgis Podmore\u201d \u2014 a square-jawed wizard with thick, straw-colored hair winked \u2014 \u201cand Hestia Jones.\u201d A pink-cheeked, black-haired witch waved from next to the toaster.\n\nHarry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced. He wished they would look at something other than him; it was as though he had suddenly been ushered onstage. He also wondered why so many of them were there.\n\n\u201cA surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,\u201d said Lupin, as though he had read Harry\u2019s mind; the corners of his mouth twitched slightly.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, the more the better,\u201d said Moody darkly. \u201cWe\u2019re your guard, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for the signal to tell us it\u2019s safe to set off,\u201d said Lupin, glancing out of the kitchen window. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about fifteen minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery clean, aren\u2019t they, these Muggles?\u201d said the witch called Tonks, who was looking around the kitchen with great interest. \u201cMy dad\u2019s Muggle-born and he\u2019s a right old slob. I suppose it varies, just like with wizards?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLook\u201d \u2014 he turned back to Lupin \u2014 \u201cwhat\u2019s going on, I haven\u2019t heard anything from anyone, what\u2019s Vol \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nSeveral of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises; Dedalus Diggle dropped his hat again, and Moody growled, \u201cShut up!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not discussing anything here, it\u2019s too risky,\u201d said Moody, turning his normal eye on Harry; his magical eye remained pointing up at the ceiling. \u201cDamn it,\u201d he added angrily, putting a hand up to the magical eye, \u201cit keeps sticking \u2014 ever since that scum wore it \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink, he popped out his eye.\n\n\u201cMad-Eye, you do know that\u2019s disgusting, don\u2019t you?\u201d said Tonks conversationally.\n\n\u201cGet me a glass of water, would you, Harry?\u201d asked Moody.\n\nHarry crossed to the dishwasher, took out a clean glass, and filled it with water at the sink, still watched eagerly by the band of wizards. Their relentless staring was starting to annoy him.\n\n\u201cCheers,\u201d said Moody, when Harry handed him the glass. He dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down; the eye whizzed around, staring at them all in turn. \u201cI want three-hundred-and-sixty degrees visibility on the return journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re we getting \u2014 wherever we\u2019re going?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cBrooms,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cOnly way. You\u2019re too young to Apparate, they\u2019ll be watching the Floo Network, and it\u2019s more than our life\u2019s worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemus says you\u2019re a good flier,\u201d said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep voice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s excellent,\u201d said Lupin, who was checking his watch. \u201cAnyway, you\u2019d better go and get packed, Harry, we want to be ready to go when the signal comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come and help you,\u201d said Tonks brightly.\n\nShe followed Harry back into the hall and up the stairs, looking around with much curiosity and interest.\n\n\u201cFunny place,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s a bit too clean, d\u2019you know what I mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better,\u201d she added, as they entered Harry\u2019s bedroom and he turned on the light.\n\nHis room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house. Confined to it for four days in a very bad mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where he\u2019d tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside. Hedwig\u2019s cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell, and his trunk lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle clothes and wizard\u2019s robes that had spilled onto the floor around it.\n\nHarry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk. Tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door.\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think purple\u2019s really my color,\u201d she said pensively, tugging at a lock of spiky hair. \u201cD\u2019you think it makes me look a bit peaky?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014\u201d said Harry, looking up at her over the top of Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland.\n\n\u201cYeah, it does,\u201d said Tonks decisively. She screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she were struggling to remember something. A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.\n\n\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d said Harry, gaping at her as she opened her eyes again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Metamorphmagus,\u201d she said, looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions. \u201cIt means I can change my appearance at will,\u201d she added, spotting Harry\u2019s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her. \u201cI was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an Auror?\u201d said Harry, impressed. Being a Dark wizard catcher was the only career he\u2019d ever considered after Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Tonks, looking proud. \u201cKingsley is as well; he\u2019s a bit higher up than I am, though. I only qualified a year ago. Nearly failed on Stealth and Tracking, I\u2019m dead clumsy, did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?\u201d Harry asked her, straightening up, completely forgetting about packing.\n\nTonks chuckled.\n\n\u201cBet you wouldn\u2019t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?\u201d\n\nHer eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d Harry mumbled, turning away. He did not like people staring at his scar.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to learn the hard way, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Tonks. \u201cMetamorphmagi are really rare, they\u2019re born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance. . . . But we\u2019ve got to get going, Harry, we\u2019re supposed to be packing,\u201d she added guiltily, looking around at all the mess on the floor.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 yeah,\u201d said Harry, grabbing up a few more books.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, it\u2019ll be much quicker if I \u2014 pack!\u201d cried Tonks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping movement over the floor.\n\nBooks, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very neat,\u201d said Tonks, walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. \u201cMy mum\u2019s got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly \u2014 she even gets the socks to fold themselves \u2014 but I\u2019ve never mastered how she does it \u2014 it\u2019s a kind of flick \u2014\u201d\n\nShe flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry\u2019s socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess within.\n\n\u201cAh, well,\u201d said Tonks, slamming the trunk\u2019s lid shut, \u201cat least it\u2019s all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too \u2014 Scourgify \u2014\u201d She pointed her wand at Hedwig\u2019s cage; a few feathers and droppings vanished. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit better \u2014 I\u2019ve never quite got the hang of these sort of householdy spells. Right \u2014 got everything? Cauldron? Broom? Wow! A Firebolt?\u201d\n\nHer eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in Harry\u2019s right hand. It was his pride and joy, a gift from Sirius, an international standard broomstick.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m still riding a Comet Two Sixty,\u201d said Tonks enviously. \u201cAh well . . . wand still in your jeans? Both buttocks still on? Okay, let\u2019s go. Locomotor Trunk.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s trunk rose a few inches into the air. Holding her wand like a conductor\u2019s baton, Tonks made it hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them, Hedwig\u2019s cage in her left hand. Harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick.\n\nBack in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye, which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made Harry feel sick. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Lupin, looking up as Tonks and Harry entered. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about a minute, I think. We should probably get out into the garden so we\u2019re ready. Harry, I\u2019ve left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThat you\u2019re safe \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll just depress them.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and you\u2019ll see them next summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I have to?\u201d\n\nLupin smiled but made no answer.\n\n\u201cCome here, boy,\u201d said Moody gruffly, beckoning Harry toward him with his wand. \u201cI need to Disillusion you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to what?\u201d said Harry nervously.\n\n\u201cDisillusionment Charm,\u201d said Moody, raising his wand. \u201cLupin says you\u2019ve got an Invisibility Cloak, but it won\u2019t stay on while we\u2019re flying; this\u2019ll disguise you better. Here you go \u2014\u201d\n\nHe rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck.\n\n\u201cNice one, Mad-Eye,\u201d said Tonks appreciatively, staring at Harry\u2019s midriff.\n\nHarry looked down at his body, or rather, what had been his body, for it didn\u2019t look anything like his anymore. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Moody, unlocking the back door with his wand.\n\nThey all stepped outside onto Uncle Vernon\u2019s beautifully kept lawn.\n\n\u201cClear night,\u201d grunted Moody, his magical eye scanning the heavens. \u201cCould\u2019ve done with a bit more cloud cover. Right, you,\u201d he barked at Harry, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be flying in close formation. Tonks\u2019ll be right in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin\u2019ll be covering you from below. I\u2019m going to be behind you. The rest\u2019ll be circling us. We don\u2019t break ranks for anything, got me? If one of us is killed \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that likely?\u201d Harry asked apprehensively, but Moody ignored him.\n\n\u201c\u2014 the others keep flying, don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t break ranks. If they take out all of us and you survive, Harry, the rear guard are standing by to take over; keep flying east and they\u2019ll join you.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he\u2019ll think we\u2019re not taking this seriously,\u201d said Tonks, as she strapped Harry\u2019s trunk and Hedwig\u2019s cage into a harness hanging from her broom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just telling the boy the plan,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cOur job\u2019s to deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s going to die,\u201d said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep, calming voice.\n\n\u201cMount your brooms, that\u2019s the first signal!\u201d said Lupin sharply, pointing into the sky.\n\nFar, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars. Harry recognized them at once as wand sparks. He swung his right leg over his Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly, and felt it vibrating very slightly, as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more.\n\n\u201cSecond signal, let\u2019s go!\u201d said Lupin loudly, as more sparks, green this time, exploded high above them.\n\nHarry kicked off hard from the ground. The cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head. He felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he\u2019d been fantasizing about all summer, he was going home. . . . For a few glorious moments, all his problems seemed to recede into nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky.\n\n\u201cHard left, hard left, there\u2019s a Muggle looking up!\u201d shouted Moody from behind him. Tonks swerved and Harry followed her, watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom. \u201cWe need more height. . . . Give it another quarter of a mile!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes watered in the chill as they soared upward; he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps. Two of those tiny lights might belong to Uncle Vernon\u2019s car. . . . The Dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now, full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition . . . and Harry laughed aloud at the thought, though his voice was drowned by the flapping of the others\u2019 robes, the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage, the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air. He had not felt this alive in a month, or this happy. . . .\n\n\u201cBearing south!\u201d shouted Mad-Eye. \u201cTown ahead!\u201d\n\nThey soared right, so that they did not pass directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below.\n\n\u201cBear southeast and keep climbing, there\u2019s some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in!\u201d called Moody.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going through clouds!\u201d shouted Tonks angrily. \u201cWe\u2019ll get soaked, Mad-Eye!\u201d\n\nHarry was relieved to hear her say this; his hands were growing numb on the Firebolt\u2019s handle. He wished he had thought to put on a coat; he was starting to shiver.\n\nThey altered their course every now and then according to Mad-Eye\u2019s instructions. Harry\u2019s eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache. He could remember being this cold on a broom only once before, during the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff in his third year, which had taken place in a storm. The guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey. Harry lost track of time. He wondered how long they had been flying; it felt like an hour at least.\n\n\u201cTurning southwest!\u201d yelled Moody. \u201cWe want to avoid the motorway!\u201d\n\nHarry was now so chilled that he thought longingly for a moment of the snug, dry interiors of the cars streaming along below, then, even more longingly, of traveling by Floo powder; it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames. . . . Kingsley Shacklebolt swooped around him, bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight. . . . Now Emmeline Vance was on his right, her wand out, her head turning left and right . . . then she too swooped over him, to be replaced by Sturgis Podmore. . . .\n\n\u201cWe ought to double back for a bit, just to make sure we\u2019re not being followed!\u201d Moody shouted.\n\n\u201cARE YOU MAD, MAD-EYE?\u201d Tonks screamed from the front. \u201cWe\u2019re all frozen to our brooms! If we keep going off course we\u2019re not going to get there until next week! We\u2019re nearly there now!\u201d\n\n\u201cTime to start the descent!\u201d came Lupin\u2019s voice. \u201cFollow Tonks, Harry!\u201d\n\nHarry followed Tonks into a dive. They were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen, a huge, sprawling, crisscrossing mass, glittering in lines and grids, interspersed with patches of deepest black. Lower and lower they flew, until Harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps, chimneys, and television aerials. He wanted to reach the ground very much, though he felt sure that someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom.\n\n\u201cHere we go!\u201d called Tonks, and a few seconds later she had landed.\n\nHarry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square. Tonks was already unbuckling Harry\u2019s trunk. Shivering, Harry looked around. The grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming; some of them had broken windows, glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps, paint was peeling from many of the doors, and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Harry asked, but Lupin said quietly, \u201cIn a minute.\u201d\n\nMoody was rummaging in his cloak, his gnarled hands clumsy with cold.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d he muttered, raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it.\n\nThe nearest streetlamp went out with a pop. He clicked the unlighter again; the next lamp went out. He kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only light in the square came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead.\n\n\u201cBorrowed it from Dumbledore,\u201d growled Moody, pocketing the Put-Outer. \u201cThat\u2019ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window, see? Now, come on, quick.\u201d\n\nHe took Harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass, across the road, and onto the pavement. Lupin and Tonks followed, carrying Harry\u2019s trunk between them, the rest of the guard, all with their wands out, flanking them.\n\nThe muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house. A pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin-bags just inside the broken gate.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Moody muttered, thrusting a piece of parchment toward Harry\u2019s Disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it, so as to illuminate the writing. \u201cRead quickly and memorize.\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at the piece of paper. The narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar. It said:\n\nThe headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter4": "NUMBER TWELVE, GRIMMAULD PLACE\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the Order of the \u2014 ?\u201d Harry began.\n\n\u201cNot here, boy!\u201d snarled Moody. \u201cWait till we\u2019re inside!\u201d\n\nHe pulled the piece of parchment out of Harry\u2019s hand and set fire to it with his wand-tip. As the message curled into flames and floated to the ground, Harry looked around at the houses again. They were standing outside number eleven; he looked to the left and saw number ten; to the right, however, was number thirteen.\n\n\u201cBut where\u2019s \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThink about what you\u2019ve just memorized,\u201d said Lupin quietly.\n\nHarry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside hadn\u2019t even felt anything.\n\n\u201cCome on, hurry,\u201d growled Moody, prodding Harry in the back.\n\nHarry walked up the worn stone steps, staring at the newly materialized door. Its black paint was shabby and scratched. The silver door knocker was in the form of a twisted serpent. There was no keyhole or letterbox.\n\nLupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once. Harry heard many loud, metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter of a chain. The door creaked open.\n\n\u201cGet in quick, Harry,\u201d Lupin whispered. \u201cBut don\u2019t go far inside and don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d\n\nHarry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall. He could smell damp, dust, and a sweetish, rotting smell; the place had the feeling of a derelict building. He looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him, Lupin and Tonks carrying his trunk and Hedwig\u2019s cage. Moody was standing on the top step and releasing the balls of light the Put-Outer had stolen from the streetlamps; they flew back to their bulbs and the square beyond glowed momentarily with orange light before Moody limped inside and closed the front door, so that the darkness in the hall became complete.\n\n\u201cHere \u2014\u201d\n\nHe rapped Harry hard over the head with his wand; Harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the Disillusionment Charm must have lifted.\n\n\u201cNow stay still, everyone, while I give us a bit of light in here,\u201d Moody whispered.\n\nThe others\u2019 hushed voices were giving Harry an odd feeling of foreboding; it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying person. He heard a soft hissing noise and then old-fashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry heard something scuttling behind the baseboard. Both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpents.\n\nThere were hurried footsteps and Ron\u2019s mother, Mrs. Weasley, emerged from a door at the far end of the hall. She was beaming in welcome as she hurried toward them, though Harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry, it\u2019s lovely to see you!\u201d she whispered, pulling him into a rib-cracking hug before holding him at arm\u2019s length and examining him critically. \u201cYou\u2019re looking peaky; you need feeding up, but you\u2019ll have to wait a bit for dinner, I\u2019m afraid . . .\u201d\n\nShe turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently, \u201cHe\u2019s just arrived, the meeting\u2019s started . . .\u201d\n\nThe wizards behind Harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past Harry toward the door through which Mrs. Weasley had just come; Harry made to follow Lupin, but Mrs. Weasley held him back.\n\n\u201cNo, Harry, the meeting\u2019s only for members of the Order. Ron and Hermione are upstairs, you can wait with them until the meeting\u2019s over and then we\u2019ll have dinner. And keep your voice down in the hall,\u201d she added in an urgent whisper.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wake anything up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain later, I\u2019ve got to hurry, I\u2019m supposed to be at the meeting \u2014 I\u2019ll just show you where you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d\n\nPressing her finger to her lips, she led him on tiptoes past a pair of long, moth-eaten curtains, behind which Harry supposed there must be another door, and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll\u2019s leg, they started up the dark staircase, passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall. A closer look showed Harry that the heads belonged to house-elves. All of them had the same rather snoutlike nose.\n\nHarry\u2019s bewilderment deepened with every step he took. What on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the Darkest of wizards?\n\n\u201cMrs. Weasley, why \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I\u2019ve really got to dash,\u201d Mrs. Weasley whispered distractedly. \u201cThere\u201d \u2014 they had reached the second landing \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re the door on the right. I\u2019ll call you when it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nAnd she hurried off downstairs again.\n\nHarry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which was shaped like a serpent\u2019s head, and opened the door.\n\nHe caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy high-ceilinged, twin-bedded room, then there was a loud twittering noise, followed by an even louder shriek, and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair \u2014 Hermione had thrown herself onto him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat, while Ron\u2019s tiny owl, Pigwidgeon, zoomed excitedly round and round their heads.\n\n\u201cHARRY! Ron, he\u2019s here, Harry\u2019s here! We didn\u2019t hear you arrive! Oh, how are you? Are you all right? Have you been furious with us? I bet you have, I know our letters were useless \u2014 but we couldn\u2019t tell you anything, Dumbledore made us swear we wouldn\u2019t, oh, we\u2019ve got so much to tell you, and you\u2019ve got to tell us \u2014 the dementors! When we heard \u2014 and that Ministry hearing \u2014 it\u2019s just outrageous, I\u2019ve looked it all up, they can\u2019t expel you, they just can\u2019t, there\u2019s provision in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life-threatening situations \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLet him breathe, Hermione,\u201d said Ron, grinning, closing the door behind Harry. He seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart, making him taller and more gangly looking than ever, though the long nose, bright red hair, and freckles were the same.\n\nHermione, still beaming, let go of Harry, but before she could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cHedwig!\u201d\n\nThe snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as Harry stroked her feathers.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been in a right state,\u201d said Ron. \u201cPecked us half to death when she brought your last letters, look at this \u2014\u201d\n\nHe showed Harry the index finger of his right hand, which sported a half-healed but clearly deep cut.\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Harry said. \u201cSorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give them to you, mate,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHermione was going spare, she kept saying you\u2019d do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news, but Dumbledore made us \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 swear not to tell me,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYeah, Hermione\u2019s already said.\u201d\n\nThe warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach. All of a sudden \u2014 after yearning to see them for a solid month \u2014 he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone.\n\nThere was a strained silence in which Harry stroked Hedwig automatically, not looking at either of the others.\n\n\u201cHe seemed to think it was best,\u201d said Hermione rather breathlessly. \u201cDumbledore, I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. He noticed that her hands too bore the marks of Hedwig\u2019s beak and found that he was not at all sorry.\n\n\u201cI think he thought you were safest with the Muggles \u2014\u201d Ron began.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d said Harry, raising his eyebrows. \u201cHave either of you been attacked by dementors this summer?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no \u2014 but that\u2019s why he\u2019s had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed except him.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t work that well, though, did it?\u201d said Harry, doing his utmost to keep his voice even. \u201cHad to look after myself after all, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was so angry,\u201d said Hermione in an almost awestruck voice. \u201cDumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended. He was scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad he left,\u201d Harry said coldly. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you . . . aren\u2019t you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing?\u201d said Hermione quietly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry lied defiantly. He walked away from them, looking around, with Hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder, but this room was not likely to raise his spirits. It was dank and dark. A blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as Harry passed it he thought he heard someone lurking out of sight snigger.\n\n\u201cSo why\u2019s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark?\u201d Harry asked, still trying hard to keep his voice casual. \u201cDid you \u2014 er \u2014 bother to ask him at all?\u201d\n\nHe glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he was behaving just as they had feared he would. It did nothing to improve his temper.\n\n\u201cWe told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe did, mate. But he\u2019s really busy now, we\u2019ve only seen him twice since we came here and he didn\u2019t have much time, he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be intercepted \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe could still\u2019ve kept me informed if he\u2019d wanted to,\u201d Harry said shortly. \u201cYou\u2019re not telling me he doesn\u2019t know ways to send messages without owls.\u201d\n\nHermione glanced at Ron and then said, \u201cI thought that too. But he didn\u2019t want you to know anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he thinks I can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d said Harry, watching their expressions.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be thick,\u201d said Ron, looking highly disconcerted.\n\n\u201cOr that I can\u2019t take care of myself \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t think that!\u201d said Hermione anxiously.\n\n\u201cSo how come I have to stay at the Dursleys\u2019 while you two get to join in everything that\u2019s going on here?\u201d said Harry, the words tumbling over one another in a rush, his voice growing louder with every word. \u201cHow come you two are allowed to know everything that\u2019s going on \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not!\u201d Ron interrupted. \u201cMum won\u2019t let us near the meetings, she says we\u2019re too young \u2014\u201d\n\nBut before he knew it, Harry was shouting.\n\n\u201cSO YOU HAVEN\u2019T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! YOU\u2019VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN\u2019T YOU? YOU\u2019VE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I\u2019VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS\u2019 FOR A MONTH! AND I\u2019VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO\u2019VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT \u2014 WHO SAVED THE SORCERER\u2019S STONE? WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?\u201d\n\nEvery bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads.\n\n\u201cWHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!\u201d\n\nRon was standing there with his mouth half-open, clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say, while Hermione looked on the verge of tears.\n\n\u201cBUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT\u2019S GOING ON? WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT\u2019S BEEN HAPPENING?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, we wanted to tell you, we really did \u2014\u201d Hermione began.\n\n\u201cCAN\u2019T\u2019VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU\u2019D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he did \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFOUR WEEKS I\u2019VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT\u2019S BEEN GOING ON \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI SUPPOSE YOU\u2019VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVEN\u2019T YOU, ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, honest \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, we\u2019re really sorry!\u201d said Hermione desperately, her eyes now sparkling with tears. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right, Harry \u2014 I\u2019d be furious if it was me!\u201d\n\nHarry glared at her, still breathing deeply, then turned away from them again, pacing up and down. Hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe. There was a long pause, broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below Harry\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cWhat is this place anyway?\u201d he shot at Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cHeadquarters of the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d said Ron at once.\n\n\u201cIs anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret society,\u201d said Hermione quickly. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s in charge, he founded it. It\u2019s the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s in it?\u201d said Harry, coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets.\n\n\u201cQuite a few people \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 we\u2019ve met about twenty of them,\u201d said Ron, \u201cbut we think there are more . . .\u201d\n\nHarry glared at them.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d he demanded, looking from one to the other.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWell what?\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort!\u201d said Harry furiously, and both Ron and Hermione winced. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? What\u2019s he up to? Where is he? What are we doing to stop him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve told you, the Order don\u2019t let us in on their meetings,\u201d said Hermione nervously. \u201cSo we don\u2019t know the details \u2014 but we\u2019ve got a general idea \u2014\u201d she added hastily, seeing the look on Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cFred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey\u2019re really useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtendable \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cEars, yeah. Only we\u2019ve had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order \u2014\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201c\u2014 and some of them are standing guard over something,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey\u2019re always talking about guard duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been me, could it?\u201d said Harry sarcastically.\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Ron, with a look of dawning comprehension.\n\nHarry snorted. He walked around the room again, looking anywhere but at Ron and Hermione. \u201cSo what have you two been doing, if you\u2019re not allowed in meetings?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou said you\u2019d been busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have,\u201d said Hermione quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been decontaminating this house, it\u2019s been empty for ages and stuff\u2019s been breeding in here. We\u2019ve managed to clean out the kitchen, most of the bedrooms, and I think we\u2019re doing the drawing room tomo \u2014 AARGH!\u201d\n\nWith two loud cracks, Fred and George, Ron\u2019s elder twin brothers, had materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwig on top of the wardrobe.\n\n\u201cStop doing that!\u201d Hermione said weakly to the twins, who were as vividly red-haired as Ron, though stockier and slightly shorter.\n\n\u201cHello, Harry,\u201d said George, beaming at him. \u201cWe thought we heard your dulcet tones.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to bottle up your anger like that, Harry, let it all out,\u201d said Fred, also beaming. \u201cThere might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two passed your Apparation tests, then?\u201d asked Harry grumpily.\n\n\u201cWith distinction,\u201d said Fred, who was holding what looked like a piece of very long, flesh-colored string.\n\n\u201cIt would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cTime is Galleons, little brother,\u201d said Fred. \u201cAnyway, Harry, you\u2019re interfering with reception. Extendable Ears,\u201d he added in response to Harry\u2019s raised eyebrows, holding up the string, which Harry now saw was trailing out onto the landing. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to hear what\u2019s going on downstairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to be careful,\u201d said Ron, staring at the ear. \u201cIf Mum sees one of them again . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth the risk, that\u2019s a major meeting they\u2019re having,\u201d said Fred.\n\nThe door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared.\n\n\u201cOh hello, Harry!\u201d said Ron\u2019s younger sister, Ginny, brightly. \u201cI thought I heard your voice.\u201d\n\nTurning to Fred and George she said, \u201cIt\u2019s no go with the Extendable Ears, she\u2019s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know?\u201d said George, looking crestfallen.\n\n\u201cTonks told me how to find out,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cYou just chuck stuff at the door and if it can\u2019t make contact the door\u2019s been Imperturbed. I\u2019ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it, so there\u2019s no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap.\u201d\n\nFred heaved a deep sigh. \u201cShame. I really fancied finding out what old Snape\u2019s been up to.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape?\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cIs he here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said George, carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds; Fred and Ginny followed. \u201cGiving a report. Top secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cGit,\u201d said Fred idly.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on our side now,\u201d said Hermione reprovingly.\n\nRon snorted. \u201cDoesn\u2019t stop him being a git. The way he looks at us when he sees us . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBill doesn\u2019t like him either,\u201d said Ginny, as though that settled the matter.\n\nHarry was not sure his anger had abated yet; but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting. He sank onto the bed opposite the others.\n\n\u201cIs Bill here?\u201d he asked. \u201cI thought he was working in Egypt.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order,\u201d said Fred. \u201cHe says he misses the tombs, but,\u201d he smirked, \u201cthere are compensations . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember old Fleur Delacour?\u201d said George. \u201cShe\u2019s got a job at Gringotts to eemprove \u2019er Eeenglish \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and Bill\u2019s been giving her a lot of private lessons,\u201d sniggered Fred.\n\n\u201cCharlie\u2019s in the Order too,\u201d said George, \u201cbut he\u2019s still in Romania, Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie\u2019s trying to make contacts on his days off.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t Percy do that?\u201d Harry asked. The last he had heard, the third Weasley brother was working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation at the Ministry of Magic.\n\nAt these words all the Weasleys and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks.\n\n\u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,\u201d Ron told Harry in a tense voice.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause every time Percy\u2019s name\u2019s mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he\u2019s holding and Mum starts crying,\u201d Fred said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been awful,\u201d said Ginny sadly.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re well shut of him,\u201d said George with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cPercy and Dad had a row,\u201d said Fred. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Dad row with anyone like that. It\u2019s normally Mum who shouts . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the first week back after term ended,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe were about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he\u2019d been promoted.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d said Harry.\n\nThough he knew perfectly well that Percy was highly ambitious, Harry\u2019s impression was that Percy had not made a great success of his first job at the Ministry of Magic. Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort (not that the Ministry had believed that \u2014 they all thought that Mr. Crouch had gone mad).\n\n\u201cYeah, we were all surprised,\u201d said George, \u201cbecause Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch, there was an inquiry and everything. They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior. But you know Percy, Crouch left him in charge, he wasn\u2019t going to complain . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how come they promoted him?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we wondered,\u201d said Ron, who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that Harry had stopped yelling. \u201cHe came home really pleased with himself \u2014 even more pleased than usual if you can imagine that \u2014 and told Dad he\u2019d been offered a position in Fudge\u2019s own office. A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts \u2014 Junior Assistant to the Minister. He expected Dad to be all impressed, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly Dad wasn\u2019t,\u201d said Fred grimly.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody\u2019s having any contact with Dumbledore,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s name\u2019s mud with the Ministry these days, see,\u201d said Fred. \u201cThey all think he\u2019s just making trouble saying You-Know-Who\u2019s back.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who\u2019s in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cTrouble is, Fudge suspects Dad, he knows he\u2019s friendly with Dumbledore, and he\u2019s always thought Dad\u2019s a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s this got to do with Percy?\u201d asked Harry, confused.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family \u2014 and Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nHarry let out a low whistle.\n\n\u201cBet Percy loved that.\u201d\n\nRon laughed in a hollow sort of way.\n\n\u201cHe went completely berserk. He said \u2014 well, he said loads of terrible stuff. He said he\u2019s been having to struggle against Dad\u2019s lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad\u2019s got no ambition and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve always been \u2014 you know \u2014 not had a lot of money, I mean \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry in disbelief, as Ginny made a noise like an angry cat.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Ron in a low voice. \u201cAnd it got worse. He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and that he \u2014 Percy \u2014 knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn\u2019t belong to our family anymore. And he packed his bags the same night and left. He\u2019s living here in London now.\u201d\n\nHarry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of Ron\u2019s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things to Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cMum\u2019s been in a right state,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou know \u2014 crying and stuff. She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face. I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work \u2014 ignores him, I s\u2019pose.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Percy must know Voldemort\u2019s back,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn\u2019t risk everything without proof \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, your name got dragged into the row,\u201d said Ron, shooting Harry a furtive look. \u201cPercy said the only evidence was your word and . . . I dunno . . . he didn\u2019t think it was good enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cPercy takes the Daily Prophet seriously,\u201d said Hermione tartly, and the others all nodded.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Harry asked, looking around at them all. They were all regarding him warily.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t \u2014 haven\u2019t you been getting the Daily Prophet?\u201d Hermione asked nervously.\n\n\u201cYeah, I have!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHave you \u2014 er \u2014 been reading it thoroughly?\u201d Hermione asked still more anxiously.\n\n\u201cNot cover to cover,\u201d said Harry defensively. \u201cIf they were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldn\u2019t it!\u201d\n\nThe others flinched at the sound of the name. Hermione hurried on, \u201cWell, you\u2019d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they \u2014 um \u2014 they mention you a couple of times a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019d have seen \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot if you\u2019ve only been reading the front page, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about big articles. They just slip you in, like you\u2019re a standing joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite nasty, actually,\u201d said Hermione in a voice of forced calm. \u201cThey\u2019re just building on Rita\u2019s stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s not writing for them anymore, is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, she\u2019s kept her promise \u2014 not that she\u2019s got any choice,\u201d Hermione added with satisfaction. \u201cBut she laid the foundation for what they\u2019re trying to do now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is what?\u201d said Harry impatiently.\n\n\u201cOkay, you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, who was not likely to forget Rita Skeeter\u2019s stories about him in a hurry.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re writing about you as though you\u2019re this deluded, attention-seeking person who thinks he\u2019s a great tragic hero or something,\u201d said Hermione, very fast, as though it would be less unpleasant for Harry to hear these facts quickly. \u201cThey keep slipping in snide comments about you. If some far-fetched story appears they say something like \u2018a tale worthy of Harry Potter\u2019 and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it\u2019s \u2018let\u2019s hope he hasn\u2019t got a scar on his forehead or we\u2019ll be asked to worship him next \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to worship \u2014\u201d Harry began hotly.\n\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione quickly, looking frightened. \u201cI know, Harry. But you see what they\u2019re doing? They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe. Fudge is behind it, I\u2019ll bet anything. They want wizards on the street to think you\u2019re just some stupid boy who\u2019s a bit of a joke, who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask \u2014 I didn\u2019t want \u2014 Voldemort killed my parents!\u201d Harry spluttered. \u201cI got famous because he murdered my family but couldn\u2019t kill me! Who wants to be famous for that? Don\u2019t they think I\u2019d rather it\u2019d never \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know, Harry,\u201d said Ginny earnestly.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, they didn\u2019t report a word about the dementors attacking you,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cSomeone\u2019s told them to keep that quiet. That should\u2019ve been a really big story, out-of-control dementors. They haven\u2019t even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy \u2014 we thought they would, it would tie in so well with this image of you as some stupid show-off \u2014 we think they\u2019re biding their time until you\u2019re expelled, then they\u2019re really going to go to town \u2014 I mean, if you\u2019re expelled, obviously,\u201d she went on hastily, \u201cyou really shouldn\u2019t be, not if they abide by their own laws, there\u2019s no case against you.\u201d\n\nThey were back on the hearing and Harry did not want to think about it. He cast around for another change of subject, but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs.\n\n\u201cUh-oh.\u201d\n\nFred gave the Extendable Ear a hearty tug; there was another loud crack and he and George vanished. Seconds later, Mrs. Weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway.\n\n\u201cThe meeting\u2019s over, you can come down and have dinner now, everyone\u2019s dying to see you, Harry. And who\u2019s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door?\u201d\n\n\u201cCrookshanks,\u201d said Ginny unblushingly. \u201cHe loves playing with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, \u201cI thought it might have been Kreacher, he keeps doing odd things like that. Now don\u2019t forget to keep your voices down in the hall. Ginny, your hands are filthy, what have you been doing? Go and wash them before dinner, please . . .\u201d\n\nGinny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron and Hermione again. Both of them were watching him apprehensively, as though they feared that he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone. The sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed.\n\n\u201cLook . . .\u201d he muttered, but Ron shook his head, and Hermione said quietly, \u201cWe knew you\u2019d be angry, Harry, we really don\u2019t blame you, but you\u2019ve got to understand, we did try and persuade Dumbledore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Harry grudgingly.\n\nHe cast around for a topic to change the subject from Dumbledore \u2014 the very thought of him made Harry\u2019s insides burn with anger again.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Kreacher?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThe house-elf who lives here,\u201d said Ron. \u201cNutter. Never met one like him.\u201d\n\nHermione frowned at Ron.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a nutter, Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHis life\u2019s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother,\u201d said Ron irritably. \u201cIs that normal, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 well, if he is a bit strange, it\u2019s not his fault \u2014\u201d\n\nRon rolled his eyes at Harry.\n\n\u201cHermione still hasn\u2019t given up on spew \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018spew\u2019!\u201d said Hermione heatedly. \u201cIt\u2019s the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it\u2019s not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d said Ron. \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019m starving.\u201d\n\nHe led the way out of the door and onto the landing, but before they could descend the stairs \u2014 \u201cHold it!\u201d Ron breathed, flinging out an arm to stop Harry and Hermione walking any farther. \u201cThey\u2019re still in the hall, we might be able to hear something \u2014\u201d\n\nThe three of them looked cautiously over the banisters. The gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards, including all of Harry\u2019s guard. They were whispering excitedly together. In the very center of the group Harry saw the dark, greasy-haired head and prominent nose of his least favorite teacher at Hogwarts, Professor Snape. Harry leaned farther over the banisters. He was very interested in what Snape was doing for the Order of the Phoenix. . . .\n\nA thin piece of flesh-colored string descended in front of Harry\u2019s eyes. Looking up he saw Fred and George on the landing above, cautiously lowering the Extendable Ear toward the dark knot of people below. A moment later, however, they began to move toward the front door and out of sight.\n\n\u201cDammit,\u201d Harry heard Fred whisper, as he hoisted the Extendable Ear back up again.\n\nThey heard the front door open and then close.\n\n\u201cSnape never eats here,\u201d Ron told Harry quietly. \u201cThank God. C\u2019mon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to keep your voice down in the hall, Harry,\u201d Hermione whispered.\n\nAs they passed the row of house-elf heads on the wall they saw Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, and Tonks at the front door, magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just left.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re eating down in the kitchen,\u201d Mrs. Weasley whispered, meeting them at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cHarry, dear, if you\u2019ll just tiptoe across the hall, it\u2019s through this door here \u2014\u201d\n\nCRASH.\n\n\u201cTonks!\u201d cried Mrs. Weasley exasperatedly, turning to look behind her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d wailed Tonks, who was lying flat on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s that stupid umbrella stand, that\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve tripped over \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible, earsplitting, bloodcurdling screech.\n\nThe moth-eaten velvet curtains Harry had passed earlier had flown apart, but there was no door behind them. For a split second, Harry thought he was looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she was being tortured \u2014 then he realized it was simply a life-size portrait, but the most realistic, and the most unpleasant, he had ever seen in his life.\n\nThe old woman was drooling, her eyes were rolling, the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed, and all along the hall behind them, the other portraits awoke and began to yell too, so that Harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his ears.\n\nLupin and Mrs. Weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman, but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever, brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their faces.\n\n\u201cFilth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers \u2014\u201d\n\nTonks apologized over and over again, at the same time dragging the huge, heavy troll\u2019s leg back off the floor. Mrs. Weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall, Stunning all the other portraits with her wand. Then a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry.\n\n\u201cShut up, you horrible old hag, shut UP!\u201d he roared, seizing the curtain Mrs. Weasley had abandoned.\n\nThe old woman\u2019s face blanched.\n\n\u201cYoooou!\u201d she howled, her eyes popping at the sight of the man. \u201cBlood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh!\u201d\n\n\u201cI said \u2014 shut \u2014 UP!\u201d roared the man, and with a stupendous effort he and Lupin managed to force the curtains closed again.\n\nThe old woman\u2019s screeches died and an echoing silence fell.\n\nPanting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes, Harry\u2019s godfather, Sirius, turned to face him.\n\n\u201cHello, Harry,\u201d he said grimly, \u201cI see you\u2019ve met my mother.\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter5": "THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX\n\n\n\n\nYour \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear old mum, yeah,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the canvas. Let\u2019s get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s a portrait of your mother doing here?\u201d Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them.\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t anyone told you? This was my parents\u2019 house,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cBut I\u2019m the last Black left, so it\u2019s mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for headquarters \u2014 about the only useful thing I\u2019ve been able to do.\u201d\n\nHarry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and bitter Sirius\u2019s voice sounded. He followed his godfather to the bottom of the stairs and through a door leading into the basement kitchen.\n\nIt was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room with rough stone walls. Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of the room, littered with rolls of parchment, goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr. Weasley and his eldest son, Bill, were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table.\n\nMrs. Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired man, who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him and shaking his hand vigorously. \u201cGood to see you!\u201d\n\nOver his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table.\n\n\u201cJourney all right, Harry?\u201d Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once. \u201cMad-Eye didn\u2019t make you come via Greenland, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tried,\u201d said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment. \u201cOh no \u2014 sorry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, dear,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs. Weasley\u2019s charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building.\n\nMrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill\u2019s heavily laden arms.\n\n\u201cThis sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,\u201d she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates.\n\nBill took out his wand, muttered \u201cEvanesco!\u201d and the scrolls vanished.\n\n\u201cSit down, Harry,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cYou\u2019ve met Mundungus, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore and then jerked awake.\n\n\u201cSome\u2019n say m\u2019 name?\u201d Mundungus mumbled sleepily. \u201cI \u2019gree with Sirius . . .\u201d\n\nHe raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny giggled.\n\n\u201cThe meeting\u2019s over, Dung,\u201d said Sirius, as they all sat down around him at the table. \u201cHarry\u2019s arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his matted ginger hair. \u201cBlimey, so \u2019e \u2019as. Yeah . . . you all right, \u2019arry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\nMundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pipe. He stuck it in his mouth, ignited the end of it with his wand, and took a deep pull on it. Great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him in seconds.\n\n\u201cOwe you a \u2019pology,\u201d grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud.\n\n\u201cFor the last time, Mundungus,\u201d called Mrs. Weasley, \u201cwill you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when we\u2019re about to eat!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Mundungus. \u201cRight. Sorry, Molly.\u201d\n\nThe cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered.\n\n\u201cAnd if you want dinner before midnight I\u2019ll need a hand,\u201d Mrs. Weasley said to the room at large. \u201cNo, you can stay where you are, Harry dear, you\u2019ve had a long journey \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can I do, Molly?\u201d said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding forward.\n\nMrs. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 no, it\u2019s all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you\u2019ve done enough today \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, I want to help!\u201d said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair as she hurried toward the dresser from which Ginny was collecting cutlery.\n\nSoon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord, supervised by Mr. Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets, and food from the pantry. Harry was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking mournfully at him.\n\n\u201cSeen old Figgy since?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, I wouldn\u2019t \u2019ave left,\u201d said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, \u201cbut I \u2019ad a business opportunity \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione\u2019s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harry\u2019s legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius\u2019s lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him absentmindedly behind the ears as he turned, still grim-faced, to Harry.\n\n\u201cHad a good summer so far?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s been lousy,\u201d said Harry.\n\nFor the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know what you\u2019re complaining about, myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry incredulously.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019d have welcomed a dementor attack. A deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. You think you\u2019ve had it bad, at least you\u2019ve been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights. . . . I\u2019ve been stuck inside for a month.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come?\u201d asked Harry, frowning.\n\n\u201cBecause the Ministry of Magic\u2019s still after me, and Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big disguise is useless. There\u2019s not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix . . . or so Dumbledore feels.\u201d\n\nThere was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore\u2019s name that told Harry that Sirius was not very happy with the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather.\n\n\u201cAt least you\u2019ve known what\u2019s been going on,\u201d he said bracingly.\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Sirius sarcastically. \u201cListening to Snape\u2019s reports, having to take all his snide hints that he\u2019s out there risking his life while I\u2019m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time . . . asking me how the cleaning\u2019s going \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat cleaning?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cTrying to make this place fit for human habitation,\u201d said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. \u201cNo one\u2019s lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old house-elf, and he\u2019s gone round the twist, hasn\u2019t cleaned anything in ages \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius?\u201d said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to this conversation, but had been minutely examining an empty goblet. \u201cThis solid silver, mate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. \u201cFinest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d come off, though,\u201d muttered Mundungus, polishing it with his cuff.\n\n\u201cFred \u2014 George \u2014 NO, JUST CARRY THEM!\u201d Mrs. Weasley shrieked.\n\nHarry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius\u2019s right hand had been seconds before.\n\n\u201cFOR HEAVEN\u2019S SAKE!\u201d screamed Mrs. Weasley. \u201cTHERE WAS NO NEED \u2014 I\u2019VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS \u2014 JUST BECAUSE YOU\u2019RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were just trying to save a bit of time!\u201d said Fred, hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. \u201cSorry Sirius, mate \u2014 didn\u2019t mean to \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had toppled backward off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet. Crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.\n\n\u201cBoys,\u201d Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, \u201cyour mother\u2019s right, you\u2019re supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you\u2019ve come of age \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!\u201d Mrs. Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again. \u201cBill didn\u2019t feel the need to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn\u2019t Charm everything he met! Percy \u2014\u201d\n\nShe stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s eat,\u201d said Bill quickly.\n\n\u201cIt looks wonderful, Molly,\u201d said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate for her and handing it across the table.\n\nFor a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food. Then Mrs. Weasley turned to Sirius and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to tell you, there\u2019s something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just be a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever you like,\u201d said Sirius indifferently.\n\n\u201cThe curtains in there are full of doxies too,\u201d Mrs. Weasley went on. \u201cI thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his voice, but he was not sure that anyone else did.\n\nOpposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry\u2019s bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape\u2019s, shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and Ginny started requesting their favorite noses.\n\n\u201cDo that one like a pig snout, Tonks . . .\u201d\n\nTonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table.\n\nMr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion about goblins.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not giving anything away yet,\u201d said Bill. \u201cI still can\u2019t work out whether they believe he\u2019s back or not. \u2019Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. Keep out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d never go over to You-Know-Who,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, shaking his head. \u201cThey\u2019ve suffered losses too. Remember that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it depends what they\u2019re offered,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about gold; if they\u2019re offered freedoms we\u2019ve been denying them for centuries they\u2019re going to be tempted. Have you still not had any luck with Ragnok, Bill?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,\u201d said Bill. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know \u2014\u201d\n\nA gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill\u2019s words. Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus were rolling around in their seats.\n\n\u201c. . . and then,\u201d choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, \u201cand then, if you\u2019ll believe it, \u2019e says to me, \u2019e says, \u2018\u2019ere, Dung, where didja get all them toads from? \u2019Cos some son of a Bludger\u2019s gone and nicked all mine!\u2019 And I says, \u2018Nicked all your toads, Will, what next? So you\u2019ll be wanting some more, then?\u2019 And if you\u2019ll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle buys all \u2019is own toads back orf me for twice what \u2019e paid in the first place \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you very much, Mundungus,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped forward onto the table, howling with laughter.\n\n\u201cBeg pardon, Molly,\u201d said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and winking at Harry. \u201cBut, you know, Will nicked \u2019em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I wasn\u2019t really doing nothing wrong \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley coldly.\n\nFred and George buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer; George was hiccuping. For some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather.\n\n\u201cMolly doesn\u2019t approve of Mundungus,\u201d said Sirius in an undertone.\n\n\u201cHow come he\u2019s in the Order?\u201d Harry said very quietly.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s useful,\u201d Sirius muttered. \u201cKnows all the crooks \u2014 well, he would, seeing as he\u2019s one himself. But he\u2019s also very loyal to Dumbledore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung around, he hears things we don\u2019t. But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn\u2019t forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.\u201d\n\nThree helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry\u2019s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something, as the jeans had once been Dudley\u2019s). He lay down his spoon in a lull in the general conversation. Mr. Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase.\n\n\u201cNearly time for bed, I think,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley on a yawn.\n\n\u201cNot just yet, Molly,\u201d said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m surprised at you. I thought the first thing you\u2019d do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort\u2019s name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary.\n\n\u201cI did!\u201d said Harry indignantly. \u201cI asked Ron and Hermione but they said we\u2019re not allowed in the Order, so \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re quite right,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cYou\u2019re too young.\u201d\n\nShe was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched upon its arms, every trace of drowsiness gone.\n\n\u201cSince when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?\u201d asked Sirius. \u201cHarry\u2019s been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He\u2019s got the right to know what\u2019s been happen \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on!\u201d interrupted George loudly.\n\n\u201cHow come Harry gets his questions answered?\u201d said Fred angrily.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven\u2019t told us a single stinking thing!\u201d said George.\n\n\u201c\u2018You\u2019re too young, you\u2019re not in the Order,\u2019\u201d said Fred, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother\u2019s. \u201cHarry\u2019s not even of age!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you haven\u2019t been told what the Order\u2019s doing,\u201d said Sirius calmly. \u201cThat\u2019s your parents\u2019 decision. Harry, on the other hand \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not down to you to decide what\u2019s good for Harry!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley sharply. Her normally kindly face looked dangerous. \u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich bit?\u201d Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though readying himself for a fight.\n\n\u201cThe bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words.\n\nRon, Hermione, Fred, and George\u2019s heads turned from Sirius to Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open. Lupin\u2019s eyes were fixed on Sirius.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cBut as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back\u201d (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), \u201che has more right than most to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cHe\u2019s only fifteen and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and he\u2019s dealt with as much as most in the Order,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cand more than some \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s denying what he\u2019s done!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. \u201cBut he\u2019s still \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a child!\u201d said Sirius impatiently.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not an adult either!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her cheeks. \u201cHe\u2019s not James, Sirius!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,\u201d said Sirius coldly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure you are!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cSometimes, the way you talk about him, it\u2019s as though you think you\u2019ve got your best friend back!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. \u201cYou are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning I\u2019m an irresponsible godfather?\u201d demanded Sirius, his voice rising.\n\n\u201cMeaning you\u2019ve been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please!\u201d said Sirius loudly.\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. \u201cArthur, back me up!\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say, \u201cDumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but there\u2019s a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes!\u201d\n\n\u201cPersonally,\u201d said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, \u201cI think it better that Harry gets the facts \u2014 not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture \u2014 from us, rather than a garbled version from . . . others.\u201d\n\nHis expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs. Weasley\u2019s purge.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, \u201cwell . . . I can see I\u2019m going to be overruled. I\u2019ll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry\u2019s best interests at heart \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not your son,\u201d said Sirius quietly.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as good as,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. \u201cWho else has he got?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got me!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. \u201cThe thing is, it\u2019s been rather difficult for you to look after him while you\u2019ve been locked up in Azkaban, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nSirius started to rise from his chair.\n\n\u201cMolly, you\u2019re not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,\u201d said Lupin sharply. \u201cSirius, sit down.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley\u2019s lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into his chair, his face white.\n\n\u201cI think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,\u201d Lupin continued. \u201cHe\u2019s old enough to decide for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know what\u2019s been going on,\u201d Harry said at once.\n\nHe did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at her mollycoddling. . . . Sirius was right, he was not a child.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking. \u201cGinny \u2014 Ron \u2014 Hermione \u2014 Fred \u2014 George \u2014 I want you out of this kitchen, now.\u201d\n\nThere was instant uproar.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re of age!\u201d Fred and George bellowed together.\n\n\u201cIf Harry\u2019s allowed, why can\u2019t I?\u201d shouted Ron.\n\n\u201cMum, I want to!\u201d wailed Ginny.\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. \u201cI absolutely forbid \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMolly, you can\u2019t stop Fred and George,\u201d said Mr. Weasley wearily. \u201cThey are of age \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still at school \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re legally adults now,\u201d said Mr. Weasley in the same tired voice.\n\nMrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!\u201d said Ron hotly. \u201cWon\u2019t \u2014 won\u2019t you?\u201d he added uncertainly, meeting Harry\u2019s eyes.\n\nFor a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn\u2019t tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course I will,\u201d Harry said. Ron and Hermione beamed.\n\n\u201cFine!\u201d shouted Mrs. Weasley. \u201cFine! Ginny \u2014 BED!\u201d\n\nGinny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall Mrs. Black\u2019s earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only after he had returned, closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke.\n\n\u201cOkay, Harry . . . what do you want to know?\u201d\n\nHarry took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing him for a month.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Voldemort? What\u2019s he doing? I\u2019ve been trying to watch the Muggle news,\u201d he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name, \u201cand there hasn\u2019t been anything that looks like him yet, no funny deaths or anything \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because there haven\u2019t been any suspicious deaths yet,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cnot as far as we know, anyway. . . . And we know quite a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than he thinks we do anyway,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cHow come he\u2019s stopped killing people?\u201d Harry asked. He knew that Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone.\n\n\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t want to draw attention to himself at the moment,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cIt would be dangerous for him. His comeback didn\u2019t come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr rather, you messed it up for him,\u201d said Lupin with a satisfied smile.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Harry asked perplexedly.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to survive!\u201d said Sirius. \u201cNobody apart from his Death Eaters was supposed to know he\u2019d come back. But you survived to bear witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cAnd you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow has that helped?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d said Bill incredulously. \u201cDumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of!\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the Order been doing?\u201d said Harry, looking around at them all.\n\n\u201cWorking as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can\u2019t carry out his plans,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know what his plans are?\u201d Harry asked quickly.\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s got a shrewd idea,\u201d said Lupin, \u201cand Dumbledore\u2019s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what does Dumbledore reckon he\u2019s planning?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cIn the old days he had huge numbers at his command; witches and wizards he\u2019d bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard him planning to recruit the giants; well, they\u2019ll be just one group he\u2019s after. He\u2019s certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to stop him getting more followers?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing our best,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their guard,\u201d said Bill. \u201cIt\u2019s proving tricky, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the Ministry\u2019s attitude,\u201d said Tonks. \u201cYou saw Cornelius Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, Harry. Well, he hasn\u2019t shifted his position at all. He\u2019s absolutely refusing to believe it\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d said Harry desperately. \u201cWhy\u2019s he being so stupid? If Dumbledore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, well, you\u2019ve put your finger on the problem,\u201d said Mr. Weasley with a wry smile. \u201cDumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cFudge is frightened of him, you see,\u201d said Tonks sadly.\n\n\u201cFrightened of Dumbledore?\u201d said Harry incredulously.\n\n\u201cFrightened of what he\u2019s up to,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cYou see, Fudge thinks Dumbledore\u2019s plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister of Magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Dumbledore doesn\u2019t want \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cHe\u2019s never wanted the Minister\u2019s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power instead, but he\u2019s never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even though Dumbledore never applied for the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore\u2019s much cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cBut it seems that he\u2019s become fond of power now, and much more confident. He loves being Minister of Magic, and he\u2019s managed to convince himself that he\u2019s the clever one and Dumbledore\u2019s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can he think that?\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cHow can he think Dumbledore would just make it all up \u2014 that I\u2019d make it all up?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause accepting that Voldemort\u2019s back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn\u2019t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,\u201d said Sirius bitterly. \u201cFudge just can\u2019t bring himself to face it. It\u2019s so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore\u2019s lying to destabilize him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see the problem,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cWhile the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort, it\u2019s hard to convince people he\u2019s back, especially as they really don\u2019t want to believe it in the first place. What\u2019s more, the Ministry\u2019s leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they\u2019re calling Dumbledore\u2019s rumor-mongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely unaware anything\u2019s happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they\u2019re using the Imperius Curse.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re telling people, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Harry, looking around at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. \u201cYou\u2019re letting people know he\u2019s back?\u201d\n\nThey all smiled humorlessly.\n\n\u201cWell, as everyone thinks I\u2019m a mad mass murderer and the Ministry\u2019s put a ten-thousand-Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I?\u201d said Sirius restlessly.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cIt\u2019s an occupational hazard of being a werewolf.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cand it\u2019s very important for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to convince a couple of people, though,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cTonks here, for one \u2014 she\u2019s too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage \u2014 Kingsley Shacklebolt\u2019s been a real asset too. He\u2019s in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he\u2019s been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if none of you\u2019s putting the news out that Voldemort\u2019s back \u2014\u201d Harry began.\n\n\u201cWho said none of us was putting the news out?\u201d said Sirius. \u201cWhy d\u2019you think Dumbledore\u2019s in such trouble?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to discredit him,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see the Daily Prophet last week? They reported that he\u2019d been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he\u2019s getting old and losing his grip, but it\u2019s not true, he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort\u2019s return. They\u2019ve demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot \u2014 that\u2019s the Wizard High Court \u2014 and they\u2019re talking about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Dumbledore says he doesn\u2019t care what they do as long as they don\u2019t take him off the Chocolate Frog cards,\u201d said Bill, grinning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no laughing matter,\u201d said Mr. Weasley shortly. \u201cIf he carries on defying the Ministry like this, he could end up in Azkaban and the last thing we want is Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who knows Dumbledore\u2019s out there and wise to what he\u2019s up to, he\u2019s going to go cautiously for a while. If Dumbledore\u2019s out of the way \u2014 well, You-Know-Who will have a clear field.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if Voldemort\u2019s trying to recruit more Death Eaters, it\u2019s bound to get out that he\u2019s come back, isn\u2019t it?\u201d asked Harry desperately.\n\n\u201cVoldemort doesn\u2019t march up to people\u2019s houses and bang on their front doors, Harry,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cHe tricks, jinxes, and blackmails them. He\u2019s well-practiced at operating in secrecy. In any case, gathering followers is only one thing he\u2019s interested in, he\u2019s got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he\u2019s concentrating on them at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he after apart from followers?\u201d Harry asked swiftly.\n\nHe thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius said, \u201cStuff he can only get by stealth.\u201d\n\nWhen Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, \u201cLike a weapon. Something he didn\u2019t have last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he was powerful before?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what kind of weapon?\u201d said Harry. \u201cSomething worse than the Avada Kedavra \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry had not noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were crossed and she looked furious.\n\n\u201cI want you in bed, now. All of you,\u201d she added, looking around at Fred, George, Ron, and Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t boss us \u2014\u201d Fred began.\n\n\u201cWatch me,\u201d snarled Mrs. Weasley. She was trembling slightly as she looked at Sirius. \u201cYou\u2019ve given Harry plenty of information. Any more and you might just as well induct him into the Order straightaway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll join, I want to join, I want to fight \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIt was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin.\n\n\u201cThe Order is comprised only of overage wizards,\u201d he said. \u201cWizards who have left school,\u201d he added, as Fred and George opened their mouths. \u201cThere are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any of you . . . I think Molly\u2019s right, Sirius. We\u2019ve said enough.\u201d\n\nSirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and Hermione. One by one they stood up and Harry, recognizing defeat, followed suit."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter6": "THE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Weasley followed them upstairs looking grim.\n\n\u201cI want you all to go straight to bed, no talking,\u201d she said as they reached the first landing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a busy day tomorrow. I expect Ginny\u2019s asleep,\u201d she added to Hermione, \u201cso try not to wake her up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsleep, yeah, right,\u201d said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them good night and they were climbing to the next floor. \u201cIf Ginny\u2019s not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs, then I\u2019m a flobberworm . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Ron, Harry,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley on the second landing, pointing them into their bedroom. \u201cOff to bed with you.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Night,\u201d Harry and Ron said to the twins.\n\n\u201cSleep tight,\u201d said Fred, winking.\n\nMrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight. The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry put on his pajamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let them out to hunt every night,\u201d Ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pajamas. \u201cDumbledore doesn\u2019t want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it\u2019ll look suspicious. Oh yeah . . . I forgot . . .\u201d\n\nHe crossed to the door and bolted it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing that for?\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher,\u201d said Ron as he turned off the light. \u201cFirst night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room. Anyway . . .\u201d He got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then turned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window. \u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t need to ask what Ron meant.\n\n\u201cWell, they didn\u2019t tell us much we couldn\u2019t have guessed, did they?\u201d he said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. \u201cI mean, all they\u2019ve really said is that the Order\u2019s trying to stop people joining Vol \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a sharp intake of breath from Ron.\n\n\u201c\u2014 demort ,\u201dsaid Harry firmly. \u201cWhen are you going to start using his name? Sirius and Lupin do.\u201d\n\nRon ignored this last comment. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the Extendable Ears. The only new bit was \u2014\u201d\n\nCrack.\n\n\u201cOUCH!\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down, Ron, or Mum\u2019ll be back up here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou two just Apparated on my knees!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s harder in the dark \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down from Ron\u2019s bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry\u2019s mattress descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet.\n\n\u201cSo, got there yet?\u201d said George eagerly.\n\n\u201cThe weapon Sirius mentioned?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cLet slip, more like,\u201d said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon it is?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cCould be anything,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cBut there can\u2019t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse than death?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s something that can kill loads of people at once,\u201d suggested George.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s some particularly painful way of killing people,\u201d said Ron fearfully.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need anything more efficient than that.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.\n\n\u201cSo who d\u2019you think\u2019s got it now?\u201d asked George.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s our side,\u201d said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.\n\n\u201cIf it is, Dumbledore\u2019s probably keeping it,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d said Ron quickly. \u201cHogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cBet it is!\u201d said George. \u201cThat\u2019s where he hid the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone!\u201d\n\n\u201cA weapon\u2019s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cYeah, size is no guarantee of power,\u201d said George. \u201cLook at Ginny.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cShhh!\u201d said Fred, half-rising from the bed. \u201cListen!\u201d\n\nThey fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs again.\n\n\u201cMum,\u201d said George, and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few seconds later and they heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs. Weasley was plainly listening to see whether they were talking or not.\n\nHedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and George.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t trust us at all, you know,\u201d said Ron regretfully.\n\nHarry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs . . . In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, \u201cBeauties, aren\u2019 they, eh, Harry? We\u2019ll be studyin\u2019 weapons this term . . .\u201d And Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him. . . . He ducked. . . .\n\nThe next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball under his bedclothes, and George\u2019s loud voice was filling the room.\n\n\u201cMum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxies than she thought and she\u2019s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.\u201d\n\nHalf an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long, moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths. Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end.\n\n\u201cCover your faces and take a spray,\u201d Mrs. Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table. \u201cIt\u2019s Doxycide. I\u2019ve never seen an infestation this bad \u2014 what that house-elf\u2019s been doing for the last ten years \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley at these words.\n\n\u201cKreacher\u2019s really old, he probably couldn\u2019t manage \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to, Hermione,\u201d said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. \u201cI\u2019ve just been feeding Buckbeak,\u201d he added, in reply to Harry\u2019s inquiring look. \u201cI keep him upstairs in my mother\u2019s bedroom. Anyway . . . this writing desk . . .\u201d\n\nHe dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time, was shaking slightly.\n\n\u201cWell, Molly, I\u2019m pretty sure this is a boggart,\u201d said Sirius, peering through the keyhole, \u201cbut perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out \u2014 knowing my mother it could be something much worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight you are, Sirius,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\nThey were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before.\n\nA loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand.\n\n\u201cI keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!\u201d said Sirius exasperatedly, hurrying back out of the room. They heard him thundering down the stairs as Mrs. Black\u2019s screeches echoed up through the house once more: \u201cStains of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children of filth . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cClose the door, please, Harry,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley.\n\nHarry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing room door; he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mother\u2019s portrait because she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a deep voice he recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt\u2019s saying, \u201cHestia\u2019s just relieved me, so she\u2019s got Moody\u2019s cloak now, thought I\u2019d leave a report for Dumbledore . . .\u201d\n\nFeeling Mrs. Weasley\u2019s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regretfully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party.\n\nMrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on the sofa.\n\n\u201cRight, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and their teeth are poisonous. I\u2019ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I\u2019d rather nobody needed it.\u201d\n\nShe straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains, and beckoned them all forward.\n\n\u201cWhen I say the word, start spraying immediately,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them. When they\u2019re immobilized, just throw them in this bucket.\u201d\n\nShe stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own spray. \u201cAll right \u2014 squirt!\u201d\n\nHarry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury. Harry caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, onto the worn carpet below. Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket.\n\n\u201cFred, what are you doing?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley sharply. \u201cSpray that at once and throw it away!\u201d\n\nHarry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb.\n\n\u201cRight-o,\u201d Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley\u2019s back was turned he pocketed it with a wink.\n\n\u201cWe want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,\u201d George told Harry under his breath.\n\nDeftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his nose, Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner of his mouth, \u201cWhat are Skiving Snackboxes?\u201d\n\n\u201cRange of sweets to make you ill,\u201d George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs. Weasley\u2019s back. \u201cNot seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing them this summer. They\u2019re double-ended, color-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you\u2019ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018\u2014 which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom.\u2019 That\u2019s what we\u2019re putting in the adverts, anyway,\u201d whispered Fred, who had edged over out of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxies from the floor and adding them to his pocket. \u201cBut they still need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.\u201d\n\n\u201cTesters?\u201d\n\n\u201cUs,\u201d said Fred. \u201cWe take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies \u2014 we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMum thought we\u2019d been dueling,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cJoke shop still on, then?\u201d Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray.\n\n\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t had a chance to get premises yet,\u201d said Fred, dropping his voice even lower as Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack, \u201cso we\u2019re running it as a mail-order service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll thanks to you, mate,\u201d said George. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry . . . Mum hasn\u2019t got a clue. She won\u2019t read the Daily Prophet anymore, \u2019cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nHarry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons.\n\nThe de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was past midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf, sank into a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll tackle those after lunch.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was quite sure was blood.\n\nThe clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cStay here,\u201d she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs. Black\u2019s screeches started up again from down below. \u201cI\u2019ll bring up some sandwiches.\u201d\n\nShe left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once, everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep. They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons.\n\n\u201cMundungus!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWhat\u2019s he brought all those cauldrons for?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably looking for a safe place to keep them,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy cauldrons?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right!\u201d said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view. \u201cBlimey, Mum won\u2019t like that . . .\u201d\n\nHe and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening intently. Mrs. Black\u2019s screaming had stopped again.\n\n\u201cMundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,\u201d Fred muttered, frowning with concentration. \u201cCan\u2019t hear properly . . . d\u2019you reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears?\u201d\n\n\u201cMight be worth it,\u201d said George. \u201cI could sneak upstairs and get a pair \u2014\u201d\n\nBut at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of them could hear exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of her voice.\n\n\u201cWE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!\u201d\n\n\u201cI love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,\u201d said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs. Weasley\u2019s voice to permeate the room better. \u201cIt makes such a nice change.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN\u2019T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idiots are letting her get into her stride,\u201d said George, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours. And she\u2019s been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you, Harry \u2014 and there goes Sirius\u2019s mum again \u2014\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley\u2019s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.\n\nExcept for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and though it was bald like all house-elves, there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its eyes were a bloodshot and watery gray, and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike.\n\nThe elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and doggedly, toward the far end of the room, muttering under its breath all the while in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog\u2019s, \u201c. . . Smells like a drain and a criminal to boot, but she\u2019s no better, nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my Mistress\u2019s house, oh my poor Mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they\u2019ve let in her house, what would she say to old Kreacher, oh the shame of it, Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can he do . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, Kreacher,\u201d said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a snap.\n\nThe house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and then gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.\n\n\u201cKreacher did not see Young Master,\u201d he said, turning around and bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly, \u201cNasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d said George. \u201cDidn\u2019t catch that last bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher said nothing,\u201d said the elf, with a second bow to George, adding in a clear undertone, \u201cand there\u2019s its twin, unnatural little beasts they are.\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened up, eyeing them all very malevolently, and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.\n\n\u201c. . . and there\u2019s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if my Mistress knew, oh how she\u2019d cry, and there\u2019s a new boy, Kreacher doesn\u2019t know his name, what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn\u2019t know . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Harry, Kreacher,\u201d said Hermione tentatively. \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d\n\nKreacher\u2019s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever.\n\n\u201cThe Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend, if Kreacher\u2019s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she say \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call her a Mudblood!\u201d said Ron and Ginny together, very angrily.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Hermione whispered, \u201che\u2019s not in his right mind, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he\u2019s saying,\u201d said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.\n\nKreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.\n\n\u201cIs it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be true, that\u2019s that boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders how he did it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t we all, Kreacher?\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want anyway?\u201d George asked.\n\nKreacher\u2019s huge eyes darted onto George.\n\n\u201cKreacher is cleaning,\u201d he said evasively.\n\n\u201cA likely story,\u201d said a voice behind Harry.\n\nSirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen. At the sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor.\n\n\u201cStand up straight,\u201d said Sirius impatiently. \u201cNow, what are you up to?\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher is cleaning,\u201d the elf repeated. \u201cKreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and it\u2019s getting blacker every day, it\u2019s filthy,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cMaster always liked his little joke,\u201d said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, \u201cMaster was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother\u2019s heart \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t have a heart, Kreacher,\u201d Sirius snapped. \u201cShe kept herself alive out of pure spite.\u201d\n\nKreacher bowed again and said, \u201cWhatever Master says,\u201d then muttered furiously, \u201cMaster is not fit to wipe slime from his mother\u2019s boots, oh my poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked you what you were up to,\u201d said Sirius coldly. \u201cEvery time you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to your room so we can\u2019t throw it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master\u2019s house,\u201d said the elf, then muttered very fast, \u201cMistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it\u2019s been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it might be that,\u201d said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall. \u201cShe\u2019ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it, I don\u2019t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will. Now go away, Kreacher.\u201d\n\nIt seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was redolent of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room.\n\n\u201c\u2014 comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh my poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers and he\u2019s back, they say he\u2019s a murderer too \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep muttering and I will be a murderer!\u201d said Sirius irritably, and he slammed the door shut on the elf.\n\n\u201cSirius, he\u2019s not right in the head,\u201d said Hermione pleadingly, \u201cI don\u2019t think he realizes we can hear him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been alone too long,\u201d said Sirius, \u201ctaking mad orders from my mother\u2019s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul little \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you just set him free,\u201d said Hermione hopefully, \u201cmaybe \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t set him free, he knows too much about the Order,\u201d said Sirius curtly. \u201cAnd anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.\u201d\n\nSirius walked across the room, where the tapestry Kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.\n\nThe tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as though doxies had gnawed it in places; nevertheless, the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:\n\nTHE NOBLE AND MOST ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK\n\n\u201cTOUJOURS PUR\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not on here!\u201d said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the tree.\n\n\u201cI used to be there,\u201d said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. \u201cMy sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home \u2014 Kreacher\u2019s quite fond of muttering the story under his breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ran away from home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was about sixteen,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cI\u2019d had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d asked Harry, staring at him.\n\n\u201cYour dad\u2019s place,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cYour grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad\u2019s during the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold \u2014 he\u2019s been wiped off here too, that\u2019s probably why \u2014 anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potter\u2019s for Sunday lunch, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut . . . why did you . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave?\u201d Sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand through his long, unkempt hair. \u201cBecause I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . . that\u2019s him.\u201d\n\nSirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name REGULUS BLACK. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth.\n\n\u201cHe was younger than me,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cand a much better son, as I was constantly reminded.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he died,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cStupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, Harry, haven\u2019t you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were?\u201d said Sirius testily.\n\n\u201cWere \u2014 were your parents Death Eaters as well?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and having purebloods in charge. They weren\u2019t alone either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colors, who thought he had the right idea about things. . . . They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas he killed by an Auror?\u201d Harry asked tentatively.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cNo, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort\u2019s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don\u2019t just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It\u2019s a lifetime of service or death.\u201d\n\n\u201cLunch,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley\u2019s voice.\n\nShe was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to the tapestry.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t looked at this for years. There\u2019s Phineas Nigellus . . . my great-great-grandfather, see? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had . . . and Araminta Meliflua . . . cousin of my mother\u2019s . . . tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal . . . and dear Aunt Elladora . . . she started the family tradition of beheading house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays . . . of course, anytime the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isn\u2019t on here. Maybe that\u2019s why Kreacher won\u2019t take orders from her \u2014 he\u2019s supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and Tonks are related?\u201d Harry asked, surprised.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,\u201d said Sirius, examining the tapestry carefully. \u201cNo, Andromeda\u2019s not on here either, look \u2014\u201d\n\nHe pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa.\n\n\u201cAndromeda\u2019s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks, so \u2014\u201d\n\nSirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly. Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names to the right of Andromeda\u2019s burn mark. A double line of gold embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re related to the Malfoys!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pure-blood families are all interrelated,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cIf you\u2019re only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur\u2019s something like my second cousin once removed. But there\u2019s no point looking for them on here \u2014 if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it\u2019s the Weasleys.\u201d\n\nBut Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda\u2019s burn: Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange.\n\n\u201cLestrange . . .\u201d Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something in his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he couldn\u2019t think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in Azkaban,\u201d said Sirius shortly.\n\nHarry looked at him curiously.\n\n\u201cBellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch, Junior,\u201d said Sirius in the same brusque voice. \u201cRodolphus\u2019s brother, Rabastan, was with them too.\u201d\n\nAnd Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes, who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty.\n\n\u201cYou never said she was your \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it matter if she\u2019s my cousin?\u201d snapped Sirius. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re not my family. She\u2019s certainly not my family. I haven\u2019t seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her coming in to Azkaban. D\u2019you think I\u2019m proud of having relatives like her?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry quickly, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2014 I was just surprised, that\u2019s all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, don\u2019t apologize,\u201d Sirius mumbled at once. He turned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. \u201cI don\u2019t like being back here,\u201d he said, staring across the drawing room. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be stuck in this house again.\u201d\n\nHarry understood completely. He knew how he would feel if forced, when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place forever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ideal for headquarters, of course,\u201d Sirius said. \u201cMy father put every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived here. It\u2019s Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call \u2014 as if they\u2019d have wanted to \u2014 and now Dumbledore\u2019s added his protection, you\u2019d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore\u2019s Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know \u2014 nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is \u2014 that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore . . .\u201d Sirius gave a short, barklike laugh. \u201cIf my parents could see the use it was being put to now . . . well, my mother\u2019s portrait should give you some idea . . .\u201d\n\nHe scowled for a moment, then sighed.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful. I\u2019ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing \u2014 as Snuffles, obviously \u2014 so I can give you a bit of moral support, what d\u2019you think?\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best, of hearing everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Sirius\u2019s words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius had been watching him. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to clear you, there\u2019s definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if they do expel me,\u201d said Harry, quietly, \u201ccan I come back here and live with you?\u201d\n\nSirius smiled sadly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn\u2019t have to go back to the Dursleys,\u201d Harry pressed him.\n\n\u201cThey must be bad if you prefer this place,\u201d said Sirius gloomily.\n\n\u201cHurry up, you two, or there won\u2019t be any food left,\u201d Mrs. Weasley called.\n\nSirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry, and he and Harry went to join the others.\n\nHarry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds, his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, \u201cmust be Wartcap powder in there.\u201d\n\nHe threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already doxy-filled pocket.\n\nThey found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry\u2019s arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin; Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature\u2019s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket that none of them could open, a number of ancient seals and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius\u2019s grandfather for \u201cServices to the Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means he gave them a load of gold,\u201d said Sirius contemptuously, throwing the medal into the rubbish sack.\n\nSeveral times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the Black crest from his grip Kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling Sirius names Harry had never heard before.\n\n\u201cIt was my father\u2019s,\u201d said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack. \u201cKreacher wasn\u2019t quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging a pair of my father\u2019s old trousers last week.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. The drawing room took three days to decontaminate; finally the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing desk; Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be sure what was inside it.\n\nThey moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders large as saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half). The china, which bore the Black crest and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashed.\n\nSnape might refer to their work as \u201ccleaning,\u201d but in Harry\u2019s opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, \u201cMaster must do as Master wishes,\u201d before turning away and muttering very loudly, \u201cbut Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum . . .\u201d\n\nAt which Sirius, ignoring Hermione\u2019s protests, seized Kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.\n\nThe doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius\u2019s mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to Harry\u2019s relief they never came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though she also seemed too busy to linger.\n\nSometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passersby. Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. Weasley\u2019s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.\n\nDespite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he was busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled. The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys\u2019 . . . but he would not go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius.\n\nHe felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs. Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry, and I want you to wash your hair tonight too. A good first impression can work wonders.\u201d\n\nRon, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops, but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew.\n\n\u201cHow am I getting there?\u201d he asked Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound unconcerned.\n\n\u201cArthur\u2019s taking you to work with him,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley gently.\n\nMr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.\n\n\u201cYou can wait in my office until it\u2019s time for the hearing,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question, Mrs. Weasley had answered it.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for Sirius to go with you, and I must say I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 think he\u2019s quite right,\u201d said Sirius through clenched teeth.\n\nMrs. Weasley pursed her lips.\n\n\u201cWhen did Dumbledore tell you that?\u201d Harry said, staring at Sirius.\n\n\u201cHe came last night, when you were in bed,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\nSirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry dropped his own eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if that were possible, even worse."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter7": "THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\n\n\n\n\nHarry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered again.\n\nRon was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto the landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher\u2019s ancestors, and into the kitchen.\n\nHe had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when he pushed it open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered.\n\n\u201cBreakfast,\u201d she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire.\n\n\u201cM-m-morning, Harry,\u201d yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. \u201cSleep all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve b-b-been up all night,\u201d she said, with another shuddering yawn. \u201cCome and sit down . . .\u201d\n\nShe drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want, Harry?\u201d Mrs. Weasley called. \u201cPorridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust \u2014 just toast, thanks,\u201d said Harry.\n\nLupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, \u201cWhat were you saying about Scrimgeour?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he\u2019s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201c. . . and I\u2019ll have to tell Dumbledore I can\u2019t do night duty tomorrow, I\u2019m just t-t-too tired,\u201d Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll cover for you,\u201d said Mr. Weasley. \u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019ve got a report to finish anyway . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley was not wearing wizard\u2019s robes but a pair of pin-striped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry.\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\nHarry shrugged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all be over soon,\u201d Mr. Weasley said bracingly. \u201cIn a few hours\u2019 time you\u2019ll be cleared.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing.\n\n\u201cThe hearing\u2019s on my floor, in Amelia Bones\u2019s office. She\u2019s Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she\u2019s the one who\u2019ll be questioning you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmelia Bones is okay, Harry,\u201d said Tonks earnestly. \u201cShe\u2019s fair, she\u2019ll hear you out.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lose your temper,\u201d said Sirius abruptly. \u201cBe polite and stick to the facts.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded again.\n\n\u201cThe law\u2019s on your side,\u201d said Lupin quietly. \u201cEven underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.\u201d\n\nSomething very cold trickled down the back of Harry\u2019s neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it ever lie flat?\u201d she said desperately.\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\nMr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll go now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit early, but I think you\u2019ll be better off there than hanging around here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right, Harry,\u201d said Tonks, patting him on the arm.\n\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if it\u2019s not,\u201d said Sirius grimly, \u201cI\u2019ll see to Amelia Bones for you . . .\u201d\n\nHarry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all got our fingers crossed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell . . . see you later then.\u201d\n\nHe followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius\u2019s mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t normally walk to work, do you?\u201d Harry asked him, as they set off briskly around the square.\n\n\u201cNo, I usually Apparate,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, \u201cbut obviously you can\u2019t, and I think it\u2019s best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better impression, given what you\u2019re being disciplined for . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Underground station they found it already full of early morning commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cSimply fabulous,\u201d he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. \u201cWonderfully ingenious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re out of order,\u201d said Harry, pointing at the sign.\n\n\u201cYes, but even so . . .\u201d said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them.\n\nThey bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London. Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground map above the windows.\n\n\u201cFour stops, Harry . . . three stops left now . . . two stops to go, Harry . . .\u201d\n\nThey got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged onto a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings, already full of traffic.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley\u2019s continual references to the map; but a second later he said, \u201cAh yes . . . this way, Harry,\u201d and led him down a side road.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I\u2019ve never even used the visitor\u2019s entrance before.\u201d\n\nThe farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic.\n\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffittied wall. \u201cAfter you, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe opened the telephone box door.\n\nHarry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr. Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.\n\n\u201cMr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. \u201cLet\u2019s see . . . six . . .\u201d he dialed the number, \u201ctwo . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another two . . .\u201d\n\nAs the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasley\u2019s hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . .\u201d said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk into the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, \u201cArthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said the cool female voice. \u201cVisitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.\u201d\n\nThere was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: It was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.\n\n\u201cVisitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.\u201d\n\nThe floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from watering.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,\u201d said the woman\u2019s voice.\n\nThe door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.\n\nThey were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart.\n\nHalfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur\u2019s arrow, the tip of the goblin\u2019s hat, and each of the house-elf\u2019s ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall.\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\nThey joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A small, smudged sign beside it read:\n\nAll proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries\n\n\n\nIf I\u2019m not expelled from Hogwarts, I\u2019ll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately.\n\n\u201cOver here, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying SECURITY. A badly shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m escorting a visitor,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry.\n\n\u201cStep over here,\u201d said the wizard in a bored voice.\n\nHarry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry\u2019s front and back.\n\n\u201cWand,\u201d grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand.\n\nHarry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it.\n\n\u201cEleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry nervously.\n\n\u201cI keep this,\u201d said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike. \u201cYou get this back,\u201d he added, thrusting the wand at Harry.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on . . .\u201d said the wizard slowly.\n\nHis eyes had darted from the silver visitor\u2019s badge on Harry\u2019s chest to his forehead.\n\n\u201cThank you, Eric,\u201d said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates.\n\nJostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises.\n\n\u201cAll right, Arthur?\u201d said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ve you got there, Bob?\u201d asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure,\u201d said the wizard seriously. \u201cWe thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.\u201d\n\nWith a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against the back wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone\u2019s eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again.\n\n\u201cLevel seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.\u201d\n\nThe lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the woman\u2019s voice said, \u201cLevel six, Department of Magical Transport, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Center.\u201d\n\nOnce again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet color and he could see MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edges of their wings.\n\n\u201cJust Interdepartmental memos,\u201d Mr. Weasley muttered to him. \u201cWe used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings all over the desks . . .\u201d\n\nAs they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the swaying lamp in the lift\u2019s ceiling.\n\n\u201cLevel five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.\u201d\n\nWhen the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they darted around it.\n\n\u201cLevel four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019S\u2019cuse,\u201d said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again.\n\n\u201cLevel three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.\u201d\n\nEverybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors opened and the voice said, \u201cLevel two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is us, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. \u201cMy office is on the other side of the floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Weasley,\u201d said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, \u201caren\u2019t we underground?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we are,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, \u201cthose are enchanted windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather we\u2019re getting every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay raise. . . . Just round here, Harry.\u201d\n\nThey turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors, and emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which were buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read AUROR HEADQUARTERS.\n\nHarry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill\u2019s was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt.\n\n\u201cMorning, Weasley,\u201d said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, if it really is a second,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, \u201cI\u2019m in rather a hurry.\u201d\n\nThey were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle.\n\nHarry received a slight shock; Sirius\u2019s face was blinking down at him from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs \u2014 even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters\u2019 wedding \u2014 papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand, \u201cI need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We\u2019ve received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.\u201d\n\nKingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, \u201cGive him the magazine, he might find it interesting.\u201d Then he said in normal tones, \u201cAnd don\u2019t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you had read my report you would know that the term is \u2018firearms,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Weasley coolly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we\u2019re extremely busy at the moment.\u201d He dropped his voice and said, \u201cIf you can get away before seven, Molly\u2019s making meatballs.\u201d\n\nHe beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley\u2019s cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading MISUSE OF MUGGLE ARTIFACTS.\n\nMr. Weasley\u2019s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley\u2019s obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children\u2019s books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.\n\nSitting on top of Mr. Weasley\u2019s overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got a window,\u201d said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked, but they don\u2019t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn\u2019t look as if Perkins is in yet.\u201d\n\nHarry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins\u2019s desk while Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given him.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, \u201cyes . . .\u201d He flicked through it. \u201cYes, he\u2019s right, I\u2019m sure Sirius will find that very amusing \u2014 oh dear, what\u2019s this now?\u201d\n\nA memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read aloud, \u201c\u2018Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.\u2019 This is getting ridiculous . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cA regurgitating toilet?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnti-Muggle pranksters,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \u201cWe had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing \u2014 well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those \u2014 those pumbles, I think they\u2019re called \u2014 you know, the ones who mend pipes and things \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPlumbers?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 exactly, yes, but of course they\u2019re flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill it be Aurors who catch them?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it\u2019ll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol \u2014 ah, Harry, this is Perkins.\u201d\n\nA stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting.\n\n\u201cOh Arthur!\u201d he said desperately, without looking at Harry. \u201cThank goodness, I didn\u2019t know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not, I\u2019ve just sent an owl to your home but you\u2019ve obviously missed it \u2014 an urgent message came ten minutes ago \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know about the regurgitating toilet,\u201d said Mr. Weasley.\n\n\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not the toilet, it\u2019s the Potter boy\u2019s hearing \u2014 they\u2019ve changed the time and venue \u2014 it starts at eight o\u2019clock now and it\u2019s down in old Courtroom Ten \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDown in old \u2014 but they told me \u2014 Merlin\u2019s beard \u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his chair.\n\n\u201cQuick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!\u201d\n\nPerkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, Harry on his heels.\n\n\u201cWhy have they changed the time?\u201d Harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at Perkins\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you\u2019d missed it it would have been catastrophic!\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button.\n\n\u201cCome ON!\u201d\n\nThe lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button.\n\n\u201cThose courtrooms haven\u2019t been used in years,\u201d said Mr. Weasley angrily. \u201cI can\u2019t think why they\u2019re doing it down there \u2014 unless \u2014 but no . . .\u201d\n\nA plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate.\n\n\u201cThe Atrium,\u201d said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in.\n\n\u201cMorning, Arthur,\u201d he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend. \u201cDon\u2019t often see you down here . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cUrgent business, Bode,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry.\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nHarry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable.\n\n\u201cDepartment of Mysteries,\u201d said the cool female voice, and left it at that.\n\n\u201cQuick, Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps.\n\n\u201cDown here, down here,\u201d panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at a time. \u201cThe lift doesn\u2019t even come down this far . . . why they\u2019re doing it there . . .\u201d\n\nThey reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor, which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape\u2019s dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes.\n\n\u201cCourtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we\u2019re nearly . . . yes.\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest.\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. \u201cGet in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t \u2014 aren\u2019t you coming with \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not allowed. Good luck!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam\u2019s apple. He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped inside the courtroom."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter8": "THE HEARING\n\n\n\n\nHarry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it before, he had been here before: This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve, the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.\n\nThe walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell.\n\nA cold male voice rang across the courtroom.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry nervously. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t know the time had changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not the Wizengamot\u2019s fault,\u201d said the voice. \u201cAn owl was sent to you this morning. Take your seat.\u201d\n\nHarry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked rather threateningly but did not bind him. Feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the bench above.\n\nThere were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plum-colored robes with an elaborately worked silver W on the left-hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.\n\nIn the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on Fudge\u2019s left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge\u2019s right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cThe accused being present \u2014 finally \u2014 let us begin. Are you ready?\u201d he called down the row.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron\u2019s brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy\u2019s eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand.\n\n\u201cDisciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,\u201d said Fudge in a ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, \u201cinto offenses committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.\n\n\u201cInterrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement; Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,\u201d said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck.\n\nDumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose.\n\nThe members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands and waved in welcome.\n\nA powerful emotion had risen in Harry\u2019s chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore\u2019s eye, but Dumbledore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. \u201cDumbledore. Yes. You \u2014 er \u2014 got our \u2014 er \u2014 message that the time and \u2014 er \u2014 place of the hearing had been changed, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI must have missed it,\u201d said Dumbledore cheerfully. \u201cHowever, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes \u2014 well \u2014 I suppose we\u2019ll need another chair \u2014 I \u2014 Weasley, could you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot to worry, not to worry,\u201d said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. \u201cWell, then. So. The charges. Yes.\u201d\n\nHe extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took a deep breath, and read, \u201cThe charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International Confederation of Wizards\u2019 Statute of Secrecy.\n\n\u201cYou are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?\u201d Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his parchment.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cYou received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August?\u201d said Fudge.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKnowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKnowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cbut I only used it because we were \u2014\u201d\n\nThe witch with the monocle on Fudge\u2019s left cut across him in a booming voice.\n\n\u201cYou produced a fully fledged Patronus?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbecause \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA corporeal Patronus?\u201d\n\n\u201cA \u2014 what?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYour Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was more than vapor or smoke?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate, \u201cit\u2019s a stag, it\u2019s always a stag.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways?\u201d boomed Madam Bones. \u201cYou have produced a Patronus before now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it for over a year \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are fifteen years old?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou learned this at school?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cImpressive,\u201d said Madam Bones, staring down at him, \u201ca true Patronus at that age . . . very impressive indeed.\u201d\n\nSome of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again; a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of how impressive the magic was,\u201d said Fudge in a testy voice. \u201cIn fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!\u201d\n\nThose who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but it was the sight of Percy\u2019s sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry into speech.\n\n\u201cI did it because of the dementors!\u201d he said loudly, before anyone could interrupt him again.\n\nHe had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before.\n\n\u201cDementors?\u201d said Madam Bones after a moment, raising her thick eyebrows so that her monocle looked in danger of falling out. \u201cWhat do you mean, boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. \u201cYes. Yes, I thought we\u2019d be hearing something like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDementors in Little Whinging?\u201d Madam Bones said in tones of great surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t understand \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you, Amelia?\u201d said Fudge, still smirking. \u201cLet me explain. He\u2019s been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can\u2019t see dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it\u2019s just your word and no witnesses . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201d said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering from the court. \u201cThere were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough, enough!\u201d said Fudge with a very supercilious look on his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt what I\u2019m sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story \u2014\u201d\n\nDumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again.\n\n\u201cWe do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway,\u201d he said, \u201cother than Dudley Dursley, I mean.\u201d\n\nFudge\u2019s plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two, then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together, said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t got time to listen to more taradiddles, I\u2019m afraid, Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI may be wrong,\u201d said Dumbledore pleasantly, \u201cbut I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case? Isn\u2019t that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?\u201d he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle.\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Madam Bones. \u201cPerfectly true.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very well, very well,\u201d snapped Fudge. \u201cWhere is this person?\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought her with me,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cShe\u2019s just outside the door. Should I \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 Weasley, you go,\u201d Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at once, hurried down the stone steps from the judge\u2019s balcony, and hastened past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.\n\nA moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She looked scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers.\n\nDumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a second one for himself.\n\n\u201cFull name?\u201d said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat.\n\n\u201cArabella Doreen Figg,\u201d said Mrs. Figg in her quavery voice.\n\n\u201cAnd who exactly are you?\u201d said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter lives,\u201d said Mrs. Figg.\n\n\u201cWe have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging other than Harry Potter,\u201d said Madam Bones at once. \u201cThat situation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Squib,\u201d said Mrs. Figg. \u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t have me registered, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Squib, eh?\u201d said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. \u201cWe\u2019ll be checking that. You\u2019ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant, Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?\u201d he added, looking left and right along the bench where he sat.\n\n\u201cYes, we can!\u201d said Mrs. Figg indignantly.\n\nFudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cWhat is your story?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of August,\u201d gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, \u201cwhen I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRunning?\u201d said Madam Bones sharply. \u201cDementors don\u2019t run, they glide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I meant to say,\u201d said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. \u201cGliding along the alley toward what looked like two boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did they look like?\u201d said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the monocle\u2019s edges disappeared into her flesh.\n\n\u201cWell, one was very large and the other one rather skinny \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said Madam Bones impatiently, \u201cthe dementors . . . describe them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now. \u201cThey were big. Big and wearing cloaks.\u201d\n\nHarry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible, rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard with a large black mustache in the second row leaned close to his neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch, and whispered something in her ear. She smirked and nodded.\n\n\u201cBig and wearing cloaks,\u201d repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. \u201cI see. Anything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Figg. \u201cI felt them. Everything went cold, and this was a very warm summer\u2019s night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . . dreadful things . . .\u201d\n\nHer voice shook and died.\n\nMadam Bones\u2019 eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.\n\n\u201cWhat did the dementors do?\u201d she asked, and Harry felt a rush of hope.\n\n\u201cThey went for the boys,\u201d said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. \u201cOne of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced silver vapor. On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased away the second from his cousin. And that . . . that was what happened,\u201d Mrs. Figg finished, somewhat lamely.\n\nMadam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence; Fudge was not looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his eyes and said, rather aggressively, \u201cThat\u2019s what you saw, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was what happened,\u201d Mrs. Figg repeated.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Fudge. \u201cYou may go.\u201d\n\nMrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then got up and shuffled off toward the door again. Harry heard it thud shut behind her.\n\n\u201cNot a very convincing witness,\u201d said Fudge loftily.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Madam Bones in her booming voice. \u201cShe certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately. And I can\u2019t imagine why she would say they were there if they weren\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard?\u201d snorted Fudge. \u201cThe odds on that must be very, very long, even Bagman wouldn\u2019t have bet \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence,\u201d said Dumbledore lightly.\n\nThe witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent.\n\n\u201cAnd what is that supposed to mean?\u201d asked Fudge icily.\n\n\u201cIt means that I think they were ordered there,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!\u201d barked Fudge.\n\n\u201cNot if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cI have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you have,\u201d said Fudge forcefully, \u201cand I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, \u201cwe must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of August.\u201d\n\nIn the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the right of Fudge leaned forward so that Harry saw her for the first time.\n\nHe thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round, and slightly bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue.\n\n\u201cThe Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,\u201d said Fudge.\n\nThe witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,\u201d she said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. \u201cSo silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!\u201d\n\nShe gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused.\n\n\u201cIf it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,\u201d said Dumbledore politely. \u201cOf course, these particular dementors may have been outside Ministry control \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no dementors outside Ministry control!\u201d snapped Fudge, who had turned brick red.\n\nDumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.\n\n\u201cThen undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorization.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do, Dumbledore!\u201d snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of which Uncle Vernon would have been proud.\n\n\u201cOf course it isn\u2019t,\u201d said Dumbledore mildly. \u201cI was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.\u201d\n\nHe glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him, frowning slightly.\n\n\u201cI would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors, if indeed they are not figments of this boy\u2019s imagination, is not the subject of this hearing!\u201d said Fudge. \u201cWe are here to examine Harry Potter\u2019s offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we are,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cbut the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or Muggles present at the time of the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!\u201d snarled Fudge.\n\n\u201cOf course you are,\u201d said Dumbledore courteously. \u201cThen we are in agreement that Harry\u2019s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there were dementors, which I doubt \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have heard from an eyewitness,\u201d Dumbledore interrupted. \u201cIf you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am sure she would not object.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 that \u2014 not \u2014\u201d blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 I want this over with today, Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut naturally, you would not care how many times you heard from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cSerious miscarriage, my hat!\u201d said Fudge at the top of his voice. \u201cHave you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you\u2019ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t me, it was a house-elf!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYOU SEE?\u201d roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry\u2019s direction. \u201cA house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 not \u2014 I haven\u2019t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway, that\u2019s not the only \u2014 he blew up his aunt, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Fudge shouted, banging his fist on the judge\u2019s bench and upsetting a bottle of ink.\n\n\u201cAnd you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes.\n\n\u201cAnd I haven\u2019t even started on what he gets up to at school \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school, Harry\u2019s behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry,\u201d said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words.\n\n\u201cOho!\u201d said Fudge. \u201cNot our business what he does at school, eh? You think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaws can be changed,\u201d said Fudge savagely.\n\n\u201cOf course they can,\u201d said Dumbledore, inclining his head. \u201cAnd you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!\u201d\n\nA few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am aware, however,\u201d Dumbledore continued, \u201cthere is no law yet in place that says this court\u2019s job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offense and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do now is to await your verdict.\u201d\n\nDumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more. Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry\u2019s attempt to catch his eye. He continued to look up at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, whispered conversations.\n\nHarry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had expected the hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression. He had not really said very much. He ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed. . . .\n\nTwice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes.\n\nThen the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining his laces.\n\n\u201cThose in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?\u201d said Madam Bones\u2019s booming voice.\n\nHarry\u2019s head jerked upward. There were hands in the air, many of them . . . more than half! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but before he could finish Madam Bones had said, \u201cAnd those in favor of conviction?\u201d\n\nFudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on his right and the heavily mustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in the second row.\n\nFudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, \u201cVery well, very well . . . cleared of all charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling out his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. \u201cWell, I must be getting along. Good day to you all.\u201d\n\nAnd without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter9": "THE WOES OF MRS. WEASLEY\n\n\n\n\nDumbledore\u2019s abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise. He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair, struggling with his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were all getting to their feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and packing them away. Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge\u2019s right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge\u2019s eye, or Madam Bones\u2019s, wanting to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase, so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody called him back, broke into a very fast walk.\n\nHe took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door, and almost collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside, looking pale and apprehensive.\n\n\u201cDumbledore didn\u2019t say \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCleared,\u201d Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, \u201cof all charges!\u201d\n\nBeaming, Mr. Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders.\n\n\u201cHarry, that\u2019s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn\u2019t have found you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can\u2019t pretend I wasn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just opened again. The Wizengamot were filing out.\n\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s beard,\u201d said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to let them all pass, \u201cyou were tried by the full court?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\nOne or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed and a few, including Madam Bones, said, \u201cMorning, Arthur,\u201d to Mr. Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as though Mr. Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and Harry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines around Mr. Weasley\u2019s mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he gave no sign that he had noticed his third son.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news,\u201d he said, beckoning Harry forward as Percy\u2019s heels disappeared up the stairs to the ninth level. \u201cI\u2019ll drop you off on the way to that toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what will you have to do about the toilet?\u201d Harry asked, grinning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It was starting to sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a simple enough anti-jinx,\u201d said Mr. Weasley as they mounted the stairs, \u201cbut it\u2019s not so much having to repair the damage, it\u2019s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting might strike some wizards as funny, but it\u2019s an expression of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one \u2014\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the ninth-level corridor, and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet away from them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed, pale face.\n\nThe second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He too broke off in mid-conversation, his cold gray eyes narrowed and fixed upon Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well . . . Patronus Potter,\u201d said Lucius Malfoy coolly.\n\nHarry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something heavy. He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death Eater\u2019s hood, and last heard that man\u2019s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord Voldemort tortured him. He could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater.\n\n\u201cThe Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,\u201d drawled Mr. Malfoy. \u201cQuite astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Weasley gripped Harry\u2019s shoulder in warning.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cyeah, I\u2019m good at escaping . . .\u201d\n\nLucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAnd Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?\u201d\n\n\u201cI work here,\u201d said Mr. Weasley shortly.\n\n\u201cNot here, surely?\u201d said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glancing toward the door over Mr. Weasley\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI thought you were up on the second floor. . . . Don\u2019t you do something that involves sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting into Harry\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here anyway?\u201d Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours, Potter,\u201d said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his robes; Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold. \u201cReally, just because you are Dumbledore\u2019s favorite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us. . . . Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr. Weasley. \u201cThis way, Lucius.\u201d\n\nThey strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not let go of Harry\u2019s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.\n\n\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t he waiting outside Fudge\u2019s office if they\u2019ve got business to do together?\u201d Harry burst out furiously. \u201cWhat was he doing down here?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely agitated as he glanced over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard. \u201cTrying to find out whether you\u2019d been expelled or not. I\u2019ll leave a note for Dumbledore when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy\u2019s been talking to Fudge again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat private business have they got together anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cGold, I expect,\u201d said Mr. Weasley angrily. \u201cMalfoy\u2019s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years. . . . Gets him in with the right people . . . then he can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn\u2019t want passed . . . Oh, he\u2019s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy . . .\u201d\n\nThe lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around Mr. Weasley\u2019s head as he pressed the button for the Atrium and the doors clanged shut; he waved them away irritably.\n\n\u201cMr. Weasley,\u201d said Harry slowly, \u201cif Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he\u2019s seeing them alone, how do we know they haven\u2019t put the Imperius Curse on him?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think it hadn\u2019t occurred to us, Harry,\u201d muttered Mr. Weasley. \u201cBut Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment \u2014 which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort. . . . Best not talk about it anymore just now, Harry . . .\u201d\n\nThe doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almost-deserted Atrium. Eric the security man was hidden behind his Daily Prophet again. They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry remembered.\n\n\u201cWait . . .\u201d he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from his pocket, he turned back to the fountain.\n\nHe looked up into the handsome wizard\u2019s face, but up close, Harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf\u2019s attitude of creeping servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry turned his money bag upside down and emptied not just ten Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues\u2019 feet.\n\n\u201cI knew it!\u201d yelled Ron, punching the air. \u201cYou always get away with stuff!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were bound to clear you,\u201d said Hermione, who had looked positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes. \u201cThere was no case against you, none at all . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew I\u2019d get off,\u201d said Harry, smiling.\n\nMrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George, and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went \u201cHe got off, he got off, he got off \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, settle down!\u201d shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too was smiling. \u201cListen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Sirius sharply.\n\n\u201cHe got off, he got off, he got off \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level nine, then they went up to Fudge\u2019s office together. Dumbledore ought to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell him, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d better get going, there\u2019s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal Green waiting for me. Molly, I\u2019ll be late, I\u2019m covering for Tonks, but Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe got off, he got off, he got off \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough \u2014 Fred \u2014 George \u2014 Ginny!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, as Mr. Weasley left the kitchen. \u201cHarry dear, come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast . . .\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, and Harry\u2019s feeling of giddy relief, which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy, swelled again. The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you,\u201d said Ron happily, now dishing great mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone\u2019s plates.\n\n\u201cYeah, he swung it for me,\u201d said Harry. He felt that it would sound highly ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, \u201cI wish he\u2019d talked to me, though. Or even looked at me.\u201d\n\nAnd as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Hermione, looking alarmed.\n\n\u201cScar,\u201d Harry mumbled. \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing. . . . It happens all the time now . . .\u201d\n\nNone of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over Harry\u2019s narrow escape; Fred, George, and Ginny were still singing. Hermione looked rather anxious, but before she could say anything, Ron said happily, \u201cI bet Dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to, Ron,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry. \u201cHe\u2019s really very busy at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cHE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d roared Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\n\nOver the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news, wringing Harry\u2019s hand and beaming just like the rest of them; soon, however, he was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to everybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his mother\u2019s room with Buckbeak.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you go feeling guilty!\u201d said Hermione sternly, after Harry had confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later. \u201cYou belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he\u2019s being selfish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit harsh, Hermione,\u201d said Ron, frowning as he attempted to prize off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his finger, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck inside this house without company.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have company!\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt\u2019s headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isn\u2019t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to live here with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true,\u201d said Harry, wringing out his cloth. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe just didn\u2019t want to get his own hopes up even more,\u201d said Hermione wisely. \u201cAnd he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I think a part of him was really hoping you\u2019d be expelled. Then you\u2019d both be outcasts together.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome off it!\u201d said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely shrugged.\n\n\u201cSuit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron\u2019s mum\u2019s right, and Sirius gets confused about whether you\u2019re you or your father, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you think he\u2019s touched in the head?\u201d said Harry heatedly.\n\n\u201cNo, I just think he\u2019s been very lonely for a long time,\u201d said Hermione simply.\n\nAt this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.\n\n\u201cStill not finished?\u201d she said, poking her head into the cupboard.\n\n\u201cI thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!\u201d said Ron bitterly. \u201cD\u2019you know how much mold we\u2019ve got rid of since we arrived here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were so keen to help the Order,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, \u201cyou can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like a house-elf,\u201d grumbled Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps you\u2019ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!\u201d said Hermione hopefully, as Mrs. Weasley left them to it again. \u201cYou know, maybe it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time \u2014 we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room, all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,\u201d Ron muttered irritably, but only so Harry could hear him.\n\nHarry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the Herbology greenhouses. It would be a treat just to leave this dusty, musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius.\n\nThe fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would have expected before he\u2019d experienced it. Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for meals, sometimes only for a few minutes\u2019 whispered conversation, Mrs. Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival.\n\nOn the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig\u2019s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.\n\n\u201cBooklists have arrived,\u201d he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to Harry, who was standing on a chair. \u201cAbout time, I thought they\u2019d forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this . . .\u201d\n\nHarry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over Ron\u2019s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner, which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It contained two pieces of parchment, one the usual reminder that term started on the first of September, the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year.\n\n\u201cOnly two new ones,\u201d he said, reading the list. \u201cThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert Slinkhard.\u201d\n\nCrack.\n\nFred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to them doing this by now that he didn\u2019t even fall off his chair.\n\n\u201cWe were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,\u201d said Fred conversationally.\n\n\u201cBecause it means Dumbledore\u2019s found a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cAnd about time too,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d Harry asked, jumping down beside them.\n\n\u201cWell, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back,\u201d Fred told Harry, \u201cand from what they were saying, Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot surprising, is it, when you look at what\u2019s happened to the last four?\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cOne sacked, one dead, one\u2019s memory removed, and one locked in a trunk for nine months,\u201d said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. \u201cYeah, I see what you mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, Ron?\u201d asked Fred.\n\nRon did not answer. Harry looked around. Ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment.\n\nFred\u2019s mouth fell open too.\n\n\u201cPrefect?\u201d he said, staring incredulously at the letter. \u201cPrefect?\u201d\n\nGeorge leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron\u2019s other hand, and turned it upside down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into George\u2019s palm.\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d said George in a hushed voice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a mistake,\u201d said Fred, snatching the letter out of Ron\u2019s grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark. \u201cNo one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . .\u201d\n\nThe twins\u2019 heads turned in unison and both of them stared at Harry.\n\n\u201cWe thought you were a cert!\u201d said Fred in a tone that suggested Harry had tricked them in some way.\n\n\u201cWe thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!\u201d said George indignantly.\n\n\u201cWinning the Triwizard and everything!\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cI suppose all the mad stuff must\u2019ve counted against him,\u201d said George to Fred.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Fred slowly. \u201cYeah, you\u2019ve caused too much trouble, mate. Well, at least one of you\u2019s got their priorities right.\u201d\n\nHe strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving Ron a scathing look.\n\n\u201cPrefect . . . ickle Ronnie the prefect . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Mum\u2019s going to be revolting,\u201d groaned George, thrusting the prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.\n\nRon, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for a moment, and then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large P was superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on Percy\u2019s chest on his very first day at Hogwarts.\n\nThe door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.\n\n\u201cDid you \u2014 did you get \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nShe spotted the badge in Harry\u2019s hand and let out a shriek.\n\n\u201cI knew it!\u201d she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. \u201cMe too, Harry, me too!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s Ron, not me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt \u2014 what?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon\u2019s prefect, not me,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cRon?\u201d said Hermione, her jaw dropping. \u201cBut . . . are you sure? I mean \u2014\u201d\n\nShe turned red as Ron looked around at her with a defiant expression on his face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my name on the letter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI . . .\u201d said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. \u201cI . . . well . . . wow! Well done, Ron! That\u2019s really \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cUnexpected,\u201d said George, nodding.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, \u201cno, it\u2019s not . . . Ron\u2019s done loads of . . . he\u2019s really . . .\u201d\n\nThe door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.\n\n\u201cGinny said the booklists had come at last,\u201d she said, glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles. \u201cIf you give them to me I\u2019ll take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while you\u2019re packing. Ron, I\u2019ll have to get you more pajamas, these are at least six inches too short, I can\u2019t believe how fast you\u2019re growing . . . what color would you like?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet him red and gold to match his badge,\u201d said George, smirking.\n\n\u201cMatch his what?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on Ron\u2019s pile.\n\n\u201cHis badge,\u201d said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over quickly. \u201cHis lovely shiny new prefect\u2019s badge.\u201d\n\nFred\u2019s words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. Weasley\u2019s preoccupation about pajamas.\n\n\u201cHis . . . but . . . Ron, you\u2019re not . . . ?\u201d\n\nRon held up his badge.\n\nMrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it! I don\u2019t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That\u2019s everyone in the family!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?\u201d said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.\n\n\u201cWait until your father hears! Ron, I\u2019m so proud of you, what wonderful news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it\u2019s the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry, I\u2019m just thrilled, oh Ronnie \u2014\u201d\n\nFred and George were both making loud retching noises behind her back but Mrs. Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron\u2019s neck, she was kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge.\n\n\u201cMum . . . don\u2019t . . . Mum, get a grip . . .\u201d he muttered, trying to push her away.\n\nShe let go of him and said breathlessly, \u201cWell, what will it be? We gave Percy an owl, but you\u2019ve already got one, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d said Ron, looking as though he did not dare believe his ears.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a reward for this!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley fondly. \u201cHow about a nice new set of dress robes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already bought him some,\u201d said Fred sourly, who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity.\n\n\u201cOr a new cauldron, Charlie\u2019s old one\u2019s rusting through, or a new rat, you always liked Scabbers \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMum,\u201d said Ron hopefully, \u201ccan I have a new broom?\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley\u2019s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive.\n\n\u201cNot a really good one!\u201d Ron hastened to add. \u201cJust \u2014 just a new one for a change . . .\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled.\n\n\u201cOf course you can. . . . Well, I\u2019d better get going if I\u2019ve got a broom to buy too. I\u2019ll see you all later. . . . Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don\u2019t forget to pack your trunks. . . . A prefect . . . Oh, I\u2019m all of a dither!\u201d\n\nShe gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bustled from the room.\n\nFred and George exchanged looks.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if we don\u2019t kiss you, do you, Ron?\u201d said Fred in a falsely anxious voice.\n\n\u201cWe could curtsy, if you like,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d said Ron, scowling at them.\n\n\u201cOr what?\u201d said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. \u201cGoing to put us in detention?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see him try,\u201d sniggered George.\n\n\u201cHe could if you don\u2019t watch out!\u201d said Hermione angrily, at which Fred and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, \u201cDrop it, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to watch our step, George,\u201d said Fred, pretending to tremble, \u201cwith these two on our case . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,\u201d said George, shaking his head.\n\nAnd with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated.\n\n\u201cThose two!\u201d said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling, through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with laughter in the room upstairs. \u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to them, Ron, they\u2019re only jealous!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are,\u201d said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the ceiling. \u201cThey\u2019ve always said only prats become prefects. . . . Still,\u201d he added on a happier note, \u201cthey\u2019ve never had new brooms! I wish I could go with Mum and choose. . . . She\u2019ll never be able to afford a Nimbus, but there\u2019s the new Cleansweep out, that\u2019d be great. . . . Yeah, I think I\u2019ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she knows . . .\u201d\n\nHe dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.\n\nFor some reason, Harry found that he did not want to look at Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes Mrs. Weasley had laid upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d said Hermione tentatively.\n\n\u201cWell done,\u201d said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all, and still not looking at her. \u201cBrilliant. Prefect. Great.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cErm \u2014 Harry \u2014 could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They\u2019ll be really pleased \u2014 I mean, prefect is something they can understand \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, no problem,\u201d said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him. \u201cTake her!\u201d\n\nHe leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it, and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.\n\nHe straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione and Hedwig had gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto it, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.\n\nHe had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way toward certain people. But if he had remembered . . . if he had thought about it . . . what would he have expected?\n\nNot this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head.\n\nHarry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to everyone else? Did he really believe he was better than Ron?\n\nNo, said the small voice defiantly.\n\nWas that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings.\n\nI\u2019m better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I\u2019m not better at anything else.\n\nThat was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron in lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adventures he, Ron, and Hermione had had together since they had started at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?\n\nWell, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice in Harry\u2019s head.\n\nNot all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn\u2019t fight Quirrell with me. They didn\u2019t take on Riddle and the basilisk. They didn\u2019t get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren\u2019t in that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned. . . .\n\nAnd the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again. I\u2019ve definitely done more, Harry thought indignantly. I\u2019ve done more than either of them!\n\nBut maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn\u2019t choose prefects because they\u2019ve got themselves into a load of dangerous situations. . . . Maybe he chooses them for other reasons. . . . Ron must have something you don\u2019t. . . .\n\nHarry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe\u2019s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.\n\n\u201cNo one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect . . .\u201d\n\nHarry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened with himself.\n\nRon had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This was not Ron\u2019s fault. Was he, Harry, Ron\u2019s best friend in the world, going to sulk because he didn\u2019t have a badge, laugh with the twins behind Ron\u2019s back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had beaten Harry at something?\n\nAt this point Harry heard Ron\u2019s footsteps on the stairs again. He stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as Ron bounded back through the door.\n\n\u201cJust caught her!\u201d he said happily. \u201cShe says she\u2019ll get the Cleansweep if she can.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty. \u201cListen \u2014 Ron \u2014 well done, mate.\u201d\n\nThe smile faded off Ron\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI never thought it would be me!\u201d he said, shaking his head, \u201cI thought it would be you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ve caused too much trouble,\u201d Harry said, echoing Fred.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, \u201cyeah, I suppose. . . . Well, we\u2019d better get our trunks packed, hadn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nIt was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron kept moving his prefect\u2019s badge around, first placing it on his bedside table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.\n\nMrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o\u2019clock, laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing.\n\n\u201cNever mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I want you all downstairs,\u201d she said, but the moment she was out of sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face.\n\nDown in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table, which read CONGRATULATIONS RON AND HERMIONE \u2014 NEW PREFECTS. She looked in a better mood than Harry had seen her all holiday.\n\n\u201cI thought we\u2019d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,\u201d she told Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the room. \u201cYour father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I\u2019ve sent them both owls and they\u2019re thrilled,\u201d she added, beaming.\n\nFred rolled his eyes.\n\nSirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself a butterbeer.\n\n\u201cOh, Alastor, I am glad you\u2019re here,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as Mad-Eye shrugged off his traveling cloak. \u201cWe\u2019ve been wanting to ask you for ages \u2014 could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what\u2019s inside it? We haven\u2019t wanted to open it just in case it\u2019s something really nasty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem, Molly . . .\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen.\n\n\u201cDrawing room . . .\u201d he growled, as the pupil contracted. \u201cDesk in the corner? Yeah, I see it. . . . Yeah, it\u2019s a boggart. . . . Want me to go up and get rid of it, Molly?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll do it myself later,\u201d beamed Mrs. Weasley. \u201cYou have your drink. We\u2019re having a little bit of a celebration, actually . . .\u201d She gestured at the scarlet banner. \u201cFourth prefect in the family!\u201d she said fondly, ruffling Ron\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cPrefect, eh?\u201d growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away toward Sirius and Lupin.\n\n\u201cWell, congratulations,\u201d said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his normal eye, \u201cauthority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldn\u2019t have appointed you . . .\u201d\n\nRon looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother. Mrs. Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought Mundungus with them too; he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with Moody\u2019s traveling cloak.\n\n\u201cWell, I think a toast is in order,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, when everyone had a drink. He raised his goblet. \u201cTo Ron and Hermione, the new Gryffindor prefects!\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded.\n\n\u201cI was never a prefect myself,\u201d said Tonks brightly from behind Harry as everybody moved toward the table to help themselves to food. Her hair was tomato-red and waist length today; she looked like Ginny\u2019s older sister. \u201cMy Head of House said I lacked certain necessary qualities.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.\n\n\u201cLike the ability to behave myself,\u201d said Tonks.\n\nGinny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Sirius?\u201d Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on the back.\n\nSirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual barklike laugh.\n\n\u201cNo one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cI need scarcely say that I failed dismally.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.\n\nRon was rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would listen.\n\n\u201c. . . naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you think the Comet Two Ninety\u2019s only naught to sixty and that\u2019s with a decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?\u201d\n\nHermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf rights.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation, isn\u2019t it? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they\u2019re superior to other creatures . . .\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201c. . . getting really out of hand, and you\u2019re so good-looking, it would look much better shorter, wouldn\u2019t it, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 I dunno \u2014\u201d said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George, who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.\n\nMundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked and beckoned Harry closer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he told Mundungus, \u201cwe can trust Harry, he\u2019s our financial backer.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook what Dung\u2019s gotten us,\u201d said George, holding out his hand to Harry. It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods. A faint rattling noise was coming from them, even though they were completely stationary.\n\n\u201cVenomous Tentacula seeds,\u201d said George. \u201cWe need them for the Skiving Snackboxes but they\u2019re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so we\u2019ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen Galleons the lot, then, Dung?\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cWiv all the trouble I went to to get \u2019em?\u201d said Mundungus, his saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, lads, but I\u2019m not taking a Knut under twenty.\u201d\n\n\u201cDung likes his little joke,\u201d Fred said to Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl quills,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d Harry warned them quietly.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Fred. \u201cMum\u2019s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Moody could have his eye on you,\u201d Harry pointed out.\n\nMundungus looked nervously over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cGood point, that,\u201d he grunted. \u201cAll right, lads, ten it is, if you\u2019ll take \u2019em quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheers, Harry!\u201d said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins\u2019 outstretched hands and scuttled off toward the food. \u201cWe\u2019d better get these upstairs . . .\u201d\n\nHarry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was inevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but what if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement? Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?\n\nStanding where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound of his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt\u2019s deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter.\n\n\u201c. . . why Dumbledore didn\u2019t make Potter a prefect?\u201d said Kingsley.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have had his reasons,\u201d replied Lupin.\n\n\u201cBut it would\u2019ve shown confidence in him. It\u2019s what I\u2019d\u2019ve done,\u201d persisted Kingsley, \u201c\u2019specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at him every few days . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not look around; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to know he had heard. He followed Mundungus back toward the table, though not remotely hungry. His pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.\n\nMad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth.\n\n\u201c. . . the handle\u2019s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and in-built vibration control \u2014\u201d Ron was saying to Tonks.\n\nMrs. Weasley yawned widely.\n\n\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll sort out that boggart before I turn in. . . . Arthur, I don\u2019t want this lot up too late, all right? \u2019Night, Harry, dear.\u201d\n\nShe left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention.\n\n\u201cYou all right, Potter?\u201d grunted Moody.\n\n\u201cYeah, fine,\u201d lied Harry.\n\nMoody took a swig from his hip flask, his electric blue eye staring sideways at Harry.\n\n\u201cCome here, I\u2019ve got something that might interest you,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old Wizarding photograph.\n\n\u201cOriginal Order of the Phoenix,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cFound it last night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as Podmore hasn\u2019t had the manners to return my best one. . . . Thought people might like to see it.\u201d\n\nHarry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving at him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s me,\u201d said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at himself. The Moody in the picture was unmistakable, though his hair was slightly less gray and his nose was intact. \u201cAnd there\u2019s Dumbledore beside me, Dedalus Diggle on the other side . . . That\u2019s Marlene McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken, they got her whole family. That\u2019s Frank and Alice Longbottom \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at Alice Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even though he had never met her, because she was the image of her son, Neville.\n\n\u201cPoor devils,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cBetter dead than what happened to them . . . and that\u2019s Emmeline Vance, you\u2019ve met her, and that there\u2019s Lupin, obviously . . . Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only ever found bits of him . . . shift aside there,\u201d he added, poking the picture, and the little photographic people edged sideways, so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Edgar Bones . . . brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and his family too, he was a great wizard . . . Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he looks young . . . Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we never found his body . . . Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as ever . . . Elphias Doge, you\u2019ve met him, I\u2019d forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat . . . Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes . . . budge along, budge along . . .\u201d\n\nThe little people in the photograph jostled among themselves, and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him, strange bloke . . . That\u2019s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her personally . . . Sirius, when he still had short hair . . . and . . . there you go, thought that would interest you!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up at him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry recognized at once as Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped bring about their deaths.\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d said Moody.\n\nHarry looked up into Moody\u2019s heavily scarred and pitted face. Evidently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit of a treat.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, attempting to grin again. \u201cEr . . . listen, I\u2019ve just remembered, I haven\u2019t packed my . . .\u201d\n\nHe was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed; Sirius had just said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Mad-Eye?\u201d and Moody had turned toward him. Harry crossed the kitchen, slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back.\n\nHe did not know why he had received such a shock; he had seen his parents\u2019 pictures before, after all, and he had met Wormtail . . . but to have them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it . . . No one would like that, he thought angrily. . . .\n\nAnd then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces . . . Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into madness . . . all waving happily out of the photograph forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed. . . . Well, Moody might find that interesting . . . he, Harry, found it disturbing. . . .\n\nHarry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads, glad to be on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Harry said.\n\nThere was no answer but the sobbing continued. He climbed the remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing, and opened the drawing-room door.\n\nSomeone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her hand, her whole body shaking with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.\n\nAll the air seemed to vanish from Harry\u2019s lungs; he felt as though he were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold \u2014 Ron dead, no, it couldn\u2019t be \u2014\n\nBut wait a moment, it couldn\u2019t be \u2014 Ron was downstairs \u2014\n\n\u201cMrs. Weasley?\u201d Harry croaked.\n\n\u201cR-r-riddikulus!\u201d Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her shaking wand at Ron\u2019s body.\n\nCrack.\n\nRon\u2019s body turned into Bill\u2019s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes wide open and empty. Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever.\n\n\u201cR-riddikulus!\u201d she sobbed again.\n\nCrack.\n\nMr. Weasley\u2019s body replaced Bill\u2019s, his glasses askew, a trickle of blood running down his face.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Mrs. Weasley moaned. \u201cNo . . . riddikulus! Riddikulus! RIDDIKULUS!\u201d\n\nCrack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry . . .\n\n\u201cMrs. Weasley, just get out of here!\u201d shouted Harry, staring down at his own dead body on the floor. \u201cLet someone else \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nLupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius, with Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs. Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant. Pulling out his own wand he said, very firmly and clearly, \u201cRiddikulus!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 oh \u2014 oh!\u201d gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she broke into a storm of crying, her face in her hands.\n\n\u201cMolly,\u201d said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, \u201cMolly, don\u2019t . . .\u201d\n\nNext second she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cMolly, it was just a boggart,\u201d he said soothingly, patting her on the head. \u201cJust a stupid boggart . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI see them d-d-dead all the time!\u201d Mrs. Weasley moaned into his shoulder. \u201cAll the t-t-time! I d-d-dream about it . . .\u201d\n\nSirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart, pretending to be Harry\u2019s body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry, who avoided his gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody\u2019s magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen.\n\n\u201cD-d-don\u2019t tell Arthur,\u201d Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs. \u201cI d-d-don\u2019t want him to know. . . . Being silly . . .\u201d\n\nLupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m so sorry, what must you think of me?\u201d she said shakily. \u201cNot even able to get rid of a boggart . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d said Harry, trying to smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just s-s-so worried,\u201d she said, tears spilling out of her eyes again. \u201cHalf the f-f-family\u2019s in the Order, it\u2019ll b-b-be a miracle if we all come through this. . . . and P-P-Percy\u2019s not talking to us. . . . What if something d-d-dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up? And what\u2019s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who\u2019s g-g-going to look after Ron and Ginny?\u201d\n\n\u201cMolly, that\u2019s enough,\u201d said Lupin firmly. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like last time. The Order is better prepared, we\u2019ve got a head start, we know what Voldemort\u2019s up to \u2014\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.\n\n\u201cOh, Molly, come on, it\u2019s about time you got used to hearing it \u2014 look, I can\u2019t promise no one\u2019s going to get hurt, nobody can promise that, but we\u2019re much better off than we were last time, you weren\u2019t in the Order then, you don\u2019t understand, last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one . . .\u201d\n\nHarry thought of the photograph again, of his parents\u2019 beaming faces. He knew Moody was still watching him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Percy,\u201d said Sirius abruptly. \u201cHe\u2019ll come round. It\u2019s a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he does, the whole Ministry\u2019s going to be begging us to forgive them. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be accepting their apology,\u201d he added bitterly.\n\n\u201cAnd as for who\u2019s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died,\u201d said Lupin, smiling slightly, \u201cwhat do you think we\u2019d do, let them starve?\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.\n\n\u201cBeing silly,\u201d she muttered again, mopping her eyes.\n\nBut Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his parents beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes.\n\nWithout warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly.\n\n\u201cCut it out,\u201d he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded again.\n\n\u201cFirst sign of madness, talking to your own head,\u201d said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall.\n\nHarry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life, and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect\u2019s badge."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter10": "LUNA LOVEGOOD\n\n\n\n\nHarry had a troubled night\u2019s sleep. His parents wove in and out of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs. Weasley sobbed over Kreacher\u2019s dead body watched by Ron and Hermione, who were wearing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door. He awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him.\n\n\u201c. . . better hurry up, Mum\u2019s going ballistic, she says we\u2019re going to miss the train . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs. Black and Mrs. Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.\n\n\u201c\u2014 COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU IDIOTS \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as Harry was putting on his trainers; Hedwig was swaying on her shoulder, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms.\n\n\u201cMum and Dad just sent Hedwig back\u201d \u2014 the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage \u2014 \u201care you ready yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly \u2014 Ginny all right?\u201d Harry asked, shoving on his glasses.\n\n\u201cMrs. Weasley\u2019s patched her up,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut now Mad-Eye\u2019s complaining that we can\u2019t leave unless Sturgis Podmore\u2019s here, otherwise the guard will be one short.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuard?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe have to go to King\u2019s Cross with a guard?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to go to King\u2019s Cross with a guard,\u201d Hermione corrected him.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry irritably. \u201cI thought Voldemort was supposed to be lying low, or are you telling me he\u2019s going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just what Mad-Eye says,\u201d said Hermione distractedly, looking at her watch. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t leave soon we\u2019re definitely going to miss the train . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!\u201d Mrs. Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room. Harry seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage, and set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging his trunk.\n\nMrs. Black\u2019s portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her; all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again anyway.\n\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019re to come with me and Tonks,\u201d shouted Mrs. Weasley over the repeated screeches of \u201cMUDBLOODS! SCUM! CREATURES OF DIRT!\u201d \u201cLeave your trunk and your owl, Alastor\u2019s going to deal with the luggage. . . . Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!\u201d\n\nA bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry\u2019s side as Harry clambered over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cOh honestly . . .\u201d said Mrs. Weasley despairingly, \u201cwell, on your own head be it!\u201d\n\nShe wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak September sunlight. Harry and the dog followed her. The door slammed behind them and Mrs. Black\u2019s screeches were cut off instantly.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Tonks?\u201d Harry said, looking around as they went down the stone steps of number twelve, which vanished the moment they reached the pavement.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s waiting for us just up here,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry.\n\nAn old woman greeted them on the corner. She had tightly curled gray hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a porkpie.\n\n\u201cWotcher, Harry,\u201d she said, winking. \u201cBetter hurry up, hadn\u2019t we, Molly?\u201d she added, checking her watch.\n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d moaned Mrs. Weasley, lengthening her stride, \u201cbut Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis. . . . If only Arthur could have got us cars from the Ministry again . . . but Fudge wouldn\u2019t let him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days. . . . How Muggles can stand traveling without magic . . .\u201d\n\nBut the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gamboled around them, snapping at pigeons, and chasing its own tail. Harry couldn\u2019t help laughing. Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time. Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips in an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way.\n\nIt took them twenty minutes to reach King\u2019s Cross by foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring a couple of cats for Harry\u2019s entertainment. Once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through onto platform nine and three quarters, where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families. Harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really going back. . . .\n\n\u201cI hope the others make it in time,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, staring behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform, through which new arrivals would come.\n\n\u201cNice dog, Harry!\u201d called a tall boy with dreadlocks.\n\n\u201cThanks, Lee,\u201d said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail frantically.\n\n\u201cOh good,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, \u201chere\u2019s Alastor with the luggage, look . . .\u201d\n\nA porter\u2019s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came limping through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.\n\n\u201cAll okay,\u201d he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. \u201cDon\u2019t think we were followed . . .\u201d\n\nSeconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron and Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody\u2019s luggage cart when Fred, George, and Ginny turned up with Lupin.\n\n\u201cNo trouble?\u201d growled Moody.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,\u201d said Moody. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time he\u2019s not turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as Mundungus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, look after yourselves,\u201d said Lupin, shaking hands all round. He reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder. \u201cYou too, Harry. Be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,\u201d said Moody, shaking Harry\u2019s hand too. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget, all of you \u2014 careful what you put in writing. If in doubt, don\u2019t put it in a letter at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great meeting all of you,\u201d said Tonks, hugging Hermione and Ginny. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you soon, I expect.\u201d\n\nA warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform started hurrying onto the train.\n\n\u201cQuick, quick,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, hugging them at random and catching Harry twice. \u201cWrite . . . Be good. . . . If you\u2019ve forgotten anything we\u2019ll send it on. . . . Onto the train, now, hurry . . .\u201d\n\nFor one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto its hind legs and placed its front paws on Harry\u2019s shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley shoved Harry away toward the train door hissing, \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake act more like a dog, Sirius!\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you!\u201d Harry called out of the open window as the train began to move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny waved beside him. The figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wagging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train, and then they turned the corner, and Sirius was gone.\n\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have come with us,\u201d said Hermione in a worried voice.\n\n\u201cOh lighten up,\u201d said Ron, \u201che hasn\u2019t seen daylight for months, poor bloke.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Fred, clapping his hands together, \u201ccan\u2019t stand around chatting all day, we\u2019ve got business to discuss with Lee. See you later,\u201d and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right.\n\nThe train was gathering still more speed, so that the houses outside the window flashed past and they swayed where they stood.\n\n\u201cShall we go and find a compartment, then?\u201d Harry asked Ron and Hermione.\n\nRon and Hermione exchanged looks.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re \u2014 well \u2014 Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect carriage,\u201d Hermione said awkwardly.\n\nRon wasn\u2019t looking at Harry; he seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on his left hand.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry. \u201cRight. Fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to stay there all journey,\u201d said Hermione quickly. \u201cOur letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Harry again. \u201cWell, I-I might see you later, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s a pain having to go down there, I\u2019d rather \u2014 but we have to \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m not enjoying it, I\u2019m not Percy,\u201d he finished defiantly.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re not,\u201d said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss. He had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Ginny told him, \u201cif we get a move on we\u2019ll be able to save them places.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, picking up Hedwig\u2019s cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor, peering through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments they passed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbors and pointed him out. After he had met this behavior in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying show-off he was. He wondered bleakly whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.\n\nIn the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry\u2019s fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his struggling toad, Trevor.\n\n\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d he panted. \u201cHi, Ginny. . . . Everywhere\u2019s full. . . . I can\u2019t find a seat . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Ginny, who had squeezed past Neville to peer into the compartment behind him. \u201cThere\u2019s room in this one, there\u2019s only Loony Lovegood in here \u2014\u201d\n\nNeville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d said Ginny, laughing, \u201cshe\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\nShe slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it. Harry and Neville followed.\n\n\u201cHi, Luna,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cIs it okay if we take these seats?\u201d\n\nThe girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waist-length, dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of butterbeer caps, or that she was reading a magazine upside down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry. She nodded.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Ginny, smiling at her.\n\nHarry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig\u2019s cage in the luggage rack and sat down. The girl called Luna watched them over her upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. She stared and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he had not.\n\n\u201cHad a good summer, Luna?\u201d Ginny asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. \u201cYes, it was quite enjoyable, you know. You\u2019re Harry Potter,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI know I am,\u201d said Harry.\n\nNeville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes upon him instead.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nobody,\u201d said Neville hurriedly.\n\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d said Ginny sharply. \u201cNeville Longbottom \u2014 Luna Lovegood. Luna\u2019s in my year, but in Ravenclaw.\u201d\n\n\u201cWit beyond measure is man\u2019s greatest treasure,\u201d said Luna in a singsong voice.\n\nShe raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.\n\nThe train rattled onward, speeding them out into open country. It was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously gray clouds.\n\n\u201cGuess what I got for my birthday?\u201d said Neville.\n\n\u201cAnother Remembrall?\u201d said Harry, remembering the marblelike device Neville\u2019s grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Neville, \u201cI could do with one, though, I lost the old one ages ago. . . . No, look at this . . .\u201d\n\nHe dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small gray cactus in a pot, except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines.\n\n\u201cMimbulus mimbletonia,\u201d he said proudly.\n\nHarry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really, really rare,\u201d said Neville, beaming. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can\u2019t wait to show it to Professor Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria. I\u2019m going to see if I can breed from it.\u201d\n\nHarry knew that Neville\u2019s favorite subject was Herbology, but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant.\n\n\u201cDoes it \u2014 er \u2014 do anything?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cLoads of stuff!\u201d said Neville proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s got an amazing defensive mechanism \u2014 hold Trevor for me . . .\u201d\n\nHe dumped the toad into Harry\u2019s lap and took a quill from his schoolbag. Luna Lovegood\u2019s popping eyes appeared over the top of her upside-down magazine again, watching what Neville was doing. Neville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill.\n\nLiquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, dark-green jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna Lovegood\u2019s magazine. Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing the escape of Trevor, received a face full. It smelled like rancid manure.\n\nNeville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes.\n\n\u201cS-sorry,\u201d he gasped. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried that before. . . . Didn\u2019t realize it would be quite so . . . Don\u2019t worry, though, Stinksap\u2019s not poisonous,\u201d he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful onto the floor.\n\nAt that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.\n\n\u201cOh . . . hello, Harry,\u201d said a nervous voice. \u201cUm . . . bad time?\u201d\n\nHarry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.\n\n\u201cOh . . . hi,\u201d said Harry blankly.\n\n\u201cUm . . .\u201d said Cho. \u201cWell . . . just thought I\u2019d say hello . . . \u2019bye then.\u201d\n\nShe closed the door again, rather pink in the face, and departed. Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap.\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Ginny bracingly. \u201cLook, we can get rid of all this easily.\u201d She pulled out her wand. \u201cScourgify!\u201d\n\nThe Stinksap vanished.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Neville again, in a small voice.\n\nRon and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville had finished their Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig, grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the Frog\u2019s head, and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning.\n\n\u201cWell, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,\u201d said Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. \u201cBoy and girl from each.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd guess who\u2019s a Slytherin prefect?\u201d said Ron, still with his eyes closed.\n\n\u201cMalfoy,\u201d replied Harry at once, his worst fear confirmed.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his mouth and taking another.\n\n\u201cAnd that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,\u201d said Hermione viciously. \u201cHow she got to be a prefect when she\u2019s thicker than a concussed troll . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Hufflepuff?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cErnie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,\u201d said Ron thickly.\n\n\u201cAnd Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,\u201d said a vague voice.\n\nEveryone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was gazing unblinkingly at Ron over the top of The Quibbler. He swallowed his mouthful of Frog.\n\n\u201cYeah, I know I did,\u201d he said, looking mildly surprised.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t enjoy it very much,\u201d Luna informed him. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t think you treated her very well, because you wouldn\u2019t dance with her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have minded,\u201d she added thoughtfully, \u201cI don\u2019t like dancing very much.\u201d\n\nShe retreated behind The Quibbler again. Ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling. Ron shook his head, bemused, then checked his watch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,\u201d he told Harry and Neville, \u201cand we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving. I can\u2019t wait to get Crabbe and Goyle for something . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to abuse your position, Ron!\u201d said Hermione sharply.\n\n\u201cYeah, right, because Malfoy won\u2019t abuse it at all,\u201d said Ron sarcastically.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re going to descend to his level?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m just going to make sure I get his mates before he gets mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make Goyle do lines, it\u2019ll kill him, he hates writing,\u201d said Ron happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle\u2019s low grunt and, screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. \u201cI . . . must . . . not . . . look . . . like . . . a . . . baboon\u2019s . . . backside . . .\u201d\n\nEveryone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood. She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack, hissing. She laughed so hard that her magazine slipped out of her grasp, slid down her legs, and onto the floor.\n\n\u201cThat was funny!\u201d\n\nHer prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were now laughing at the expression on Ron\u2019s face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and forward, clutching her sides.\n\n\u201cAre you taking the mickey?\u201d said Ron, frowning at her.\n\n\u201cBaboon\u2019s . . . backside!\u201d she choked, holding her ribs.\n\nEveryone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at the magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for it. Upside down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was, but Harry now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius Fudge; Harry only recognized him because of the lime-green bowler hat. One of Fudge\u2019s hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the other hand was throttling a goblin. The cartoon was captioned: HOW FAR WILL FUDGE GO TO GAIN GRINGOTTS?\n\nBeneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine.\n\nCORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE:\n\nHow the Tornados Are Taking Control\n\n\n\nSECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUNES REVEALED\n\n\n\nSIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim?\n\n\n\n\u201cCan I have a look at this?\u201d Harry asked Luna eagerly.\n\nShe nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter.\n\nHarry opened the magazine and scanned the index; until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The Quibbler. He found the page and turned excitedly to the article.\n\nThis too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in fact, Harry would not have known it was supposed to be Sirius if it hadn\u2019t been captioned. Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out. The headline on the article read:\n\nSIRIUS \u2014 Black As He\u2019s Painted?\n\nNotorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation?\n\n\n\nHarry had to read this sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it. Since when had Sirius been a singing sensation?\n\nFor fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Muggles and one wizard. Black\u2019s audacious escape from Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic. None of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors.\n\nBUT DOES HE?\n\nStartling new evidence has recently come to light that Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to Azkaban. In fact, says Doris Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may not even have been present at the killings.\n\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t realize is that Sirius Black is a false name,\u201d says Mrs. Purkiss. \u201cThe man people believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of the popular singing group The Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being struck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago. I recognized him the moment I saw his picture in the paper. Now, Stubby couldn\u2019t possibly have committed those crimes, because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me. I have written to the Minister of Magic and am expecting him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any day now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief. Perhaps it was a joke, he thought, perhaps the magazine often printed spoof items. He flicked back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge.\n\nCornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, denied that he had any plans to take over the running of the Wizarding bank, Gringotts, when he was elected Minister of Magic five years ago. Fudge has always insisted that he wants nothing more than to \u201ccooperate peacefully\u201d with the guardians of our gold.\n\nBUT DOES HE?\n\nSources close to the Minister have recently disclosed that Fudge\u2019s dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will not hesitate to use force if need be.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time, either,\u201d said a Ministry insider. \u201cCornelius \u2018Goblin-Crusher\u2019 Fudge, that\u2019s what his friends call him, if you could hear him when he thinks no one\u2019s listening, oh, he\u2019s always talking about the goblins he\u2019s had done in; he\u2019s had them drowned, he\u2019s had them dropped off buildings, he\u2019s had them poisoned, he\u2019s had them cooked in pies . . .\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but Harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in pies. He flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing every few pages he read an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal broom-tampering, and torture; an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes, which at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler upside down. According to the magazine, if you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemy\u2019s ears turn into kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler, the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The Hobgoblins was quite sensible.\n\n\u201cAnything good in there?\u201d asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer, \u201cThe Quibbler\u2019s rubbish, everyone knows that.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality. \u201cMy father\u2019s the editor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 oh,\u201d said Hermione, looking embarrassed. \u201cWell . . . it\u2019s got some interesting . . . I mean, it\u2019s quite . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have it back, thank you,\u201d said Luna coldly, and leaning forward she snatched it out of Harry\u2019s hands. Rifling through it to page fifty-seven, she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time.\n\nHarry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth.\n\n\u201cManners, Potter, or I\u2019ll have to give you a detention,\u201d drawled Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his father\u2019s. \u201cYou see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.\u201d\n\nRon, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed. Malfoy\u2019s lip curled.\n\n\u201cTell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cShut up, Malfoy,\u201d said Hermione sharply.\n\n\u201cI seem to have touched a nerve,\u201d said Malfoy, smirking. \u201cWell, just watch yourself, Potter, because I\u2019ll be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out!\u201d said Hermione, standing up.\n\nSniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed, Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his wake. Hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at Harry, who knew at once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy had said and been just as unnerved by it.\n\n\u201cChuck us another Frog,\u201d said Ron, who had clearly noticed nothing.\n\nHarry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. He exchanged another nervous look with Hermione and then stared out of the window.\n\nHe had thought Sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous. . . . Hermione had been right. . . . Sirius should not have come. What if Mr. Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco, what if he had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks, and Moody knew where Sirius was hiding? Or had Malfoy\u2019s use of the word \u201cdogging\u201d been a coincidence?\n\nThe weather remained undecided as they traveled farther and farther north. Rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way, then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more. When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna rolled up The Quibbler, put it carefully away in her bag, and took to staring at everyone in the compartment instead.\n\nHarry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better change,\u201d said Hermione at last. She and Ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests. Harry saw Ron checking how it looked in the black window.\n\nAt last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled, ready for departure. Ron and Hermione were supposed to supervise all this; they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll carry that owl, if you like,\u201d said Luna to Harry, reaching out for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 er \u2014 thanks,\u201d said Harry, handing her the cage and hoisting Hedwig\u2019s more securely into his arms.\n\nThey shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor. Slowly they moved toward the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake. He stepped down onto the platform and looked around, listening for the familiar call of \u201cFirs\u2019 years over here . . . firs\u2019 years . . .\u201d\n\nBut it did not come. Instead a quite different voice, a brisk female one, was calling, \u201cFirst years line up over here, please! All first years to me!\u201d\n\nA lantern came swinging toward Harry and by its light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the witch who had taken over Hagrid\u2019s Care of Magical Creatures lessons for a while the previous year.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Hagrid?\u201d he said out loud.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ginny, \u201cbut we\u2019d better get out of the way, we\u2019re blocking the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah . . .\u201d\n\nHarry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station. Jostled by the crowd, Harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be here, Harry had been relying on it \u2014 seeing Hagrid again had been one of the things to which he had been looking forward most. But there was no sign of him at all.\n\nHe can\u2019t have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd. He\u2019s just got a cold or something. . . .\n\nHe looked around for Ron or Hermione, wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but neither of them was anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade station.\n\nHere stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle. Harry glanced quickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and Hermione, then did a double take.\n\nThe coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures standing between the carriage shafts; if he had had to give them a name, he supposed he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible. Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and staring. Wings sprouted from each wither \u2014 vast, black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats. Standing still and quiet in the gloom, the creatures looked eerie and sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Pig?\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice, right behind Harry.\n\n\u201cThat Luna girl was carrying him,\u201d said Harry, turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about Hagrid. \u201cWhere d\u2019you reckon \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 Hagrid is? I dunno,\u201d said Ron, sounding worried. \u201cHe\u2019d better be okay . . .\u201d\n\nA short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing some timid-looking second years out of the way so that they could get a coach to themselves. Seconds later Hermione emerged panting from the crowd.\n\n\u201cMalfoy was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear I\u2019m going to report him, he\u2019s only had his badge three minutes and he\u2019s using it to bully people worse than ever. . . . Where\u2019s Crookshanks?\u201d\n\n\u201cGinny\u2019s got him,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere she is . . .\u201d\n\nGinny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming Crookshanks.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get a carriage together before they all fill up . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got Pig yet!\u201d Ron said, but Hermione was already heading off toward the nearest unoccupied coach. Harry remained behind with Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat are those things, d\u2019you reckon?\u201d he asked Ron, nodding at the horrible horses as the other students surged past them.\n\n\u201cWhat things?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose horse \u2014\u201d\n\nLuna appeared holding Pigwidgeon\u2019s cage in her arms; the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usual.\n\n\u201cHere you are,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a sweet little owl, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . yeah . . . He\u2019s all right,\u201d said Ron gruffly. \u201cWell, come on then, let\u2019s get in. . . . what were you saying, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was saying, what are those horse things?\u201d Harry said, as he, Ron, and Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were already sitting.\n\n\u201cWhat horse things?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe horse things pulling the carriages!\u201d said Harry impatiently; they were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was watching them with empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a perplexed look.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about \u2014 look!\u201d\n\nHarry grabbed Ron\u2019s arm and wheeled him about so that he was face-to-face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to be looking at?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the \u2014 there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It\u2019s right there in front \u2014\u201d\n\nBut as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred to Harry.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t . . . can\u2019t you see them?\u201d\n\n\u201cSee what?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you see what\u2019s pulling the carriages?\u201d\n\nRon looked seriously alarmed now.\n\n\u201cAre you feeling all right, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . yeah . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was there in front of him, gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows behind them, vapor rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air. Yet unless Ron was faking \u2014 and it was a very feeble joke if he was \u2014 Ron could not see it at all.\n\n\u201cShall we get in, then?\u201d said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as though worried about him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYeah, go on . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron vanished into the coach\u2019s dark interior. \u201cYou\u2019re not going mad or anything. I can see them too.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you?\u201d said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see the bat-winged horses reflected in her wide, silvery eyes.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Luna, \u201cI\u2019ve been able to see them ever since my first day here. They\u2019ve always pulled the carriages. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re just as sane as I am.\u201d\n\nSmiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after Ron. Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter11": "THE SORTING HAT\u2019S NEW SONG\n\n\n\n\nHarry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna were having the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so he said nothing about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him. Nevertheless, he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window.\n\n\u201cDid everyone see that Grubbly-Plank woman?\u201d asked Ginny. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing back here? Hagrid can\u2019t have left, can he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be quite glad if he has,\u201d said Luna. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a very good teacher, is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he is!\u201d said Harry, Ron, and Ginny angrily.\n\nHarry glared at Hermione; she cleared her throat and quickly said, \u201cErm . . . yes . . . he\u2019s very good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we think he\u2019s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,\u201d said Luna, unfazed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,\u201d Ron snapped, as the wheels below them creaked into motion.\n\nLuna did not seem perturbed by Ron\u2019s rudeness; on the contrary, she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television program.\n\nRattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road. When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned forward to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid\u2019s cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete darkness. Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering mass of turrets, jet-black against the dark sky, here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them.\n\nThe carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first. He turned again to look for lit windows down by the forest, but there was definitely no sign of life within Hagrid\u2019s cabin. Unwillingly, because he had half hoped they would have vanished, he turned his eyes instead upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air, their blank white eyes gleaming.\n\nHarry had once before had the experience of seeing something that Ron could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages. If Luna was to be believed, the beasts had always been there but invisible; why, then, could Harry suddenly see them, and why could Ron not?\n\n\u201cAre you coming or what?\u201d said Ron beside him.\n\n\u201cOh . . . yeah,\u201d said Harry quickly, and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.\n\nThe entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term feast.\n\nThe four long House tables in the Great Hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in midair all along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly to one another, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from other Houses, eyeing one another\u2019s new haircuts and robes. Again Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared.\n\nLuna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment they reached Gryffindor\u2019s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave Harry airy, overly friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before. He had more important things to worry about, however: He was looking over the students\u2019 heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real need; Hagrid\u2019s size made him instantly obvious in any lineup.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t have left,\u201d said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.\n\n\u201cOf course he hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry firmly.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s . . . hurt, or anything, do you?\u201d said Hermione uneasily.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry at once.\n\n\u201cBut where is he, then?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville, Parvati, and Lavender could not hear, \u201cMaybe he\u2019s not back yet. You know \u2014 from his mission \u2014 the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . yeah, that\u2019ll be it,\u201d said Ron, sounding reassured, but Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she said sharply, pointing toward the middle of the staff table.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes followed hers. They lit first upon Professor Dumbledore, sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the center of the long staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat. Dumbledore\u2019s head was inclined toward the woman sitting next to him, who was talking into his ear. She looked, Harry thought, like somebody\u2019s maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly, mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes. Then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw, with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that Umbridge woman!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cShe was at my hearing, she works for Fudge!\u201d\n\n\u201cNice cardigan,\u201d said Ron, smirking.\n\n\u201cShe works for Fudge?\u201d Hermione repeated, frowning. \u201cWhat on earth\u2019s she doing here, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno . . .\u201d\n\nHermione scanned the staff table, her eyes narrowed.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered, \u201cno, surely not . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask; his attention had just been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrid\u2019s. That meant that the first years must have crossed the lake and reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors from the entrance hall opened. A long line of scared-looking first years entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizard\u2019s hat, heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim.\n\nThe buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first years lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then stood back.\n\nThe first years\u2019 faces glowed palely in the candlelight. A small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling. Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he had felt when he had stood there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which House he belonged.\n\nThe whole school waited with bated breath. Then the rip near the hat\u2019s brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into song:\n\n\n\nIn times of old when I was new\n\nAnd Hogwarts barely started\n\nThe founders of our noble school\n\nThought never to be parted:\n\nUnited by a common goal,\n\nThey had the selfsame yearning,\n\nTo make the world\u2019s best magic school\n\nAnd pass along their learning.\n\n\u201cTogether we will build and teach!\u201d\n\nThe four good friends decided\n\nAnd never did they dream that they\n\nMight someday be divided,\n\nFor were there such friends anywhere\n\nAs Slytherin and Gryffindor?\n\nUnless it was the second pair\n\nOf Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?\n\nSo how could it have gone so wrong?\n\nHow could such friendships fail?\n\nWhy, I was there and so can tell\n\nThe whole sad, sorry tale.\n\nSaid Slytherin, \u201cWe\u2019ll teach just those\n\nWhose ancestry is purest.\u201d\n\nSaid Ravenclaw, \u201cWe\u2019ll teach those whose\n\nIntelligence is surest.\u201d\n\nSaid Gryffindor, \u201cWe\u2019ll teach all those\n\nWith brave deeds to their name.\u201d\n\nSaid Hufflepuff, \u201cI\u2019ll teach the lot,\n\nAnd treat them just the same.\u201d\n\nThese differences caused little strife\n\nWhen first they came to light,\n\nFor each of the four founders had\n\nA House in which they might\n\nTake only those they wanted, so,\n\nFor instance, Slytherin\n\nTook only pure-blood wizards\n\nOf great cunning, just like him,\n\nAnd only those of sharpest mind\n\nWere taught by Ravenclaw\n\nWhile the bravest and the boldest\n\nWent to daring Gryffindor.\n\nGood Hufflepuff, she took the rest,\n\nAnd taught them all she knew,\n\nThus the Houses and their founders\n\nRetained friendships firm and true.\n\nSo Hogwarts worked in harmony\n\nFor several happy years,\n\nBut then discord crept among us\n\nFeeding on our faults and fears.\n\nThe Houses that, like pillars four,\n\nHad once held up our school,\n\nNow turned upon each other and,\n\nDivided, sought to rule.\n\nAnd for a while it seemed the school\n\nMust meet an early end,\n\nWhat with dueling and with fighting\n\nAnd the clash of friend on friend\n\nAnd at last there came a morning\n\nWhen old Slytherin departed\n\nAnd though the fighting then died out\n\nHe left us quite downhearted.\n\nAnd never since the founders four\n\nWere whittled down to three\n\nHave the Houses been united\n\nAs they once were meant to be.\n\nAnd now the Sorting Hat is here\n\nAnd you all know the score:\n\nI sort you into Houses\n\nBecause that is what I\u2019m for,\n\nBut this year I\u2019ll go further,\n\nListen closely to my song:\n\nThough condemned I am to split you\n\nStill I worry that it\u2019s wrong,\n\nThough I must fulfill my duty\n\nAnd must quarter every year\n\nStill I wonder whether Sorting\n\nMay not bring the end I fear.\n\nOh, know the perils, read the signs,\n\nThe warning history shows,\n\nFor our Hogwarts is in danger\n\nFrom external, deadly foes\n\nAnd we must unite inside her\n\nOr we\u2019ll crumble from within.\n\nI have told you, I have warned you. . . .\n\nLet the Sorting now begin.\n\n\n\nThe hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though it was punctured, for the first time in Harry\u2019s memory, with muttering and whispers. All across the Great Hall students were exchanging remarks with their neighbors and Harry, clapping along with everyone else, knew exactly what they were talking about.\n\n\u201cBranched out a bit this year, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron, his eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cToo right it has,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThe Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts Houses and its own role in sorting them; Harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before.\n\n\u201cI wonder if it\u2019s ever given warnings before?\u201d said Hermione, sounding slightly anxious.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning across Neville toward her (Neville winced, it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you). \u201cThe hat feels itself honor-bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of first years\u2019 names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches. Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end. With a last frowning look that swept the four House tables, Professor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out,\n\n\u201cAbercrombie, Euan.\u201d\n\nThe terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled forward and put the hat on his head; it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears. The hat considered for a moment, then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted, \u201cGRYFFINDOR!\u201d\n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor House as Euan Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again.\n\nSlowly the long line of first years thinned; in the pauses between the names and the Sorting Hat\u2019s decisions, Harry could hear Ron\u2019s stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, \u201cZeller, Rose\u201d was sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and stool and marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet.\n\nHarry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before them all, whatever his recent bitter feelings toward his headmaster. Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song. But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their headmaster rising to greet them all before the start-of-term feast.\n\n\u201cTo our newcomers,\u201d said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, \u201cwelcome! To our old hands \u2014 welcome back! There is a time for speech making, but this is not it. Tuck in!\u201d\n\nThere was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his plate \u2014 for food had appeared out of nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables, bread, sauces, and flagons of pumpkin juice.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them onto his plate, watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick.\n\n\u201cWhat were you saying before the Sorting?\u201d Hermione asked the ghost. \u201cAbout the hat giving warnings?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm. \u201cYes, I have heard the hat give several warnings before, always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school. And always, of course, its advice is the same: Stand together, be strong from within.\u201d\n\n\u201cOw kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHis mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achievement for him to make any noise at all.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while Hermione looked revolted. Ron gave an enormous swallow and said, \u201cHow can it know if the school\u2019s in danger if it\u2019s a hat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick. \u201cOf course, it lives in Dumbledore\u2019s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it wants all the Houses to be friends?\u201d said Harry, looking over at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court. \u201cFat chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now, you shouldn\u2019t take that attitude,\u201d said Nick reprovingly. \u201cPeaceful cooperation, that\u2019s the key. We ghosts, though we belong to separate Houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly because you\u2019re terrified of him,\u201d said Ron.\n\nNearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted.\n\n\u201cTerrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never been guilty of cowardice in my life! The noble blood that runs in my veins \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat blood?\u201d asked Ron. \u201cSurely you haven\u2019t still got \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech!\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick, now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck. \u201cI assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like, even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me! But I am quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNick, he wasn\u2019t really laughing at you!\u201d said Hermione, throwing a furious look at Ron.\n\nUnfortunately, Ron\u2019s mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he could manage was \u201cnode iddum eentup sechew,\u201d which Nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology. Rising into the air, he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table, coming to rest between the Creevey brothers, Colin and Dennis.\n\n\u201cWell done, Ron,\u201d snapped Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow his food. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to ask a simple question?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh forget it,\u201d said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence.\n\nHarry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak-and-kidney pie, then a large plateful of his favorite treacle tart.\n\nWhen all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upward again, Dumbledore got to his feet once more. Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster. Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now. His four-poster bed was waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft. . . .\n\n\u201cWell, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cFirst years ought to know that the forest in the grounds is out of bounds to students \u2014 and a few of our older students ought to know by now too.\u201d (Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged smirks.)\n\n\u201cMr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four hundred and sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch\u2019s office door.\n\n\u201cWe have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.\u201d\n\nThere was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause during which Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged slightly panicked looks; Dumbledore had not said for how long Grubbly-Plank would be teaching.\n\nDumbledore continued, \u201cTryouts for the House Quidditch teams will take place on the \u2014\u201d\n\nHe broke off, looking inquiringly at Professor Umbridge. As she was not much taller standing than sitting, there was a moment when nobody understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking, but then Professor Umbridge said, \u201cHem, hem,\u201d and it became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech.\n\nDumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he sat back down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge as though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk. Other members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise. Professor Sprout\u2019s eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair, and Professor McGonagall\u2019s mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it. No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before. Many of the students were smirking; this woman obviously did not know how things were done at Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cThank you, Headmaster,\u201d Professor Umbridge simpered, \u201cfor those kind words of welcome.\u201d\n\nHer voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish and again, Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her, from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan. She gave another little throat-clearing cough (\u201cHem, hem\u201d) and continued: \u201cWell, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say!\u201d She smiled, revealing very pointed teeth. \u201cAnd to see such happy little faces looking back at me!\u201d\n\nHarry glanced around. None of the faces he could see looked happy; on the contrary, they all looked rather taken aback at being addressed as though they were five years old.\n\n\u201cI am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be very good friends!\u201d\n\nStudents exchanged looks at this; some of them were barely concealing grins.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be her friend as long as I don\u2019t have to borrow that cardigan,\u201d Parvati whispered to Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent giggles.\n\nProfessor Umbridge cleared her throat again (\u201cHem, hem\u201d), but when she continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice. She sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull learned-by-heart sound to them.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. The rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the Wizarding community must be passed down through the generations lest we lose them forever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished, and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members, none of whom bowed back. Professor McGonagall\u2019s dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little \u201cHem, hem\u201d and went on with her speech.\n\n\u201cEvery headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay. There again, progress for progress\u2019s sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation . . .\u201d\n\nHarry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune. The quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together, whispering and giggling. Over at the Ravenclaw table, Cho Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends. A few seats along from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out The Quibbler again. Meanwhile at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still staring at Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect\u2019s badge gleaming on his chest.\n\nProfessor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have plowed on with her speech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, though judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste.\n\n\u201c. . . because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment. Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness, and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited.\u201d\n\nShe sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead, though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping. A few students joined in, but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not having listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start applauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again.\n\n\u201cThank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illuminating,\u201d he said, bowing to her. \u201cNow \u2014 as I was saying, Quidditch tryouts will be held . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it certainly was illuminating,\u201d said Hermione in a low voice.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me you enjoyed it?\u201d Ron said quietly, turning a glazed face upon Hermione. \u201cThat was about the dullest speech I\u2019ve ever heard, and I grew up with Percy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said illuminating, not enjoyable,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt explained a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it?\u201d said Harry in surprise. \u201cSounded like a load of waffle to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,\u201d said Hermione grimly.\n\n\u201cWas there?\u201d said Ron blankly.\n\n\u201cHow about \u2018progress for progress\u2019s sake must be discouraged\u2019? How about \u2018pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what does that mean?\u201d said Ron impatiently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it means,\u201d said Hermione ominously. \u201cIt means the Ministry\u2019s interfering at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nThere was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was standing up ready to leave the Hall. Hermione jumped up, looking flustered.\n\n\u201cRon, we\u2019re supposed to show the first years where to go!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. \u201cHey \u2014 hey you lot! Midgets!\u201d\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they are, they\u2019re titchy . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, but you can\u2019t call them midgets. . . . First years!\u201d Hermione called commandingly along the table. \u201cThis way, please!\u201d\n\nA group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of them trying hard not to lead the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here. He grinned at them. A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified, nudged Euan, and whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt the grin slide off his face like Stinksap.\n\n\u201cSee you later,\u201d he said to Ron and Hermione and he made his way out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more whispering, staring, and pointing as he passed. He kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall, then he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed shortcuts, and had soon left most of the crowds behind.\n\nHe had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily, as he walked through much emptier upstairs corridors. Of course everyone was staring at him: He had emerged from the Triwizard maze two months ago clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen Lord Voldemort return to power. There had not been time last term to explain himself before everyone went home, even if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard.\n\nHe had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common room and had come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady before he realized that he did not know the new password.\n\n\u201cEr . . .\u201d he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him.\n\n\u201cNo password, no entrance,\u201d she said loftily.\n\n\u201cHarry, I know it!\u201d someone panted from behind him, and he turned to see Neville jogging toward him. \u201cGuess what it is? I\u2019m actually going to be able to remember it for once \u2014\u201d He waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train. \u201cMimbulus mimbletonia!\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open toward them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through which Harry and Neville now climbed.\n\nThe Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cozy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables. A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands before going up to their dormitories; on the other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning something up on the notice board. Harry waved good night to them and headed straight for the door to the boys\u2019 dormitories; he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment. Neville followed him.\n\nDean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs. They had been talking as Harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him. Harry wondered whether they had been talking about him, then whether he was being paranoid.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it.\n\n\u201cHey, Harry,\u201d said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in the West Ham colors. \u201cGood holiday?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bad,\u201d muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it was okay,\u201d chuckled Dean. \u201cBetter than Seamus\u2019s anyway, he was just telling me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, what happened, Seamus?\u201d Neville asked as he placed his Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet.\n\nSeamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team was quite straight. Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry, \u201cMe mam didn\u2019t want me to come back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t want me to come back to Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nSeamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pajamas out of his trunk, still not looking at Harry.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 why?\u201d said Harry, astonished. He knew that Seamus\u2019s mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she should have come over so Dursley-ish.\n\nSeamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pajamas.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said in a measured voice, \u201cI suppose . . . because of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Harry quickly. His heart was beating rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry\u2019s eyes, \u201cshe . . . er . . . well, it\u2019s not just you, it\u2019s Dumbledore too . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cShe believes the Daily Prophet?\u201d said Harry. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m a liar and Dumbledore\u2019s an old fool?\u201d\n\nSeamus looked up at him. \u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing. He threw his wand down onto his bedside table, pulled off his robes, stuffed them angrily into his trunk, and pulled on his pajamas. He was sick of it; sick of being the person who was stared at and talked about all the time. If any of them knew, if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to . . . Mrs. Finnigan had no idea, the stupid woman, he thought savagely.\n\nHe got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him, but before he could do so, Seamus said, \u201cLook . . . what did happen that night when . . . you know, when . . . with Cedric Diggory and all?\u201d\n\nSeamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who had been bending over his trunk, trying to retrieve a slipper, went oddly still and Harry knew he was listening hard.\n\n\u201cWhat are you asking me for?\u201d Harry retorted. \u201cJust read the Daily Prophet like your mother, why don\u2019t you? That\u2019ll tell you all you need to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a go at my mother,\u201d snapped Seamus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like that!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you how I want,\u201d said Harry, his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can be moved, stop your mummy worrying \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave my mother out of this, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nRon had appeared in the doorway. His wide eyes traveled from Harry, who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at Seamus, to Seamus, who was standing there with his fists raised.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s having a go at my mother!\u201d Seamus yelled.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron. \u201cHarry wouldn\u2019t do that \u2014 we met your mother, we liked her . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me!\u201d said Harry at the top of his voice.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face. \u201cOh . . . right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous look. \u201cHe\u2019s right, I don\u2019t want to share a dormitory with him anymore, he\u2019s a madman.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s out of order, Seamus,\u201d said Ron, whose ears were starting to glow red, always a danger sign.\n\n\u201cOut of order, am I?\u201d shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron was turning paler. \u201cYou believe all the rubbish he\u2019s come out with about You-Know-Who, do you, you reckon he\u2019s telling the truth?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I do!\u201d said Ron angrily.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re mad too,\u201d said Seamus in disgust.\n\n\u201cYeah? Well unfortunately for you, pal, I\u2019m also a prefect!\u201d said Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a finger. \u201cSo unless you want detention, watch your mouth!\u201d\n\nSeamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind; but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and Neville.\n\n\u201cAnyone else\u2019s parents got a problem with Harry?\u201d he said aggressively.\n\n\u201cMy parents are Muggles, mate,\u201d said Dean, shrugging. \u201cThey don\u2019t know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I\u2019m not stupid enough to tell them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know my mother, she\u2019ll weasel anything out of anyone!\u201d Seamus snapped at him. \u201cAnyway, your parents don\u2019t get the Daily Prophet, they don\u2019t know our headmaster\u2019s been sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he\u2019s losing his marbles \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy gran says that\u2019s rubbish,\u201d piped up Neville. \u201cShe says it\u2019s the Daily Prophet that\u2019s going downhill, not Dumbledore. She\u2019s canceled our subscription. We believe Harry,\u201d he said simply. He climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them at Seamus. \u201cMy gran\u2019s always said You-Know-Who would come back one day. She says if Dumbledore says he\u2019s back, he\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nHarry felt a rush of gratitude toward Neville. Nobody else said anything. Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings, and vanished behind them. Dean got into bed, rolled over, and fell silent. Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus.\n\nHarry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next bed, putting his things away. He felt shaken by the argument with Seamus, whom he had always liked very much. How many more people were going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged?\n\nHad Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown him from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months? The two of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider Wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was a liar had to think that Dumbledore was too or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked. . . .\n\nThey\u2019ll know we\u2019re right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory. But he wondered how many attacks like Seamus\u2019s he would have to endure before that time came."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter12": "PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE\n\n\n\n\nSeamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before Harry had even put on his socks.\n\n\u201cDoes he think he\u2019ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long?\u201d asked Harry loudly, as the hem of Seamus\u2019s robes whipped out of sight.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Harry,\u201d Dean muttered, hoisting his schoolbag onto his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s just . . .\u201d But apparently he was unable to say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room.\n\nNeville and Ron both gave Harry it\u2019s-his-problem-not-yours looks, but Harry was not much consoled. How much more of this was he going to have to take?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Hermione five minutes later, catching up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all headed toward breakfast. \u201cYou look absolutely \u2014 oh for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nShe was staring at the common room notice board, where a large new sign had been put up.\n\n\n\n\n\nGALLONS OF GALLEONS!\n\n\nPocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings?\n\nLike to earn a little extra gold?\n\n\n\nContact Fred and George Weasley, Gryffindor common room, for simple, part-time, virtually painless jobs\n\n(WE REGRET THAT ALL WORK IS UNDERTAKEN AT APPLICANT\u2019S OWN RISK)\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are the limit,\u201d said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign, which Fred and George had pinned up over a poster giving the date of the first Hogsmeade weekend in October. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to talk to them, Ron.\u201d\n\nRon looked positively alarmed.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re prefects!\u201d said Hermione, as they climbed out through the portrait hole. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to stop this kind of thing!\u201d\n\nRon said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they liked was not one that he found inviting.\n\n\u201cAnyway, what\u2019s up, Harry?\u201d Hermione continued, as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards, all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation. \u201cYou look really angry about something.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeamus reckons Harry\u2019s lying about You-Know-Who,\u201d said Ron succinctly, when Harry did not respond.\n\nHermione, whom Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf, sighed.\n\n\u201cYes, Lavender thinks so too,\u201d she said gloomily.\n\n\u201cBeen having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I\u2019m a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?\u201d Harry said loudly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione calmly, \u201cI told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down Ron\u2019s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019re on your side.\u201d\n\nThere was a short pause.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry in a low voice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what Dumbledore said at the end-of-term feast last year?\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron both looked at her blankly, and Hermione sighed again.\n\n\u201cAbout You-Know-Who. He said, \u2018His gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you remember stuff like that?\u201d asked Ron, looking at her in admiration.\n\n\u201cI listen, Ron,\u201d said Hermione with a touch of asperity.\n\n\u201cSo do I, but I still couldn\u2019t tell you exactly what \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point,\u201d Hermione pressed on loudly, \u201cis that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who\u2019s only been back two months, and we\u2019ve started fighting among ourselves. And the Sorting Hat\u2019s warning was the same \u2014 stand together, be united \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Harry said it last night,\u201d retorted Ron, \u201cif that means we\u2019re supposed to get matey with the Slytherins, fat chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s a pity we\u2019re not trying for a bit of inter-House unity,\u201d said Hermione crossly.\n\nThey had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourth-year Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight of Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he might attack stragglers.\n\n\u201cYeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that,\u201d said Harry sarcastically.\n\nThey followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered. Professor Grubbly-Plank was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence. The enchanted ceiling above them echoed Harry\u2019s mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud gray.\n\n\u201cDumbledore didn\u2019t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman\u2019s staying,\u201d he said, as they made their way across to the Gryffindor table.\n\n\u201cMaybe . . .\u201d said Hermione thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said both Harry and Ron together.\n\n\u201cWell . . . maybe he didn\u2019t want to draw attention to Hagrid not being here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, draw attention to it?\u201d said Ron, half laughing. \u201cHow could we not notice?\u201d\n\nBefore Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long, braided hair had marched up to Harry.\n\n\u201cHi, Angelina.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said briskly, \u201cgood summer?\u201d And without waiting for an answer, \u201cListen, I\u2019ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice one,\u201d said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina\u2019s pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood\u2019s had been, which could only be an improvement.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver\u2019s left. Tryouts are on Friday at five o\u2019clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then we can see how the new person\u2019ll fit in.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, and she smiled at him and departed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten Wood had left,\u201d said Hermione vaguely, sitting down beside Ron and pulling a plate of toast toward her. \u201cI suppose that will make quite a difference to the team?\u201d\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose,\u201d said Harry, taking the bench opposite. \u201cHe was a good Keeper . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cStill, it won\u2019t hurt to have some new blood, will it?\u201d said Ron.\n\nWith a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows. They descended all over the Hall, bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only correspondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new to tell him after only twenty-four hours apart. Hermione, however, had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak.\n\n\u201cWhat are you still getting that for?\u201d said Harry irritably, thinking of Seamus, as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the owl\u2019s leg and it took off again. \u201cI\u2019m not bothering . . . load of rubbish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best to know what the enemy are saying,\u201d said Hermione darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it, not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate. \u201cNothing about you or Dumbledore or anything.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out schedules.\n\n\u201cLook at today!\u201d groaned Ron. \u201cHistory of Magic, double Potions, Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns, Snape, Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred and George\u2019d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDo mine ears deceive me?\u201d said Fred, arriving with George and squeezing onto the bench beside Harry. \u201cHogwarts prefects surely don\u2019t wish to skive off lessons?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook what we\u2019ve got today,\u201d said Ron grumpily, shoving his schedule under Fred\u2019s nose. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst Monday I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair point, little bro,\u201d said Fred, scanning the column. \u201cYou can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s it cheap?\u201d said Ron suspiciously.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven\u2019t got an antidote yet,\u201d said George, helping himself to a kipper.\n\n\u201cCheers,\u201d said Ron moodily, pocketing his schedule, \u201cbut I think I\u2019ll take the lessons.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,\u201d said Hermione, eyeing Fred and George beadily, \u201cyou can\u2019t advertise for testers on the Gryffindor notice board.\u201d\n\n\u201cSays who?\u201d said George, looking astonished.\n\n\u201cSays me,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cAnd Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave me out of it,\u201d said Ron hastily.\n\nHermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,\u201d said Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. \u201cYou\u2019re starting your fifth year, you\u2019ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cFifth year\u2019s O.W.L. year,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve got your exams coming up, haven\u2019t you? They\u2019ll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they\u2019ll be rubbed raw,\u201d said Fred with satisfaction.\n\n\u201cHalf our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s,\u201d said George happily. \u201cTears and tantrums . . . Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cKenneth Towler came out in boils, d\u2019you remember?\u201d said Fred reminiscently.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Fred, grinning. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten. . . . Hard to keep track sometimes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s a nightmare of a year, the fifth,\u201d said George. \u201cIf you care about exam results anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our spirits up somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . you got, what was it, three O.W.L.s each?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Fred unconcernedly. \u201cBut we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year,\u201d said George brightly, \u201cnow that we\u2019ve got \u2014\u201d\n\nHe broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them.\n\n\u201c\u2014 now that we\u2019ve got our O.W.L.s,\u201d George said hastily. \u201cI mean, do we really need N.E.W.T.s? But we didn\u2019t think Mum could take us leaving school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the world\u2019s biggest prat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to waste our last year here, though,\u201d said Fred, looking affectionately around at the Great Hall. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use it to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from his joke shop, carefully evaluate the results of our research, and then produce the products to fit the demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?\u201d asked Hermione skeptically. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need all the ingredients and materials \u2014 and premises too, I suppose . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say overhead, \u201cAsk us no questions and we\u2019ll tell you no lies, Hermione. C\u2019mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology.\u201d\n\nHarry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast.\n\n\u201cWhat did that mean?\u201d said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron. \u201c\u2018Ask us no questions . . . \u2019 Does that mean they\u2019ve already got some gold to start a joke shop?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been wondering about that,\u201d said Ron, his brow furrowed. \u201cThey bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and I couldn\u2019t understand where they got the Galleons . . .\u201d\n\nHarry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you reckon it\u2019s true this year\u2019s going to be really tough? Because of the exams?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBound to be, isn\u2019t it? O.W.L.s are really important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get career advice too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?\u201d Harry asked the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterward and set off toward their History of Magic classroom.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Ron slowly. \u201cExcept . . . well . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked slightly sheepish.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry urged him.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019d be cool to be an Auror,\u201d said Ron in an offhand voice.\n\n\u201cYeah, it would,\u201d said Harry fervently.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re, like, the elite,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be really good. What about you, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI think I\u2019d really like to do something worthwhile.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Auror\u2019s worthwhile!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, it is, but it\u2019s not the only worthwhile thing,\u201d said Hermione thoughtfully. \u201cI mean, if I could take S.P.E.W. further . . .\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other.\n\nHistory of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by Wizard-kind. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. He never varied the form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while they took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying Hermione\u2019s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns\u2019s voice.\n\nToday they suffered three-quarters of an hour\u2019s droning on the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher\u2019s hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.\n\n\u201cHow would it be,\u201d she asked them coldly as they left the classroom for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), \u201cif I refused to lend you my notes this year?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d fail our O.W.L.s,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIf you want that on your conscience, Hermione . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019d deserve it,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t even try to listen to him, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do try,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got your brains or your memory or your concentration \u2014 you\u2019re just cleverer than we are \u2014 is it nice to rub it in?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t give me that rubbish,\u201d said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard.\n\nA fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles around the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony, turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year. They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner toward them.\n\n\u201cHello, Harry!\u201d\n\nIt was Cho Chang and what was more, she was on her own again. This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the Yule Ball.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least you\u2019re not covered in Stinksap this time, he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines.\n\n\u201cYou got that stuff off, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. \u201cSo did you . . . er . . . have a good summer?\u201d\n\nThe moment he had said this he wished he hadn\u2019t: Cedric had been Cho\u2019s boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry\u2019s. . . . Something seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, \u201cOh, it was all right, you know . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a Tornados badge?\u201d Ron demanded suddenly, pointing at the front of Cho\u2019s robes, to which a sky-blue badge emblazoned with a double gold T was pinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t support them, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d said Cho.\n\n\u201cHave you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league?\u201d said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve supported them since I was six,\u201d said Cho coolly. \u201cAnyway . . . see you, Harry.\u201d\n\nShe walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on Ron.\n\n\u201cYou are so tactless!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? I only asked her if \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo? She could\u2019ve done, I wasn\u2019t stopping \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team for?\u201d\n\n\u201cAttacking? I wasn\u2019t attacking her, I was only \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho cares if she supports the Tornados?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does it matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means they\u2019re not real fans, they\u2019re just jumping on the bandwagon \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bell,\u201d said Harry listlessly, because Ron and Hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the way down to Snape\u2019s dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes\u2019 conversation with Cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country.\n\nAnd yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside Snape\u2019s classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn\u2019t she? She had been Cedric\u2019s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for Cedric\u2019s death. . . . Yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him, and that made the second time in two days . . . and at this thought, Harry\u2019s spirits rose. Even the ominous sound of Snape\u2019s dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest. He filed into the classroom behind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.\n\n\u201cSettle down,\u201d said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him.\n\nThere was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class had heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped. Snape\u2019s mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class\u2019s silence.\n\n\u201cBefore we begin today\u2019s lesson,\u201d said Snape, sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all, \u201cI think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions. Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an \u2018Acceptable\u2019 in your O.W.L., or suffer my . . . displeasure.\u201d\n\nHis gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped.\n\n\u201cAfter this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,\u201d Snape went on. \u201cI take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying good-bye.\u201d\n\nHis eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions after fifth year.\n\n\u201cBut we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell,\u201d said Snape softly, \u201cso whether you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my O.W.L. students.\n\n\u201cToday we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing.\u201d On Harry\u2019s left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expression one of the utmost attentiveness. \u201cThe ingredients and method\u201d \u2014 Snape flicked his wand \u2014 \u201care on the blackboard\u201d \u2014 (they appeared there) \u2014 \u201cyou will find everything you need\u201d \u2014 he flicked his wand again \u2014 \u201cin the store cupboard\u201d \u2014 (the door of the said cupboard sprang open) \u2014 \u201cyou have an hour and a half. . . . Start.\u201d\n\nJust as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had predicted, Snape could hardly have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times, firstly in clockwise, then in counterclockwise directions; the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added.\n\n\u201cA light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,\u201d called Snape, with ten minutes left to go.\n\nHarry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the dungeon. His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray steam; Ron\u2019s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as they had gone out. The surface of Hermione\u2019s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that he could find nothing to criticize. At Harry\u2019s cauldron, however, Snape stopped, looking down at Harry with a horrible smirk on his face.\n\n\u201cPotter, what is this supposed to be?\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they loved hearing Snape taunt Harry.\n\n\u201cThe Draught of Peace,\u201d said Harry tensely.\n\n\u201cTell me, Potter,\u201d said Snape softly, \u201ccan you read?\u201d\n\nDraco Malfoy laughed.\n\n\u201cYes, I can,\u201d said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his wand.\n\n\u201cRead the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.\u201d\n\nHarry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of multicolored steam now filling the dungeon.\n\n\u201c\u2018Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of hellebore.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minutes.\n\n\u201cDid you do everything on the third line, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry very quietly.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, more loudly. \u201cI forgot the hellebore . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless. Evanesco.\u201d\n\nThe contents of Harry\u2019s potion vanished; he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron.\n\n\u201cThose of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name, and bring it up to my desk for testing,\u201d said Snape. \u201cHomework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away his things, seething. His potion had been no worse than Ron\u2019s, which was now giving off a foul odor of bad eggs, or Neville\u2019s, which had achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron, yet it was he, Harry, who would be receiving zero marks for the day\u2019s work. He stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down onto his seat, watching everyone else march up to Snape\u2019s desk with filled and corked flagons. When at long last the bell rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time Ron and Hermione joined him in the Great Hall. The ceiling had turned an even murkier gray during the morning. Rain was lashing the high windows.\n\n\u201cThat was really unfair,\u201d said Hermione consolingly, sitting down next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd\u2019s pie. \u201cYour potion wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as Goyle\u2019s, when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d said Harry, glowering at his plate, \u201csince when has Snape ever been fair to me?\u201d\n\nNeither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape and Harry\u2019s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment Harry had set foot in Hogwarts.\n\n\u201cI did think he might be a bit better this year,\u201d said Hermione in a disappointed voice. \u201cI mean . . . you know . . .\u201d She looked carefully around; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table. \u201c. . . Now he\u2019s in the Order and everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoisonous toadstools don\u2019t change their spots,\u201d said Ron sagely. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting Snape, where\u2019s the evidence he ever really stopped working for You-Know-Who?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Dumbledore\u2019s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he doesn\u2019t share it with you, Ron,\u201d snapped Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh, shut up, the pair of you,\u201d said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. \u201cCan\u2019t you give it a rest?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re always having a go at each other, it\u2019s driving me mad.\u201d And abandoning his shepherd\u2019s pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there.\n\nHe walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many students hurrying toward lunch. The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione\u2019s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction. Serve them right, he thought. Why can\u2019t they give it a rest? . . . Bickering all the time . . . It\u2019s enough to drive anyone up the wall. . . .\n\nHe passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing; Sir Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who ignored him.\n\n\u201cCome back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!\u201d yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked on, and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighboring picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and angry-looking wolfhound.\n\nHarry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of North Tower, and consequently he was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sybill Trelawney\u2019s classroom when the bell rang.\n\nDivination was Harry\u2019s least favorite class after Potions, which was due mainly to Professor Trelawney\u2019s habit of predicting his premature death every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some kind of insect, with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was busy putting copies of battered, leather-bound books on each of the spindly little tables with which her room was littered when Harry entered the room, but so dim was the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire that she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows. The rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes. Ron emerged from the trapdoor, looked around carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for him, or as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables, chairs, and overstuffed poufs.\n\n\u201cHermione and me have stopped arguing,\u201d he said, sitting down beside Harry.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d grunted Harry.\n\n\u201cBut Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just passing on the message,\u201d said Ron, talking over him. \u201cBut I reckon she\u2019s right. It\u2019s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGood day,\u201d said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy voice, and Harry broke off, feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself again. \u201cAnd welcome back to Divination. I have, of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely \u2014 as, of course, I knew you would.\n\n\u201cYou will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle, by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your O.W.L. Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination. If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very little. However, the headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so . . .\u201d\n\nHer voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as examinations.\n\n\u201cTurn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation. Then divide into pairs. Use The Dream Oracle to interpret each other\u2019s most recent dreams. Carry on.\u201d\n\nThe one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double period. By the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation. At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with Neville, who immediately embarked on a long-winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother\u2019s best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.\n\n\u201cI never remember my dreams,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou say one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must remember one of them,\u201d said Harry impatiently.\n\nHe was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did not need Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to tell him that. . . .\n\n\u201cWell, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night,\u201d said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. \u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon that means?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably that you\u2019re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something,\u201d said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without interest.\n\nIt was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell went, he and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling loudly.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you realize how much homework we\u2019ve got already? Binns set us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones, and now we\u2019ve got a month\u2019s dream diary from Trelawney! Fred and George weren\u2019t wrong about O.W.L. year, were they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any . . .\u201d\n\nWhen they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher\u2019s desk, wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad.\n\nThe class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be.\n\n\u201cWell, good afternoon!\u201d she said when finally the whole class had sat down.\n\nA few people mumbled \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d in reply.\n\n\u201cTut, tut,\u201d said Professor Umbridge. \u201cThat won\u2019t do, now, will it? I should like you, please, to reply \u2018Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge.\u2019 One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Professor Umbridge,\u201d they chanted back at her.\n\n\u201cThere, now,\u201d said Professor Umbridge sweetly. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t too difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.\u201d\n\nMany of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order \u201cwands away\u201d had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting. Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled out quill, ink, and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:\n\nDefense Against the Dark Arts\n\nA Return to Basic Principles\n\n\n\n\u201cWell now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. \u201cThe constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year.\n\n\u201cYou will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please.\u201d\n\nShe rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and was replaced by:\n\n\n\nCourse aims:\n\n1. Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic.\n\n2. Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic can legally be used.\n\n3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use.\n\n\n\nFor a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor Umbridge\u2019s three course aims she said, \u201cHas everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?\u201d\n\nThere was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll try that again,\u201d said Professor Umbridge. \u201cWhen I ask you a question, I should like you to reply \u2018Yes, Professor Umbridge,\u2019 or \u2018No, Professor Umbridge.\u2019 So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Professor Umbridge,\u201d rang through the room.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Professor Umbridge. \u201cI should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one, \u2018Basics for Beginners.\u2019 There will be no need to talk.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher\u2019s desk, observing them all with those pouchy toad\u2019s eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and started to read.\n\nIt was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absentmindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy of Defensive Magical Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the air.\n\nHarry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose. He looked at her questioningly, but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who was looking just as resolutely in another direction.\n\nAfter several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch Hermione\u2019s mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge\u2019s eye than to struggle on with \u201cBasics for Beginners.\u201d\n\nWhen more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer.\n\n\u201cDid you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?\u201d she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.\n\n\u201cNot about the chapter, no,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re reading just now,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, showing her small, pointed teeth. \u201cIf you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a query about your course aims,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nProfessor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.\n\n\u201cAnd your name is \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione Granger,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully,\u201d said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione bluntly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing written up there about using defensive spells.\u201d\n\nThere was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard.\n\n\u201cUsing defensive spells?\u201d Professor Umbridge repeated with a little laugh. \u201cWhy, I can\u2019t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren\u2019t expecting to be attacked during class?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to use magic?\u201d Ron ejaculated loudly.\n\n\u201cStudents raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr. \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWeasley,\u201d said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.\n\nProfessor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on him. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor Umbridge\u2019s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before she addressed Hermione.\n\n\u201cYes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cSurely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?\u201d asked Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.\n\n\u201cNo, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, I\u2019m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the \u2018whole point\u2019 of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new program of study. You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat use is that?\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be attacked it won\u2019t be in a \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHand, Mr. Potter!\u201d sang Professor Umbridge.\n\nHarry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly turned away from him again, but now several other people had their hands up too.\n\n\u201cAnd your name is?\u201d Professor Umbridge said to Dean.\n\n\u201cDean Thomas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Mr. Thomas?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s like Harry said, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Dean. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be attacked, it won\u2019t be risk-free \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI repeat,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Dean, \u201cdo you expect to be attacked during my classes?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge talked over him.\n\n\u201cI do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school,\u201d she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, \u201cbut you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed \u2014 not to mention,\u201d she gave a nasty little laugh, \u201cextremely dangerous half-breeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you mean Professor Lupin,\u201d piped up Dean Thomas angrily, \u201che was the best we ever \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying \u2014 you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo we haven\u2019t,\u201d Hermione said, \u201cwe just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour hand is not up, Miss Granger!\u201d\n\nHermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from her.\n\n\u201cIt is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he turned out to be a maniac, didn\u2019t he?\u201d said Dean Thomas hotly. \u201cMind you, we still learned loads \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!\u201d trilled Professor Umbridge. \u201cNow, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?\u201d she added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.\n\n\u201cParvati Patil, and isn\u2019t there a practical bit in our Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.? Aren\u2019t we supposed to show that we can actually do the countercurses and things?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,\u201d said Professor Umbridge dismissively.\n\n\u201cWithout ever practicing them before?\u201d said Parvati incredulously. \u201cAre you telling us that the first time we\u2019ll get to do the spells will be during our exam?\u201d\n\n\u201cI repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what good\u2019s theory going to be in the real world?\u201d said Harry loudly, his fist in the air again.\n\nProfessor Umbridge looked up.\n\n\u201cThis is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,\u201d she said softly.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re not supposed to be prepared for what\u2019s waiting out there?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d said Harry. His temper, which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point.\n\n\u201cWho do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?\u201d inquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice.\n\n\u201cHmm, let\u2019s think . . .\u201d said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice, \u201cmaybe Lord Voldemort?\u201d\n\nRon gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville slipped sideways off his stool. Professor Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face.\n\n\u201cTen points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.\u201d\n\nThe classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry.\n\n\u201cNow, let me make a few things quite plain.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward them, her stubby-fingered hands splayed on her desk.\n\n\u201cYou have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t dead,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cbut yeah, he\u2019s returned!\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,\u201d said Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at him. \u201cAs I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is NOT a lie!\u201d said Harry. \u201cI saw him, I fought him!\u201d\n\n\u201cDetention, Mr. Potter!\u201d said Professor Umbridge triumphantly. \u201cTomorrow evening. Five o\u2019clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page five, \u2018Basics for Beginners.\u2019\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. Harry, however, stood up. Everyone was staring at him; Seamus looked half-scared, half-fascinated.\n\n\u201cHarry, no!\u201d Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach.\n\n\u201cSo, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he?\u201d Harry asked, his voice shaking.\n\nThere was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk about what had happened on the night that Cedric had died. They stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face.\n\n\u201cCedric Diggory\u2019s death was a tragic accident,\u201d she said coldly.\n\n\u201cIt was murder,\u201d said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had hardly talked to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates. \u201cVoldemort killed him, and you know it.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge\u2019s face was quite blank. For a moment he thought she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest, most sweetly girlish voice, \u201cCome here, Mr. Potter, dear.\u201d\n\nHe kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and up to the teacher\u2019s desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its breath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next.\n\nProfessor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could not see what she was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it.\n\n\u201cTake this to Professor McGonagall, dear,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him.\n\nHe took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not even looking back at Ron and Hermione, and slamming the classroom door shut behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor, the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a corner walked slap into Peeves the Poltergeist, a wide-faced little man floating on his back in midair, juggling several inkwells.\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s Potty Wee Potter!\u201d cackled Peeves, allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink; Harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl.\n\n\u201cGet out of it, Peeves.\u201d\n\n\u201cOooh, Crackpot\u2019s feeling cranky,\u201d said Peeves, pursuing Harry along the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him. \u201cWhat is it this time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? Speaking in\u201d \u2014 Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry \u2014 \u201ctongues?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, leave me ALONE!\u201d Harry shouted, running down the nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, most think he\u2019s barking, the Potty wee lad,\n\nBut some are more kindly and think he\u2019s just sad,\n\nBut Peevesy knows better and says that he\u2019s mad \u2014\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d\n\nA door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed.\n\n\u201cWhat on earth are you shouting about, Potter?\u201d she snapped, as Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in class?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sent to see you,\u201d said Harry stiffly.\n\n\u201cSent? What do you mean, sent?\u201d\n\nHe held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGonagall took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand, stretched it out, and began to read. Her eyes zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written, and with each line they became narrower.\n\n\u201cCome in here, Potter.\u201d\n\nHe followed her inside her study. The door closed automatically behind him.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. \u201cIs this true?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs what true?\u201d Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had intended. \u201cProfessor?\u201d he added in an attempt to sound more polite.\n\n\u201cIs it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou called her a liar?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, frowning at Harry. Then she said, \u201cHave a biscuit, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave \u2014 what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave a biscuit,\u201d she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin of cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. \u201cAnd sit down.\u201d\n\nThere had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be caned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrong-footed as he had done on that occasion.\n\nProfessor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge\u2019s note and looked very seriously at Harry.\n\n\u201cPotter, you need to be careful.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her. Her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk, crisp, and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual.\n\n\u201cMisbehavior in Dolores Umbridge\u2019s class could cost you much more than House points and a detention.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cPotter, use your common sense,\u201d snapped Professor McGonagall, with an abrupt return to her usual manner. \u201cYou know where she comes from, you must know to whom she is reporting.\u201d\n\nThe bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move.\n\n\u201cIt says here she\u2019s given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow,\u201d Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridge\u2019s note again.\n\n\u201cEvery evening this week!\u201d Harry repeated, horrified. \u201cBut, Professor, couldn\u2019t you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Professor McGonagall flatly.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You will go to her room at five o\u2019clock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I was telling the truth!\u201d said Harry, outraged. \u201cVoldemort\u2019s back, you know he is, Professor Dumbledore knows he is \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Potter!\u201d said Professor McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort\u2019s name). \u201cDo you really think this is about truth or lies? It\u2019s about keeping your head down and your temper under control!\u201d\n\nShe stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and he stood too.\n\n\u201cHave another biscuit,\u201d she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him.\n\n\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d said Harry coldly.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she snapped.\n\nHe took one.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said grudgingly.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you listen to Dolores Umbridge\u2019s speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYeah . . . she said . . . progress will be prohibited or . . . well, it meant that . . . that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then sniffed, walked around her desk, and held open the door for him.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,\u201d she said, pointing him out of her office."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter13": "DETENTION WITH DOLORES\n\n\n\n\nDinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry. The news about his shouting match with Umbridge seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards. He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him \u2014 on the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his story firsthand.\n\n\u201cHe says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe reckons he dueled with You-Know-Who . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome off it . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWho does he think he\u2019s kidding?\u201d\n\n\u201cPur-lease . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t get,\u201d said Harry in a shaking voice, laying down his knife and fork (his hands were trembling too much to hold them steady), \u201cis why they all believed the story two months ago when Dumbledore told them . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing is, Harry, I\u2019m not sure they did,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cOh, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\n\nShe slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron looked sadly at his half-finished apple pie but followed suit. People stared at them all the way out of the Hall.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, you\u2019re not sure they believed Dumbledore?\u201d Harry asked Hermione when they reached the first-floor landing.\n\n\u201cLook, you don\u2019t understand what it was like after it happened,\u201d said Hermione quietly. \u201cYou arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric\u2019s dead body. . . . None of us saw what happened in the maze. . . . We just had Dumbledore\u2019s word for it that You-Know-Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is the truth!\u201d said Harry loudly.\n\n\u201cI know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my head off?\u201d said Hermione wearily. \u201cIt\u2019s just that before the truth could sink in, everyone went home for the summer, where they spent two months reading about how you\u2019re a nutcase and Dumbledore\u2019s going senile!\u201d\n\nRain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week, but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed. A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye. He glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned into the Fat Lady\u2019s corridor. There was still no light in Hagrid\u2019s cabin.\n\n\u201cMimbulus mimbletonia,\u201d said Hermione, before the Fat Lady could ask. The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind and the three of them scrambled back through it.\n\nThe common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly into Hermione\u2019s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion. Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted.\n\n\u201cHow can Dumbledore have let this happen?\u201d Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted. She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits of stuffing leaked out of the holes. \u201cHow can he let that terrible woman teach us? And in our O.W.L. year too!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, have we?\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like, Hagrid told us, nobody wants the job, they say it\u2019s jinxed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but to employ someone who\u2019s actually refusing to let us do magic! What\u2019s Dumbledore playing at?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s trying to get people to spy for her,\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cRemember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying You-Know-Who\u2019s back?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course she\u2019s here to spy on us all, that\u2019s obvious, why else would Fudge have wanted her to come?\u201d snapped Hermione.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t start arguing again,\u201d said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his mouth to retaliate. \u201cCan\u2019t we just . . . Let\u2019s just do that homework, get it out of the way . . .\u201d\n\nThey collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the chairs by the fire. People were coming back from dinner now. Harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the stares he was attracting.\n\n\u201cShall we do Snape\u2019s stuff first?\u201d said Ron, dipping his quill into his ink. \u201c\u2018The properties . . . of moonstone . . . and its uses . . . in potion-making . . .\u2019\u201d he muttered, writing the words across the top of his parchment as he spoke them. \u201cThere.\u201d He underlined the title, then looked up expectantly at Hermione.\n\n\u201cSo what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making?\u201d\n\nBut Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far corner of the room, where Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, they\u2019ve gone too far,\u201d she said, standing up and looking positively furious. \u201cCome on, Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 what?\u201d said Ron, plainly playing for time. \u201cNo \u2014 come on, Hermione \u2014 we can\u2019t tell them off for giving out sweets . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or \u2014 or Puking Pastilles or \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFainting Fancies?\u201d Harry suggested quietly.\n\nOne by one, as though hit over the heads with invisible mallets, the first years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right onto the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their tongues lolling out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Hermione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first years. Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, \u201cShe\u2019s got it under control,\u201d before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Hermione said forcefully to Fred and George, both of whom looked up in mild surprise.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d said George, nodding, \u201cthis dosage looks strong enough, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you this morning, you can\u2019t test your rubbish on students!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re paying them!\u201d said Fred indignantly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, it could be dangerous!\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cCalm down, Hermione, they\u2019re fine!\u201d said Lee reassuringly as he walked from first year to first year, inserting purple sweets into their open mouths.\n\n\u201cYeah, look, they\u2019re coming round now,\u201d said George.\n\nA few of the first years were indeed stirring. Several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor, or dangling off their chairs, that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned them what the sweets were going to do.\n\n\u201cFeel all right?\u201d said George kindly to a small dark-haired girl lying at his feet.\n\n\u201cI-I think so,\u201d she said shakily.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies from his hands.\n\n\u201cIt is NOT excellent!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course it is, they\u2019re alive, aren\u2019t they?\u201d said Fred angrily.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this, what if you made one of them really ill?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make them ill, we\u2019ve already tested them all on ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop doing it, I\u2019m going to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPut us in detention?\u201d said Fred in an I\u2019d-like-to-see-you-try-it voice.\n\n\u201cMake us write lines?\u201d said George, smirking.\n\nOnlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew herself up to her full height; her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her voice quivering with anger, \u201cbut I will write to your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said George, horrified, taking a step back from her.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, I would,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cI can\u2019t stop you eating the stupid things yourselves, but you\u2019re not giving them to first years.\u201d\n\nFred and George looked thunderstruck. It was clear that as far as they were concerned, Hermione\u2019s threat was way below the belt. With a last threatening look at them, she thrust Fred\u2019s clipboard and the bag of Fancies back into his arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire.\n\nRon was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with his knees.\n\n\u201cThank you for your support, Ron,\u201d Hermione said acidly.\n\n\u201cYou handled it fine by yourself,\u201d Ron mumbled.\n\nHermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few seconds, then said edgily, \u201cOh, it\u2019s no good, I can\u2019t concentrate now. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d\n\nShe wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill, and stood back to admire the effect.\n\n\u201cWhat in the name of Merlin are you doing?\u201d said Ron, watching her as though fearful for her sanity.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hats for house-elves,\u201d she said briskly, now stuffing her books back into her bag. \u201cI did them over the summer. I\u2019m a really slow knitter without magic, but now I\u2019m back at school I should be able to make lots more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re leaving out hats for the house-elves?\u201d said Ron slowly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re covering them up with rubbish first?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag onto her back.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not on,\u201d said Ron angrily. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to trick them into picking up the hats. You\u2019re setting them free when they might not want to be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they want to be free!\u201d said Hermione at once, though her face was turning pink. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch those hats, Ron!\u201d\n\nShe left. Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girls\u2019 dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats.\n\n\u201cThey should at least see what they\u2019re picking up,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cAnyway . . .\u201d He rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of Snape\u2019s essay. \u201cThere\u2019s no point trying to finish this now, I can\u2019t do it without Hermione, I haven\u2019t got a clue what you\u2019re supposed to do with moonstones, have you?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his right temple was getting worse. He thought of the long essay on giant wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that he would regret not finishing his homework tonight when the morning came, he piled his books back into his bag.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed too.\u201d\n\nHe passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but did not look at him. Harry had a fleeting impression that Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation.\n\n\nThe following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous one. Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast.\n\n\u201cBut on the plus side, no Snape today,\u201d said Ron bracingly.\n\nHermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. She looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her what she had to be so happy about, she simply said, \u201cThe hats have gone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on it,\u201d Ron told her cuttingly. \u201cThey might not count as clothes. They didn\u2019t look anything like hats to me, more like woolly bladders.\u201d\n\nHermione did not speak to him all morning.\n\nDouble Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of O.W.L.s.\n\n\u201cWhat you must remember,\u201d said little Professor Flitwick squeakily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top of his desk, \u201cis that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come! If you have not already given serious thought to your careers, now is the time to do so. And in the meantime, I\u2019m afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice!\u201d\n\nThey then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms, which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their O.W.L., and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest amount of Charms homework ever.\n\nIt was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.\n\n\u201cYou cannot pass an O.W.L.,\u201d said Professor McGonagall grimly, \u201cwithout serious application, practice, and study. I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work.\u201d Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. \u201cYes, you too, Longbottom,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So . . . today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L.\u201d\n\nShe was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed to vanish the snails on which they were practicing, though Ron said hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall. She was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told to practice the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails the following afternoon.\n\nNow panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the uses of moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron\u2019s slur on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them. By the time they reached Care of Magical Creatures in the afternoon, Harry\u2019s head was aching again.\n\nThe day had become cool and breezy, and, as they walked down the sloping lawn toward Hagrid\u2019s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces. Professor Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrid\u2019s front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with many twigs. As Harry and Ron reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding toward them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin cronies. He had clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table. Judging by the fact that all of them kept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty.\n\n\u201cEveryone here?\u201d barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. \u201cLet\u2019s crack on then \u2014 who can tell me what these things are called?\u201d\n\nShe indicated the heap of twigs in front of her. Hermione\u2019s hand shot into the air. Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question. Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand, and a funny, flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered.\n\n\u201cOooooh!\u201d said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry: Anyone would have thought that Hagrid never showed them impressive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.\n\n\u201cKindly keep your voices down, girls!\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food. \u201cSo \u2014 anyone know the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?\u201d\n\n\u201cBowtruckles,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThey\u2019re tree-guardians, usually live in wand-trees.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive points for Gryffindor,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \u201cYes, these are bowtruckles and, as Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what they eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWood lice,\u201d said Hermione promptly, which explained why what Harry had taken for grains of brown rice were moving. \u201cBut fairy eggs if they can get them.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood girl, take another five points. So whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of wood lice ready to distract or placate it. They may not look dangerous, but if angered they will gouge out human eyes with their fingers, which, as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs. So if you\u2019d like to gather closer, take a few wood lice and a bowtruckle \u2014 I have enough here for one between three \u2014 you can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all body parts labeled by the end of the lesson.\u201d\n\nThe class surged forward around the trestle table. Harry deliberately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor Grubbly-Plank.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Hagrid?\u201d he asked her, while everyone else was choosing bowtruckles.\n\n\u201cNever you mind,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively, which had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too. Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned across Harry and seized the largest bowtruckle.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could hear him, \u201cthe stupid great oaf\u2019s got himself badly injured.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you will if you don\u2019t shut up,\u201d said Harry out of the side of his mouth.\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s been messing with stuff that\u2019s too big for him, if you get my drift.\u201d\n\nMalfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who suddenly felt sick. Did Malfoy know something? His father was a Death Eater, after all; what if he had information about Hagrid\u2019s fate that had not yet reached the Order\u2019s ears? He hurried back around the table to Ron and Hermione, who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment and quill, crouched down beside the others, and related in a whisper what Malfoy had just said.\n\n\u201cDumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,\u201d said Hermione at once. \u201cIt\u2019s just playing into Malfoy\u2019s hands to look worried, it tells him we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on. We\u2019ve got to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its face . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d came Malfoy\u2019s clear drawl from the group nearest them, \u201cFather was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry\u2019s really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he\u2019ll probably be sent packing straight away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOUCH!\u201d\n\nHarry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped; it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there. Harry dropped it; Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full tilt toward the forest, a little, moving stickman soon swallowed up by the tree roots. When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds Harry rolled up his bloodstained bowtruckle picture and marched off to Herbology with his hand wrapped in a handkerchief of Hermione\u2019s and Malfoy\u2019s derisive laughter still ringing in his ears.\n\n\u201cIf he calls Hagrid a moron one more time . . .\u201d snarled Harry.\n\n\u201cHarry, don\u2019t go picking a row with Malfoy, don\u2019t forget, he\u2019s a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, I wonder what it\u2019d be like to have a difficult life?\u201d said Harry sarcastically. Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together they traipsed across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not.\n\n\u201cI just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. \u201cAnd don\u2019t say that Grubbly-Plank woman\u2019s a better teacher!\u201d he added threateningly.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to,\u201d said Hermione calmly.\n\n\u201cBecause she\u2019ll never be as good as Hagrid,\u201d said Harry firmly, fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.\n\nThe door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth years spilled out of it, including Ginny.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds later, Luna Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head. When she saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him. Many of his classmates turned curiously to watch. Luna took a great breath and then said, without so much as a preliminary hello: \u201cI believe He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought him and escaped from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 right,\u201d said Harry awkwardly. Luna was wearing what looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati and Lavender seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobes.\n\n\u201cYou can laugh!\u201d Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she was wearing. \u201cBut people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they were right, weren\u2019t they?\u201d said Hermione impatiently. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack.\u201d\n\nLuna gave her a withering look and flounced away, radishes swinging madly. Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with laughter now.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you mind not offending the only people who believe me?\u201d Harry asked Hermione as they made their way into class.\n\n\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake, Harry, you can do better than her,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cGinny\u2019s told me all about her, apparently she\u2019ll only believe in things as long as there\u2019s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn\u2019t expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.\u201d\n\nHarry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the night he had arrived and how Luna had said she could see them too. His spirits sank slightly. Had she been lying? But before he could devote much more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped up to him.\n\n\u201cI want you to know, Potter,\u201d he said in a loud, carrying voice, \u201cthat it\u2019s not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one hundred percent. My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, and so do I.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 thanks very much, Ernie,\u201d said Harry, taken aback but pleased. Ernie might be pompous on occasions like these, but Harry was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who was not wearing radishes in their ears. Ernie\u2019s words had certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Brown\u2019s face and, as he turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry caught Seamus\u2019s expression, which looked both confused and defiant.\n\nTo nobody\u2019s surprise, Professor Sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of O.W.L.s. Harry wished all the teachers would stop doing this; he was starting to get an anxious, twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class. Tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprout\u2019s preferred brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle, none of them talking very much; it had been another long day.\n\nAs Harry was starving, and he had his first detention with Umbridge at five o\u2019clock, he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him. He had barely reached the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice said, \u201cOy, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d he muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a towering temper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what now,\u201d she said, marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger. \u201cHow come you\u2019ve landed yourself in detention for five o\u2019clock on Friday?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhy . . . oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow he remembers!\u201d snarled Angelina. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I wanted to do a tryout with the whole team, and find someone who fitted in with everyone? Didn\u2019t I tell you I\u2019d booked the Quidditch pitch specially? And now you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re not going to be there!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t decide not to be there!\u201d said Harry, stung by the injustice of these words. \u201cI got detention from that Umbridge woman, just because I told her the truth about You-Know-Who \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on Friday,\u201d said Angelina fiercely, \u201cand I don\u2019t care how you do it, tell her You-Know-Who\u2019s a figment of your imagination if you like, just make sure you\u2019re there!\u201d\n\nShe stormed away.\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. \u201cI think we\u2019d better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood\u2019s been killed during a training session, because she seems to be channeling his spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday?\u201d said Ron skeptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.\n\n\u201cLess than zero,\u201d said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops onto his plate and starting to eat. \u201cBetter try, though, hadn\u2019t I? I\u2019ll offer to do two more detentions or something, I dunno . . .\u201d He swallowed a mouthful of potato and added, \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t keep me too long this evening. You realize we\u2019ve got to write three essays, practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a countercharm for Flitwick, finish the bowtruckle drawing, and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney?\u201d\n\nRon moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cAnd it looks like it\u2019s going to rain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with our homework?\u201d said Hermione, her eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Ron at once, his ears reddening.\n\nAt five to five Harry bade the other two good-bye and set off for Umbridge\u2019s office on the third floor. When he knocked on the door she said, \u201cCome in,\u201d in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking around.\n\nHe had known this office under three of its previous occupants. In the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portraits of its owner. When Lupin had occupied it, it was likely you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moody\u2019s days it had been packed with various instruments and artifacts for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment.\n\nNow, however, it looked totally unrecognizable. The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full of dried flowers, each residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large Technicolored kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. These were so foul that Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke again.\n\n\u201cGood evening, Mr. Potter.\u201d\n\nHarry started and looked around. He had not noticed her at first because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d Harry said stiffly.\n\n\u201cWell, sit down,\u201d she said, pointing toward a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry, without moving. \u201cProfessor Umbridge? Er \u2014 before we start, I-I wanted to ask you a . . . a favor.\u201d\n\nHer bulging eyes narrowed.\n\n\u201cOh yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o\u2019clock on Friday and I was \u2014 was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it \u2014 do it another night . . . instead . . .\u201d\n\nHe knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was no good.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly. \u201cOh no, no, no. This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one\u2019s convenience. No, you will come here at five o\u2019clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will do your detentions as planned. I think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you.\u201d\n\nHarry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ears. So he told evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, did he?\n\nShe was watching him with her head slightly to one side, still smiling widely, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was waiting to see whether he would start shouting again. With a massive effort Harry looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag beside the straight-backed chair, and sat down.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Umbridge sweetly, \u201cwe\u2019re getting better at controlling our temper already, aren\u2019t we? Now, you are going to be doing some lines for me, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill,\u201d she added, as Harry bent down to open his bag. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be using a rather special one of mine. Here you are.\u201d\n\nShe handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp point.\n\n\u201cI want you to write \u2018I must not tell lies,\u2019\u201d she told him softly.\n\n\u201cHow many times?\u201d Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of politeness.\n\n\u201cOh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,\u201d said Umbridge sweetly. \u201cOff you go.\u201d\n\nShe moved over to her desk, sat down, and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking. Harry raised the sharp black quill and then realized what was missing.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t given me any ink,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOh, you won\u2019t need ink,\u201d said Professor Umbridge with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice.\n\nHarry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: I must not tell lies.\n\nHe let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink. At the same time, the words had appeared on the back of Harry\u2019s right hand, cut into his skin as though traced there by a scalpel \u2014 yet even as he stared at the shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth.\n\nHarry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching him, her wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\nHe looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his skin, once again they healed over seconds later.\n\nAnd on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the parchment in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own blood. And again and again the words were cut into the back of his hand, healed, and then reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment.\n\nDarkness fell outside Umbridge\u2019s window. Harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not even if he had to sit here all night, cutting open his own hand with this quill. . . .\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d she said, after what seemed hours.\n\nHe stood up. His hand was stinging painfully. When he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was red raw.\n\n\u201cHand,\u201d she said.\n\nHe extended it. She took it in her own. Harry repressed a shudder as she touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore a number of ugly old rings.\n\n\u201cTut, tut, I don\u2019t seem to have made much of an impression yet,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won\u2019t we? You may go.\u201d\n\nHarry left her office without a word. The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor then, when he had turned the corner and was sure that she would not hear him, broke into a run.\n\n\nHe had not had time to practice Vanishing Spells, had not written a single dream in his dream diary, and had not finished the drawing of the bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled Ron keeping him company.\n\n\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t do it last night?\u201d Harry asked, as Ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about \u201cdoing other stuff,\u201d bent low over his parchment, and scrawled a few words.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll have to do,\u201d he said, slamming the diary shut, \u201cI\u2019ve said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can\u2019t make anything weird out of that, can she?\u201d\n\nThey hurried off to North Tower together.\n\n\u201cHow was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make you do?\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, \u201cLines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not too bad, then, eh?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHey \u2014 I forgot \u2014 did she let you off for Friday?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\nRon groaned sympathetically.\n\nIt was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning that he would not be able to attend Friday\u2019s Keeper tryouts, told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in detention!\u201d Harry yelled after her as she stalked away. \u201cD\u2019you think I\u2019d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s only lines,\u201d said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back onto his bench and looked down at his steak-and-kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a dreadful punishment, really . . .\u201d\n\nHarry opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded. He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge\u2019s room: He only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much homework we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Ron miserably.\n\n\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you do any last night?\u201d Hermione asked him. \u201cWhere were you anyway?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was . . . I fancied a walk,\u201d said Ron shiftily.\n\nHarry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment.\n\n\nThe second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on the back of Harry\u2019s hand became irritated more quickly now, red and inflamed; Harry thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for long. Soon the cut would remain etched in his hand and Umbridge would, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no moan of pain escape him, however, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but \u201cGood evening\u201d and \u201cGood night.\u201d\n\nHis homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape\u2019s moonstone essay. It was half-past two by the time he had finished it. He knew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next. He then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed, where he fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers and fell asleep immediately.\n\nThursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed very sleepy too, though Harry could not see why he should be. Harry\u2019s third detention passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two hours the words \u201cI must not tell lies\u201d did not fade from the back of Harry\u2019s hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood. The pause in the pointed quill\u2019s scratching made Professor Umbridge look up.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said softly, moving around her desk to examine his hand herself. \u201cGood. That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn\u2019t it? You may leave for tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I still have to come back tomorrow?\u201d said Harry, picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, smiling widely as before. \u201cYes, I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nHe had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape, but as he walked back toward Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found a contender. She\u2019s evil, he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, she\u2019s an evil, twisted, mad, old \u2014\n\n\u201cRon?\u201d\n\nHe had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost walked into Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the Lanky, clutching his broomstick. He gave a great leap of surprise when he saw Harry and attempted to hide his new Cleansweep Eleven behind his back.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 nothing. What are you doing?\u201d\n\nHarry frowned at him.\n\n\u201cCome on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThey just went past with a bunch of first years, I bet they\u2019re testing stuff on them again, I mean, they can\u2019t do it in the common room now, can they, not with Hermione there.\u201d\n\nHe was talking in a very fast, feverish way.\n\n\u201cBut what have you got your broom for, you haven\u2019t been flying, have you?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 well \u2014 well, okay, I\u2019ll tell you, but don\u2019t laugh, all right?\u201d Ron said defensively, turning redder with every second. \u201cI-I thought I\u2019d try out for Gryffindor Keeper now I\u2019ve got a decent broom. There. Go on. Laugh.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not laughing,\u201d said Harry. Ron blinked. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant idea! It\u2019d be really cool if you got on the team! I\u2019ve never seen you play Keeper, are you good?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not bad,\u201d said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry\u2019s reaction. \u201cCharlie, Fred, and George always made me Keep for them when they were training during the holidays.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve been practicing tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery evening since Tuesday . . . just on my own, though, I\u2019ve been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn\u2019t been easy and I don\u2019t know how much use it\u2019ll be.\u201d Ron looked nervous and anxious. \u201cFred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when I turn up for the tryouts. They haven\u2019t stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made a prefect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I was going to be there,\u201d said Harry bitterly, as they set off together toward the common room.\n\n\u201cYeah, so do \u2014 Harry, what\u2019s that on the back of your hand?\u201d\n\nHarry, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand, tried to hide it, but had as much success as Ron with his Cleansweep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a cut \u2014 it\u2019s nothing \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Ron had grabbed Harry\u2019s forearm and pulled the back of Harry\u2019s hand up level with his eyes. There was a pause, during which he stared at the words carved into the skin, then he released Harry, looking sick.\n\n\u201cI thought you said she was giving you lines?\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe old hag!\u201d Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her head against her frame. \u201cShe\u2019s sick! Go to McGonagall, say something!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cI\u2019m not giving her the satisfaction of knowing she\u2019s got to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGot to you? You can\u2019t let her get away with this!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much power McGonagall\u2019s got over her,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got enough on his mind,\u201d said Harry, but that was not the true reason. He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when Dumbledore had not spoken to him once since last June.\n\n\u201cWell, I reckon you should \u2014\u201d Ron began, but he was interrupted by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out, \u201cAre you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?\u201d\n\n\nFriday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though Harry glanced toward the staff table automatically when he entered the Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing Hagrid and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with Umbridge.\n\nTwo things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to see something of Ron\u2019s tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts.\n\nAt five o\u2019clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge\u2019s office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it.\n\n\u201cYou know what to do, Mr. Potter,\u201d said Umbridge, smiling sweetly over at him.\n\nHarry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right . . . On the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table he managed it. He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance.\n\nI must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh.\n\nI must not tell lies. The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting.\n\nI must not tell lies. Blood trickled down his wrist.\n\nHe chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared watch. Hoping very much that the Keeper wasn\u2019t Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the parchment dotted with blood.\n\nI must not tell lies.\n\nI must not tell lies.\n\nHe looked up whenever he thought he could risk it, when he could hear the scratching of Umbridge\u2019s quill or the opening of a desk drawer. The third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save. The sky was darkening so that Harry doubted he would be able to watch the sixth and seventh people at all.\n\nI must not tell lies.\n\nI must not tell lies.\n\nThe parchment was now shining with drops of blood from the back of his hand, which was searing with pain. When he next looked up, night had fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019ve gotten the message yet, shall we?\u201d said Umbridge\u2019s soft voice half an hour later.\n\nShe moved toward him, stretching out her short be-ringed fingers for his arm. And then, as she took hold of him to examine the words now cut into his skin, pain seared, not across the back of his hand, but across the scar on his forehead. At the same time, he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff.\n\nHe wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at her. She looked back at him, a smile stretching her wide, slack mouth.\n\n\u201cYes, it hurts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she said softly.\n\nHe did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead?\n\n\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ve made my point, Mr. Potter. You may go.\u201d\n\nHe caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he could.\n\nStay calm, he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs. Stay calm, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean what you think it means. . . .\n\n\u201cMimbulus mimbletonia!\u201d he gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung forward once more.\n\nA roar of sound greeted him. Ron came running toward him, beaming all over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from the goblet he was clutching.\n\n\u201cHarry, I did it, I\u2019m in, I\u2019m Keeper!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh \u2014 brilliant!\u201d said Harry, trying to smile naturally, while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled.\n\n\u201cHave a butterbeer.\u201d Ron pressed a bottle onto him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it \u2014 where\u2019s Hermione gone?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s there,\u201d said Fred, who was also swigging butterbeer, and pointed to an armchair by the fire. Hermione was dozing in it, her drink tipping precariously in her hand.\n\n\u201cWell, she said she was pleased when I told her,\u201d said Ron, looking slightly put out.\n\n\u201cLet her sleep,\u201d said George hastily. It was a few moments before Harry noticed that several of the first years gathered around them bore unmistakable signs of recent nosebleeds.\n\n\u201cCome here, Ron, and see if Oliver\u2019s old robes fit you,\u201d called Katie Bell. \u201cWe can take off his name and put yours on instead . . .\u201d\n\nAs Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry.\n\n\u201cSorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful, this managing lark, you know, I\u2019m starting to think I was a bit hard on Wood sometimes.\u201d She was watching Ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face.\n\n\u201cLook, I know he\u2019s your best mate, but he\u2019s not fabulous,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cI think with a bit of training he\u2019ll be all right, though. He comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I\u2019m banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper\u2019s a real whiner, he\u2019s always moaning about something or other, and Vicky\u2019s involved in all sorts of societies, she admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charm Club she\u2019d put Charms first. Anyway, we\u2019re having a practice session at two o\u2019clock tomorrow, so just make sure you\u2019re there this time. And do me a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?\u201d\n\nHe nodded and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put down his bag.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry, it\u2019s you. . . . Good about Ron, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said blearily. \u201cI\u2019m just so \u2014 so \u2014 so tired,\u201d she yawned. \u201cI was up until one o\u2019clock making more hats. They\u2019re disappearing like mad!\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might accidentally pick them up.\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst. \u201cListen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge\u2019s office and she touched my arm . . .\u201d\n\nHermione listened closely. When Harry had finished she said slowly, \u201cYou\u2019re worried that You-Know-Who\u2019s controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry, dropping his voice, \u201cit\u2019s a possibility, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he\u2019s properly alive again now, isn\u2019t he, he\u2019s got his own body, he wouldn\u2019t need to share someone else\u2019s. He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose . . .\u201d\n\nHarry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, \u201cBut last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn\u2019t Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this hasn\u2019t got anything to do with Umbridge at all, maybe it\u2019s just coincidence it happened while you were with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s evil,\u201d said Harry flatly. \u201cTwisted.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s horrible, yes, but . . . Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.\u201d\n\nIt was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his answer to Ron.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s been hurting on and off all summer \u2014 it was just a bit worse tonight, that\u2019s all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, before he could stop himself, \u201cthat\u2019s the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn\u2019t it, my scar?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that, it\u2019s not true!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you can\u2019t put something like that in a letter!\u201d said Hermione, looking alarmed. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing! We just can\u2019t guarantee owls aren\u2019t being intercepted anymore!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, I won\u2019t tell him, then!\u201d said Harry irritably. He got to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Hermione, looking relieved, \u201cif you\u2019re going that means I can go without being rude too, I\u2019m absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, it\u2019s quite fun, I\u2019m getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.\u201d\n\nHarry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer.\n\n\u201cEr . . . no, I don\u2019t think I will, thanks,\u201d he said. \u201cEr \u2014 not tomorrow. I\u2019ve got loads of homework to do . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he traipsed off to the boys\u2019 stairs, leaving her looking slightly disappointed behind him."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter14": "PERCY AND PADFOOT\n\n\n\n\nHarry was the first to awake in his dormitory next morning. He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of sunlight falling through the gap in his four-poster\u2019s hangings and savored the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed to have dragged on forever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson.\n\nJudging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the curtains around his bed, got up, and started to dress. The only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing of his fellow Gryffindors. He opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled out parchment and quill, and headed out of the dormitory for the common room.\n\nMaking straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars, and candy wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione\u2019s elf hats. Wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard. . . . But after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what to say.\n\nHe could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and Hermione to write him letters over the summer. How was he supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to have?\n\nHe sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then, finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely upon the parchment.\n\nDear Snuffles,\n\nHope you\u2019re okay, the first week back here\u2019s been terrible, I\u2019m really glad it\u2019s the weekend.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. She\u2019s nearly as nice as your mum. I\u2019m writing because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge.\n\nWe\u2019re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he\u2019ll be back soon.\n\nPlease write back quickly.\n\nBest,\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry reread this letter several times, trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what he was talking about \u2014 or who he was talking to \u2014 just from reading this letter. He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid and tell them when he might be back: Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up to while he was not at Hogwarts.\n\nConsidering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it, and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment carefully he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery.\n\n\u201cI would not go that way if I were you,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick, drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of him as he walked down the passage. \u201cPeeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person\u2019s head?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cFunnily enough, it does,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored voice. \u201cSubtlety has never been Peeves\u2019s strong point. I\u2019m off to try and find the Bloody Baron. . . . He might be able to put a stop to it. . . . See you, Harry . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, \u2019bye,\u201d said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left, taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last \u2014\n\nSomething brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the caretaker\u2019s skeletal gray cat, Mrs. Norris, slinking past him. She turned lamplike yellow eyes upon him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything wrong,\u201d Harry called after her. She had the unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the Owlery on a Saturday morning.\n\nThe sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of Hedwig.\n\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling. \u201cGet down here, I\u2019ve got a letter for you.\u201d\n\nWith a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down onto his shoulder.\n\n\u201cRight, I know this says \u2018Snuffles\u2019 on the outside,\u201d he told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly why, whispering, \u201cbut it\u2019s for Sirius, okay?\u201d\n\nShe blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood.\n\n\u201cSafe flight, then,\u201d said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moment\u2019s pressure on his arm Hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid\u2019s hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney smokeless, the curtains drawn.\n\nThe treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze. Harry watched them, savoring the fresh air on his face, thinking about Quidditch later . . . and then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged horse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl\u2019s, rose up out of the trees like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle and then plunged once more into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was hammering madly.\n\nThe Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock, and turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hands.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Harry automatically.\n\n\u201cOh . . . hi,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would be up here this early. . . . I only remembered five minutes ago, it\u2019s my mum\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nShe held up the parcel.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry. His brain seemed to have jammed. He wanted to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind.\n\n\u201cNice day,\u201d he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the weather. . . .\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. \u201cGood Quidditch conditions. I haven\u2019t been out all week, have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\nCho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down onto her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel.\n\n\u201cHey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s my friend Ron Weasley, d\u2019you know him?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Tornado-hater?\u201d said Cho rather coolly. \u201cIs he any good?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI think so. I didn\u2019t see his tryout, though, I was in detention.\u201d\n\nCho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owl\u2019s legs.\n\n\u201cThat Umbridge woman\u2019s foul,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cPutting you in detention just because you told the truth about how \u2014 how \u2014 how he died. Everyone heard about it, it was all over the school. You were really brave standing up to her like that.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s insides reinflated so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared about a stupid flying horse, Cho thought he had been really brave. . . . For a moment he considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel onto her owl. . . . But the very instant that this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened again.\n\nFilch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the room. There were purple patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and his thin gray hair disheveled; he had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily. There was a restless shifting of wings from above, and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward Harry, his pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. \u201cI\u2019ve had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!\u201d\n\nHarry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker.\n\n\u201cWho told you I was ordering Dungbombs?\u201d\n\nCho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it.\n\n\u201cI have my sources,\u201d said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. \u201cNow hand over whatever it is you\u2019re sending.\u201d\n\nFeeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter, Harry said, \u201cI can\u2019t, it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone?\u201d said Filch, his face contorting with rage.\n\n\u201cGone,\u201d said Harry calmly.\n\nFilch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then raked Harry\u2019s robes with his eyes. \u201cHow do I know you haven\u2019t got it in your pocket?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw him send it,\u201d said Cho angrily.\n\nFilch rounded on her.\n\n\u201cYou saw him \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I saw him,\u201d she said fiercely.\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho glared right back, then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward the door. He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at Harry.\n\n\u201cIf I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb . . .\u201d\n\nHe stumped off down the stairs. Mrs. Norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him.\n\nHarry and Cho looked at each other.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl\u2019s other leg, her face slightly pink. \u201cYou weren\u2019t ordering Dungbombs, were you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI wonder why he thought you were, then?\u201d she said, as she carried the owl to the window.\n\nHarry shrugged; he was quite as mystified by that as she was, though, oddly, it was not bothering him very much at the moment.\n\nThey left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led toward the west wing of the castle, Cho said, \u201cI\u2019m going this way. Well, I\u2019ll . . . I\u2019ll see you around, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . see you.\u201d\n\nShe smiled at him and departed. He walked on, feeling quietly elated. He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once. . . . You were really brave standing up to her like that. . . . She had called him brave. . . . She did not hate him for being alive. . . .\n\nOf course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that. . . . Though if he\u2019d only asked her to the ball before Cedric had, things might have turned out differently. . . . She had seemed sincerely sorry that she had to refuse when Harry had asked her. . . .\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione, joining them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking so pleased about?\u201d said Ron, eyeing Harry in surprise.\n\n\u201cErm . . . Quidditch later,\u201d said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs toward him.\n\n\u201cOh . . . yeah . . .\u201d said Ron. He put down the bit of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. Then he said, \u201cListen . . . you don\u2019t fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to \u2014 er \u2014 give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t think you should,\u201d said Hermione seriously, \u201cyou\u2019re both really behind on homework as it \u2014\u201d\n\nBut she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the Daily Prophet was soaring toward her in the beak of a screech owl, which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg; Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper, and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off again.\n\n\u201cAnything interesting?\u201d said Ron; Harry smiled \u2014 he knew Ron was keen to get her off the subject of homework.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she sighed, \u201cjust some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married . . .\u201d\n\nShe opened the paper and disappeared behind it. Harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon; Ron was staring up at the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied.\n\n\u201cWait a moment,\u201d said Hermione suddenly. \u201cOh no . . . Sirius!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d said Harry, and he snatched at the paper so violently that it ripped down the middle so that he and Hermione were holding half each.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer . . . blah blah blah . . . is currently hiding in London!\u2019\u201d Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper.\n\n\u201cLucius Malfoy, I\u2019ll bet anything,\u201d said Harry in a low, furious voice. \u201cHe did recognize Sirius on the platform . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron, looking alarmed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShh!\u201d said the other two.\n\n\u201c. . . \u2018Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous . . . killed thirteen people . . . broke out of Azkaban . . .\u2019 the usual rubbish,\u201d Hermione concluded, laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at Harry and Ron. \u201cWell, he just won\u2019t be able to leave the house again, that\u2019s all,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDumbledore did warn him not to.\u201d\n\nHarry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off. Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madame Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d he said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could both see it. \u201cLook at this!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got all the robes I want,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201clook . . . this little piece here . . .\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column. It was headlined:\n\n\n\nTRESPASS AT MINISTRY\n\nSturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August. Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to force his way through a top-security door at one o\u2019clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to speak in his own defense, was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSturgis Podmore?\u201d said Ron slowly, \u201cbut he\u2019s that bloke who looks like his head\u2019s been thatched, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s one of the Ord \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, shh!\u201d said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them.\n\n\u201cSix months in Azkaban!\u201d whispered Harry, shocked. \u201cJust for trying to get through a door!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, it wasn\u2019t just for trying to get through a door \u2014 what on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d breathed Hermione.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you reckon he was doing something for the Order?\u201d Ron muttered.\n\n\u201cWait a moment . . .\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cSturgis was supposed to come and see us off, remember?\u201d\n\nThe other two looked at him.\n\n\u201cYeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King\u2019s Cross, remember? And Moody was all annoyed because he didn\u2019t turn up, so that doesn\u2019t seem like he was supposed to be on a job for them, does it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, maybe they didn\u2019t expect him to get caught,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cIt could be a frame-up!\u201d Ron exclaimed excitedly. \u201cNo \u2014 listen!\u201d he went on, dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on Hermione\u2019s face. \u201cThe Ministry suspects he\u2019s one of Dumbledore\u2019s lot so \u2014 I dunno \u2014 they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn\u2019t trying to get through a door at all! Maybe they\u2019ve just made something up to get him!\u201d\n\nThere was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this. Harry thought it seemed far-fetched; Hermione, on the other hand, looked rather impressed and said, \u201cDo you know, I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if that were true.\u201d\n\nShe folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully. When Harry laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie.\n\n\u201cRight, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self-Fertilizing Shrubs first, and if we\u2019re lucky we\u2019ll be able to start McGonagall\u2019s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating blue, and he had not been on his Firebolt all week. . . .\n\n\u201cI mean, we can do it tonight,\u201d said Ron, as he and Harry walked down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, Hermione\u2019s dire warnings that they would fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got tomorrow. She gets too worked up about work, that\u2019s her trouble . . .\u201d There was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, \u201cD\u2019you think she meant it when she said we weren\u2019t copying from her?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d said Harry. \u201cStill, this is important too, we\u2019ve got to practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Ron in a heartened tone. \u201cAnd we have got plenty of time to do it all . . .\u201d\n\nHarry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch pitch, to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly. Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry about; the flying horse wasn\u2019t doing him any harm: He pushed it out of his mind.\n\nThey collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced. After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that she thought they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the real training session. All their teammates but Angelina were already in the changing room when they entered.\n\n\u201cAll right, Ron?\u201d said George, winking at him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch.\n\n\u201cReady to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?\u201d said Fred, emerging tousle-haired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly malicious grin on his face.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes for the first time. They fitted him well considering they had been Oliver Wood\u2019s, who was rather broader in the shoulder.\n\n\u201cOkay everyone,\u201d said Angelina, entering from the Captain\u2019s office, already changed. \u201cLet\u2019s get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring the ball crate out for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right?\u201d\n\nSomething in her would-be casual voice made Harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough, when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch team and assorted hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that Weasley\u2019s riding?\u201d Malfoy called in his sneering drawl. \u201cWhy would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like that?\u201d\n\nCrabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter. Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and Harry followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind.\n\n\u201cIgnore them,\u201d he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who\u2019s laughing after we play them . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly the attitude I want, Harry,\u201d said Angelina approvingly, soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team. \u201cOkay everyone, we\u2019re going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team please \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, Johnson, what\u2019s with that hairstyle anyway?\u201d shrieked Pansy Parkinson from below. \u201cWhy would anyone want to look like they\u2019ve got worms coming out of their head?\u201d\n\nAngelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and said calmly, \u201cSpread out, then, and let\u2019s see what we can do . . .\u201d\n\nHarry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch. Ron fell back toward the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it.\n\nThe Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter. Ron, who had pelted toward the ground to catch the Quaffle before it landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything, for which he was grateful.\n\n\u201cPass it on, Ron,\u201d called Angelina, as though nothing had happened.\n\nRon threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who passed to George. . . .\n\n\u201cHey, Potter, how\u2019s your scar feeling?\u201d called Malfoy. \u201cSure you don\u2019t need a lie-down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were in the hospital wing, that\u2019s a record for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nFred passed to Angelina; she reverse passed to Harry, who had not been expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches.\n\n\u201cCome on now, Ron,\u201d said Angelina crossly, as Ron dived for the ground again, chasing the Quaffle. \u201cPay attention.\u201d\n\nIt would have been hard to say whether Ron\u2019s face or the Quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he returned again to playing height. Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter.\n\nOn his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through Katie\u2019s outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face.\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Ron groaned, zooming forward to see whether he had done any damage.\n\n\u201cGet back in position, she\u2019s fine!\u201d barked Angelina. \u201cBut as you\u2019re passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won\u2019t you? We\u2019ve got Bludgers for that!\u201d\n\nKatie\u2019s nose was bleeding. Down below the Slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering. Fred and George converged on Katie.\n\n\u201cHere, take this,\u201d Fred told her, handing her something small and purple from out of his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019ll clear it up in no time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d called Angelina, \u201cFred, George, go and get your bats and a Bludger; Ron, get up to the goalposts, Harry, release the Snitch when I say so. We\u2019re going to aim for Ron\u2019s goal, obviously.\u201d\n\nHarry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch.\n\n\u201cRon\u2019s making a right pig\u2019s ear of things, isn\u2019t he?\u201d muttered George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just nervous,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe was fine when I was practicing with him this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I hope he hasn\u2019t peaked too soon,\u201d said Fred gloomily.\n\nThey returned to the air. When Angelina blew her whistle, Harry released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger; from that moment on, Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing. It was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the Seeker\u2019s team and doing so required enormous speed and skill. He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping his face and the distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears. . . . But too soon, the whistle brought him to a halt again.\n\n\u201cStop \u2014 stop \u2014 STOP!\u201d screamed Angelina. \u201cRon \u2014 you\u2019re not covering your middle post!\u201d\n\nHarry looked around at Ron, who was hovering in front of the left-hand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected.\n\n\u201cOh . . . sorry . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep shifting around while you\u2019re watching the Chasers!\u201d said Angelina. \u201cEither stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don\u2019t drift vaguely off to one side, that\u2019s how you let in the last three goals!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry . . .\u201d Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky.\n\n\u201cAnd Katie, can\u2019t you do something about that nosebleed?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just getting worse!\u201d said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve.\n\nHarry glanced around at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking his pockets. He saw Fred pull out something purple, examine it for a second, and then look around at Katie, evidently horrorstruck.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s try again,\u201d said Angelina. She was ignoring the Slytherins, who had now set up a chant of \u201cGryffindor are losers, Gryffindor are losers,\u201d but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless.\n\nThis time they had been flying for barely three minutes when Angelina\u2019s whistle sounded. Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest.\n\n\u201cKatie,\u201d she said shortly.\n\nHarry turned and saw Angelina, Fred, and George all flying as fast as they could toward Katie. Harry and Alicia sped toward her too. It was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was now chalk-white and covered in blood.\n\n\u201cShe needs the hospital wing,\u201d said Angelina.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take her,\u201d said Fred. \u201cShe \u2014 er \u2014 might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone,\u201d said Angelina glumly, as Fred and George zoomed off toward the castle supporting Katie between them. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go and get changed.\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing rooms.\n\n\u201cHow was practice?\u201d asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour later, as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the Gryffindor common room.\n\n\u201cIt was \u2014\u201d Harry began.\n\n\u201cCompletely lousy,\u201d said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair beside Hermione. She looked up at Ron and her frostiness seemed to melt.\n\n\u201cWell, it was only your first one,\u201d she said consolingly, \u201cit\u2019s bound to take time to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho said it was me who made it lousy?\u201d snapped Ron.\n\n\u201cNo one,\u201d said Hermione, looking taken aback, \u201cI thought \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought I was bound to be rubbish?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, of course I didn\u2019t! Look, you said it was lousy so I just \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get started on some homework,\u201d said Ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys\u2019 dormitories and vanished from sight. Hermione turned to Harry.\n\n\u201cWas he lousy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry loyally.\n\nHermione raised her eyebrows.\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose he could\u2019ve played better,\u201d Harry muttered, \u201cbut it was only the first training session, like you said . . .\u201d\n\nNeither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the chant of \u201cGryffindor are losers\u201d out of his head.\n\nThey spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in their books while the room around them filled up, then emptied: It was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year. By the evening Harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull.\n\n\u201cYou know, we probably should try and get more homework done during the week,\u201d Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside Professor McGonagall\u2019s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra\u2019s equally long and difficult essay about Jupiter\u2019s moons.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. \u201cListen . . . shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she\u2019s done?\u201d\n\nHarry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said heavily, \u201cyou know she won\u2019t let us.\u201d\n\nAnd so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker; slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin again. At half-past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them, yawning.\n\n\u201cNearly done?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron shortly.\n\n\u201cJupiter\u2019s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,\u201d she said, pointing over Ron\u2019s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, \u201cand it\u2019s Io that\u2019s got the volcanos.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences.\n\n\u201cSorry, I only \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, if you\u2019ve just come over here to criticize \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I\u2019m up to my neck in it here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 look!\u201d\n\nHermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron both looked over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill, gazing into the room at Ron.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that Hermes?\u201d said Hermione, sounding amazed.\n\n\u201cBlimey, it is!\u201d said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and getting to his feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s Percy writing to me for?\u201d\n\nHe crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside, landed upon Ron\u2019s essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was attached. Ron took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky footprints across Ron\u2019s drawing of the moon Io.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely Percy\u2019s handwriting,\u201d said Ron, sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. He looked up at the other two. \u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon?\u201d\n\n\u201cOpen it!\u201d said Hermione eagerly. Harry nodded.\n\nRon unrolled the scroll and began to read. The farther down the parchment his eyes traveled, the more pronounced became his scowl. When he had finished reading, he looked disgusted. He thrust the letter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned toward each other to read it together:\n\nDear Ron,\n\nI have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister of Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor Umbridge) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect.\n\nI was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations. I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the \u201cFred and George\u201d route, rather than following in my footsteps, so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility.\n\nBut I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post. Hopefully you will be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions.\n\nFrom something the Minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that boy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this \u2014 no doubt you will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore\u2019s favorite \u2014 but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different \u2014 and probably more accurate \u2014 view of Potter\u2019s behavior. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing \u2014 and see if you can spot yours truly!\n\nSeriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too. As you must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the people I\u2019ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt.\n\nIt may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter \u2014 I know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent \u2014 but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything else in Potter\u2019s behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know will be only too happy to advise you.\n\nThis leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted above, Dumbledore\u2019s regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Ministry. I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor Umbridge is encountering very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although she should find this easier from next week \u2014 again, see the Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this \u2014 a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well placed for Head Boyship in a couple of years!\n\nI am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around Dumbledore (if you are writing to Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore\u2019s, has recently been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders). I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people \u2014 the Minister really could not be more gracious to me \u2014 and I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents\u2019 beliefs and actions either. I sincerely hope that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes.\n\nPlease think over what I have said most carefully, particularly the bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becoming prefect.\n\nYour brother,\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry looked up at Ron.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke, \u201cif you want to \u2014 er \u2014 what is it?\u201d (He checked Percy\u2019s letter.) \u201cOh yeah \u2014 \u2018sever ties\u2019 with me, I swear I won\u2019t get violent.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it back,\u201d said Ron, holding out his hand. \u201cHe is \u2014\u201d Ron said jerkily, tearing Percy\u2019s letter in half, \u201cthe world\u2019s\u201d \u2014 he tore it into quarters \u2014 \u201cbiggest\u201d \u2014 he tore it into eighths \u2014 \u201cgit.\u201d He threw the pieces into the fire.\n\n\u201cCome on, we\u2019ve got to get this finished some time before dawn,\u201d he said briskly to Harry, pulling Professor Sinistra\u2019s essay back toward him.\n\nHermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her face.\n\n\u201cOh, give them here,\u201d she said abruptly.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cGive them to me, I\u2019ll look through them and correct them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAre you serious? Ah, Hermione, you\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d said Ron, \u201cwhat can I \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you can say is, \u2018We promise we\u2019ll never leave our homework this late again,\u2019\u201d she said, holding out both hands for their essays, but she looked slightly amused all the same.\n\n\u201cThanks a million, Hermione,\u201d said Harry weakly, passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes.\n\nIt was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and Crookshanks. The only sound was that of Hermione\u2019s quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table. Harry was exhausted. He also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire.\n\nHe knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him strange, even mad; he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to him for months, but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percy\u2019s writing, about knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales on him to Umbridge, that made his situation real to him as nothing else had. He had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house during the summers, shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup, had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent.\n\nAnd with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, Harry thought that Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situation; nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius a dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years. . . .\n\nHarry blinked. He had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there. It had flashed into sight and vanished immediately. No . . . it could not have been. . . . He had imagined it because he had been thinking about Sirius. . . .\n\n\u201cOkay, write that down,\u201d Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, \u201cand then copy out this conclusion that I\u2019ve written for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Ron weakly, \u201cand if I\u2019m ever rude to you again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 I\u2019ll know you\u2019re back to normal,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHarry, yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa\u2019s covered in ice, not mice \u2014 Harry?\u201d\n\nHarry had slid off his chair onto his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 Harry?\u201d said Ron uncertainly. \u201cWhy are you down there?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve just seen Sirius\u2019s head in the fire,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius\u2019s head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it too. Nevertheless, he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time. . . . It had vanished so quickly. . . .\n\n\u201cSirius\u2019s head?\u201d Hermione repeated. \u201cYou mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he wouldn\u2019t do that now, it would be too \u2014 Sirius!\u201d\n\nShe gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill. There in the middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius\u2019s head, long dark hair falling around his grinning face.\n\n\u201cI was starting to think you\u2019d go to bed before everyone else had disappeared,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking every hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been popping into the fire every hour?\u201d Harry said, half laughing.\n\n\u201cJust for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what if you\u2019d been seen?\u201d said Hermione anxiously.\n\n\u201cWell, I think a girl \u2014 first year by the look of her \u2014 might\u2019ve got a glimpse of me earlier, but don\u2019t worry,\u201d Sirius said hastily, as Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth. \u201cI was gone the moment she looked back at me and I\u2019ll bet she just thought I was an oddly shaped log or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Sirius, this is taking an awful risk \u2014\u201d Hermione began.\n\n\u201cYou sound like Molly,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cThis was the only way I could come up with of answering Harry\u2019s letter without resorting to a code \u2014 and codes are breakable.\u201d\n\nAt the mention of Harry\u2019s letter, Hermione and Ron had both turned to stare at him.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t say you\u2019d written to Sirius!\u201d said Hermione accusingly.\n\n\u201cI forgot,\u201d said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it was very good,\u201d said Sirius, smiling. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019d better be quick, just in case we\u2019re disturbed \u2014 your scar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about \u2014 ?\u201d Ron began, but Hermione said quickly, \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I know it can\u2019t be fun when it hurts, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to really worry about. It kept aching all last year, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,\u201d said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione\u2019s winces. \u201cSo maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or something the night I had that detention.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now he\u2019s back it\u2019s bound to hurt more often,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with her?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cI know her by reputation and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s no Death Eater \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s foul enough to be one,\u201d said Harry darkly and Ron and Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement.\n\n\u201cYes, but the world isn\u2019t split into good people and Death Eaters,\u201d said Sirius with a wry smile. \u201cI know she\u2019s a nasty piece of work, though \u2014 you should hear Remus talk about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Lupin know her?\u201d asked Harry quickly, remembering Umbridge\u2019s comments about dangerous half-breeds during her first lesson.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cbut she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.\u201d\n\nHarry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days and his dislike of Umbridge deepened even further.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she got against werewolves?\u201d said Hermione angrily.\n\n\u201cScared of them, I expect,\u201d said Sirius, smiling at her indignation. \u201cApparently she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too. Imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the loose \u2014\u201d\n\nRon laughed but Hermione looked upset.\n\n\u201cSirius!\u201d she said reproachfully. \u201cHonestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher I\u2019m sure he\u2019d respond, after all, you are the only member of his family he\u2019s got left, and Professor Dumbledore said \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what are Umbridge\u2019s lessons like?\u201d Sirius interrupted. \u201cIs she training you all to kill half-breeds?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, ignoring Hermione\u2019s affronted look at being cut off in her defense of Kreacher. \u201cShe\u2019s not letting us use magic at all!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we do is read the stupid textbook,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cAh, well, that figures,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cOur information from inside the Ministry is that Fudge doesn\u2019t want you trained in combat.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrained in combat?\u201d repeated Harry incredulously. \u201cWhat does he think we\u2019re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he thinks you\u2019re doing,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cor rather, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s afraid Dumbledore\u2019s doing \u2014 forming his own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause at this, then Ron said, \u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we\u2019ll use spells against the Ministry?\u201d said Hermione, looking furious.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cFudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power. He\u2019s getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day. It\u2019s a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped-up charge.\u201d\n\nThis reminded Harry of Percy\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cD\u2019you know if there\u2019s going to be anything about Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow? Only Ron\u2019s brother Percy reckons there will be \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone from the Order all weekend, they\u2019re all busy. It\u2019s just been Kreacher and me here . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cSo you haven\u2019t had any news about Hagrid, either?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh . . .\u201d said Sirius, \u201cwell, he was supposed to be back by now, no one\u2019s sure what\u2019s happened to him.\u201d Then, seeing their stricken faces, he added quickly, \u201cBut Dumbledore\u2019s not worried, so don\u2019t you three get yourselves in a state; I\u2019m sure Hagrid\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if he was supposed to be back by now . . .\u201d said Hermione in a small, worried voice.\n\n\u201cMadame Maxime was with him, we\u2019ve been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home \u2014 but there\u2019s nothing to suggest he\u2019s hurt or \u2014 well, nothing to suggest he\u2019s not perfectly okay.\u201d\n\nUnconvinced, Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged worried looks.\n\n\u201cListen, don\u2019t go asking too many questions about Hagrid,\u201d said Sirius hastily, \u201cit\u2019ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he\u2019s not back, and I know Dumbledore doesn\u2019t want that. Hagrid\u2019s tough, he\u2019ll be okay.\u201d And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius added, \u201cWhen\u2019s your next Hogsmeade weekend anyway? I was thinking, we got away with the dog disguise at the station, didn\u2019t we? I thought I could \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly.\n\n\u201cSirius, didn\u2019t you see the Daily Prophet?\u201d said Hermione anxiously.\n\n\u201cOh that,\u201d said Sirius, grinning, \u201cthey\u2019re always guessing where I am, they haven\u2019t really got a clue \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but we think this time they have,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSomething Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his father was on the platform, Sirius \u2014 you know, Lucius Malfoy \u2014 so don\u2019t come up here, whatever you do, if Malfoy recognizes you again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, I\u2019ve got the point,\u201d said Sirius. He looked most displeased. \u201cJust an idea, thought you might like to get together \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI would, I just don\u2019t want you chucked back in Azkaban!\u201d said Harry.\n\nThere was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease between his sunken eyes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re less like your father than I thought,\u201d he said finally, a definite coolness in his voice. \u201cThe risk would\u2019ve been what made it fun for James.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs,\u201d said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying. \u201cI\u2019ll write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can stand to risk it?\u201d\n\nThere was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius\u2019s head had been was flickering flame once more."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter15": "THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR\n\n\n\n\nThey had expected to have to comb Hermione\u2019s Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Umbridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline:\n\nMINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER \u201cHIGH INQUISITOR\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2018High Inquisitor\u2019?\u201d said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\nHermione read aloud:\n\n\u201cIn a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts for some time,\u2019 said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. \u2018He is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person.\n\n\u201c\u2018That\u2019s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,\u2019 said Weasley last night. \u2018Dumbledore couldn\u2019t find anyone, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she\u2019s been an immediate success \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been a WHAT?\u201d said Harry loudly.\n\n\u201cWait, there\u2019s more,\u201d said Hermione grimly.\n\n\u201c\u2018\u2014 an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-the-ground feedback about what\u2019s really happening at Hogwarts.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new position of \u2018Hogwarts High Inquisitor.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018This is an exciting new phase in the Minister\u2019s plan to get to grips with what some are calling the \u201cfalling standards\u201d at Hogwarts,\u2019 said Weasley. \u2018The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are delighted to say that she has accepted.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Ministry\u2019s new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts.\n\n\u201c\u2018I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,\u2019 said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. \u2018Many of us with our children\u2019s best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore\u2019s eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.\u2019\n\n\u201cAmong those \u2018eccentric decisions\u2019 are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional ex-Auror \u2018Mad-Eye\u2019 Moody.\n\n\u201cRumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts.\n\n\u201c\u2018I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,\u2019 said a Ministry insider last night.\n\n\u201cWizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.\n\n\u201c\u2018Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge\u2019s office,\u2019 said Madam Marchbanks. \u2018This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore.\u2019 (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks\u2019 alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17.)\u201d\n\nHermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two.\n\n\u201cSo now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed this \u2018Educational Decree\u2019 and forced her on us! And now he\u2019s given her the power to inspect other teachers!\u201d Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. It\u2019s outrageous . . . \u201d\n\n\u201cI know it is,\u201d said Harry. He looked down at his right hand, clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin.\n\nBut a grin was unfurling on Ron\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him.\n\n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to see McGonagall inspected,\u201d said Ron happily. \u201cUmbridge won\u2019t know what\u2019s hit her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, come on,\u201d said Hermione, jumping up, \u201cwe\u2019d better get going, if she\u2019s inspecting Binns\u2019s class we don\u2019t want to be late . . .\u201d\n\nBut Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in Snape\u2019s dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry\u2019s moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner.\n\n\u201cI have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L.,\u201d said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework. \u201cThis should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.\u201d\n\nSnape reached the front of the class and turned to face them.\n\n\u201cThe general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week\u2019s essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHe smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, \u201cSome people got D\u2019s? Ha!\u201d\n\nHarry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information private.\n\nDetermined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione\u2019s but it was at least blue rather than pink, like Neville\u2019s, and he delivered a flask of it to Snape\u2019s desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief.\n\n\u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t as bad as last week, was it?\u201d said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall toward lunch. \u201cAnd the homework didn\u2019t go too badly either, did it?\u201d\n\nWhen neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, \u201cI mean, all right, I didn\u2019t expect the top grade, not if he\u2019s marking to O.W.L. standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\n\nHarry made a noncommittal noise in his throat.\n\n\u201cOf course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we\u2019ve got plenty of time to improve, but the grades we\u2019re getting now are a sort of baseline, aren\u2019t they? Something we can build on . . .\u201d\n\nThey sat down together at the Gryffindor table.\n\n\u201cObviously, I\u2019d have been thrilled if I\u2019d gotten an O \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d said Ron sharply, \u201cif you want to know what grades we got, ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean \u2014 well, if you want to tell me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a P,\u201d said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. \u201cHappy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry\u2019s right. \u201cNothing wrong with a good healthy P.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cdoesn\u2019t P stand for . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Poor,\u2019 yeah,\u201d said Lee Jordan. \u201cStill, better than D, isn\u2019t it? \u2018Dreadful\u2019?\u201d\n\nHarry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades.\n\n\u201cSo top grade\u2019s O for \u2018Outstanding,\u2019\u201d she was saying, \u201cand then there\u2019s A \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, E,\u201d George corrected her, \u201cE for \u2018Exceeds Expectations.\u2019 And I\u2019ve always thought Fred and I should\u2019ve got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.\u201d\n\nThey all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, \u201cSo after E, it\u2019s A for \u2018Acceptable,\u2019 and that\u2019s the last pass grade, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth, and swallowing it whole.\n\n\u201cThen you get P for \u2018Poor\u2019\u201d \u2014 Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration \u2014 \u201cand D for \u2018Dreadful.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then T,\u201d George reminded him.\n\n\u201cT?\u201d asked Hermione, looking appalled. \u201cEven lower than a D? What on earth does that stand for?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Troll,\u2019\u201d said George promptly.\n\nHarry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received T\u2019s in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on.\n\n\u201cYou lot had an inspected lesson yet?\u201d Fred asked them.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione at once, \u201chave you?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust now, before lunch,\u201d said George. \u201cCharms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d Harry and Hermione asked together.\n\nFred shrugged.\n\n\u201cNot that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what Flitwick\u2019s like, he treated her like a guest, didn\u2019t seem to bother him at all. She didn\u2019t say much. Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see old Flitwick getting marked down,\u201d said George, \u201che usually gets everyone through their exams all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019ve you got this afternoon?\u201d Fred asked Harry.\n\n\u201cTrelawney \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA T if ever I saw one \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and Umbridge herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,\u201d said George. \u201cAngelina\u2019ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.\u201d\n\nBut Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out Dream Oracles, look round.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Professor Trelawney,\u201d said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile. \u201cYou received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?\u201d\n\nProfessor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney\u2019s seat. She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin.\n\nProfessor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses. \u201cWe shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,\u201d she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. \u201cDivide into pairs, please, and interpret each other\u2019s latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.\u201d\n\nShe made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati\u2019s most recent dream.\n\nHarry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney\u2019s wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book.\n\n\u201cThink of a dream, quick,\u201d he told Ron, \u201cin case the old toad comes our way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did it last time,\u201d Ron protested, \u201cit\u2019s your turn, you tell me one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I dunno . . .\u201d said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \u201cLet\u2019s say I dreamed I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that\u2019ll do . . .\u201d\n\nRon chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle.\n\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject . . . would that be \u2018drowning\u2019 or \u2018cauldron\u2019 or \u2018Snape\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, pick any of them,\u201d said Harry, chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney\u2019s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary.\n\n\u201cWhat night did you dream this again?\u201d Ron said, immersed in calculations.\n\n\u201cI dunno, last night, whenever you like,\u201d Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, \u201cyou\u2019ve been in this post how long, exactly?\u201d\n\nProfessor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, \u201cNearly sixteen years.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite a period,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \u201cSo it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Professor Trelawney shortly.\n\nProfessor Umbridge made another note.\n\n\u201cAnd you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher.\n\nAnother note on the clipboard.\n\n\u201cBut I think \u2014 correct me if I am mistaken \u2014 that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese things often skip \u2014 er \u2014 three generations,\u201d said Professor Trelawney.\n\nProfessor Umbridge\u2019s toadlike smile widened.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said sweetly, making yet another note. \u201cWell, if you could just predict something for me, then?\u201d\n\nShe looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor Trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe her ears.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d said Professor Trelawney, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like you to make a prediction for me,\u201d said Professor Umbridge very clearly.\n\nHarry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height, her beads and bangles clinking.\n\n\u201cThe Inner Eye does not See upon command!\u201d she said in scandalized tones.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 but \u2014 but . . . wait!\u201d said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. \u201cI . . . I think I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . .\u201d\n\nProfessor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cI am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger!\u201d Professor Trelawney finished dramatically.\n\nThere was a pause. Professor Umbridge\u2019s eyebrows were still raised.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s really the best you can do . . .\u201d\n\nShe turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron\u2019s eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney\u2019s side \u2014 until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry\u2019s nose, uncharacteristically brisk. \u201cLet me see the start you\u2019ve made on your dream diary, please.\u201d\n\nAnd by the time she had interpreted Harry\u2019s dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later.\n\nShe was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell.\n\n\u201cWands away,\u201d she instructed them all smilingly, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags. \u201cAs we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, \u2018Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation.\u2019 There will be no need to talk.\u201d\n\nStill smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year\u2019s lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again.\n\nProfessor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, \u201cWhat is it this time, Miss Granger?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already read chapter two,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell then, proceed to chapter three.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read that too. I\u2019ve read the whole book.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly.\n\n\u201cWell, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says that counterjinxes are improperly named,\u201d said Hermione promptly. \u201cHe says \u2018counterjinx\u2019 is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge raised her eyebrows, and Harry knew she was impressed against her will.\n\n\u201cBut I disagree,\u201d Hermione continued.\n\nProfessor Umbridge\u2019s eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder.\n\n\u201cYou disagree?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class\u2019s attention. \u201cMr. Slinkhard doesn\u2019t like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they\u2019re used defensively.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you do, do you?\u201d said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard\u2019s opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d Hermione began.\n\n\u201cThat is enough,\u201d said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. \u201cMiss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House.\u201d\n\nThere was an outbreak of muttering at this.\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get involved!\u201d Hermione whispered urgently to him.\n\n\u201cFor disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,\u201d said Professor Umbridge smoothly. \u201cI am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but as none of them \u2014 with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects \u2014 would have passed a Ministry inspection \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,\u201d said Harry loudly, \u201cthere was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.\u201d\n\nThis pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then \u2014\n\n\u201cI think another week\u2019s detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter,\u201d said Umbridge sleekly.\n\n\nThe cut on the back of Harry\u2019s hand had barely healed and by the following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain during the evening\u2019s detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter.\n\nThe very worst part of this second week\u2019s worth of detentions was, just as George had predicted, Angelina\u2019s reaction. She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table.\n\n\u201cMiss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Professor \u2014 he\u2019s gone and landed himself in detention again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this, Potter?\u201d said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. \u201cDetention? From whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom Professor Umbridge,\u201d muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall\u2019s beady, square-framed eyes.\n\n\u201cAre you telling me,\u201d she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, \u201cthat after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge\u2019s class again?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry muttered, speaking to the floor.\n\n\u201cPotter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 what? Professor, no!\u201d Harry said, furious at this injustice. \u201cI\u2019m already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever!\u201d said Professor McGonagall tartly. \u201cNo, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy!\u201d\n\nShe strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which Harry flung himself onto the bench beside Ron, fuming.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s taken points off Gryffindor because I\u2019m having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, mate,\u201d said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry\u2019s plate, \u201cshe\u2019s bang out of order.\u201d\n\nHermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing.\n\n\u201cYou think McGonagall was right, do you?\u201d said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI wish she hadn\u2019t taken points from you, but I think she\u2019s right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,\u201d said Hermione\u2019s voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech.\n\nHarry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. \u201cLet\u2019s see Umbridge get what she deserves.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there.\n\n\u201cThat will do,\u201d she said and silence fell immediately. \u201cMr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework \u2014 Miss Brown, please take this box of mice \u2014 don\u2019t be silly, girl, they won\u2019t hurt you \u2014 and hand one to each student \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHem, hem,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Harry\u2019s essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A.\n\n\u201cRight then, everyone, listen closely \u2014 Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention \u2014 most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we shall be \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHem, hem,\u201d said Professor Umbridge.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line.\n\n\u201cI was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. \u201cAs I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHem, hem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder,\u201d said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, \u201chow you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.\n\n\u201cAs I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So \u2014 you know the incantation, let me see what you can do . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!\u201d Harry said to Ron under his voice, but he was grinning; his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated.\n\nProfessor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, take many more notes while she sat in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on her face.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a start,\u201d said Ron, holding up a long, wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around.\n\nAs they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teacher\u2019s desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\u201d Professor Umbridge asked.\n\n\u201cThirty-nine years this December,\u201d said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut.\n\nProfessor Umbridge made a note.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will receive the results of your inspection in ten days\u2019 time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hardly wait,\u201d said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off toward the door. \u201cHurry up, you three,\u201d she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her. Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return.\n\nHe had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank.\n\n\u201cYou do not usually take this class, is that correct?\u201d Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living twigs.\n\n\u201cQuite correct,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. \u201cI am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.\u201d\n\nHarry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly, \u201cI wonder \u2014 the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter \u2014 can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid\u2019s very extended leave of absence?\u201d\n\nHarry saw Malfoy look up eagerly.\n\n\u201c\u2019Fraid I can\u2019t,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. \u201cDon\u2019t know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work, accepted \u2014 that\u2019s as much as I know. Well . . . shall I get started then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, please do,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, scribbling upon her clipboard.\n\nUmbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harry\u2019s spirits lifted somewhat; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down.\n\n\u201cOverall,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor Grubbly-Plank\u2019s side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, \u201chow do you, as a temporary member of staff \u2014 an objective outsider, I suppose you might say \u2014 how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, Dumbledore\u2019s excellent,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. \u201cNo, I\u2019m very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.\u201d\n\nLooking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on, \u201cAnd what are you planning to cover with this class this year \u2014 assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L.,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \u201cNot much left to do \u2014 they\u2019ve studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we\u2019d cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you seem to know what you\u2019re doing, at any rate,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis she put on \u201cyou\u201d and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle: \u201cNow, I hear there have been injuries in this class?\u201d\n\nGoyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question.\n\n\u201cThat was me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was slashed by a hippogriff.\u201d\n\n\u201cA hippogriff?\u201d said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically.\n\n\u201cOnly because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\nBoth Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cAnother night\u2019s detention, I think,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWell, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that\u2019s all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.\u201d\n\n\u201cJolly good,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle.\n\n\nIt was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge\u2019s office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward him, \u201csoak your hand in that, it\u2019s a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.\u201d\n\nHarry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks\u2019s ears with his left hand.\n\n\u201cI still reckon you should complain about this,\u201d said Ron in a low voice.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry flatly.\n\n\u201cMcGonagall would go nuts if she knew \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, she probably would,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd how long d\u2019you reckon it\u2019d take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?\u201d\n\nRon opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an awful woman,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice. \u201cAwful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we\u2019ve got to do something about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suggested poison,\u201d said Ron grimly.\n\n\u201cNo . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we\u2019re not going to learn any defense from her at all,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, what can we do about that?\u201d said Ron, yawning. \u201c\u2019S too late, isn\u2019t it? She got the job, she\u2019s here to stay, Fudge\u2019ll make sure of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione tentatively. \u201cYou know, I was thinking today . . .\u201d She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, \u201cI was thinking that \u2014 maybe the time\u2019s come when we should just \u2014 just do it ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what ourselves?\u201d said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cCome off it,\u201d groaned Ron. \u201cYou want us to do extra work? D\u2019you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it\u2019s only the second week?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is much more important than homework!\u201d said Hermione.\n\nHarry and Ron goggled at her.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think there was anything in the universe more important than homework,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, of course there is!\u201d said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. \u201cIt\u2019s about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge\u2019s first lesson, for what\u2019s waiting out there. It\u2019s about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don\u2019t learn anything for a whole year \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do much by ourselves,\u201d said Ron in a defeated voice. \u201cI mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I agree, we\u2019ve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we\u2019re going wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Lupin . . .\u201d Harry began.\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not talking about Lupin,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cHe\u2019s too busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that\u2019s not nearly often enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho, then?\u201d said Harry, frowning at her.\n\nHermione heaved a very deep sigh.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about you, Harry.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered.\n\n\u201cAbout me what?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry\u2019s consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, \u201cThat\u2019s an idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s an idea?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d said Ron. \u201cTeaching us to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut . . .\u201d\n\nHarry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not a teacher, I can\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. \u201cNo I\u2019m not, you\u2019ve beaten me in every test \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I haven\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione coolly. \u201cYou beat me in our third year \u2014 the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I\u2019m not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you\u2019ve done!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what, I\u2019m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,\u201d Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. \u201cLet\u2019s think,\u201d he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. \u201cUh . . . first year \u2014 you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that was luck,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat wasn\u2019t skill \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond year,\u201d Ron interrupted, \u201cyou killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but if Fawkes hadn\u2019t turned up I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThird year,\u201d said Ron, louder still, \u201cyou fought off about a hundred dementors at once \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year,\u201d Ron said, almost shouting now, \u201cyou fought off You-Know-Who again \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to me!\u201d said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. \u201cJust listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what I was doing half the time, I didn\u2019t plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help \u2014\u201d\n\nRon and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn\u2019t even sure why he was feeling so angry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d he said heatedly. \u201cI know what went on, all right? And I didn\u2019t get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because \u2014 because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right \u2014 but I just blundered through it all, I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing \u2014 STOP LAUGHING!\u201d\n\nThe bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn\u2019t remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and Hermione\u2019s smiles had vanished.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like! You \u2014 neither of you \u2014 you\u2019ve never had to face him, have you? You think it\u2019s just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you\u2019re in class or something? The whole time you know there\u2019s nothing between you and dying except your own \u2014 your own brain or guts or whatever \u2014 like you can think straight when you know you\u2019re about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die \u2014 they\u2019ve never taught us that in their classes, what it\u2019s like to deal with things like that \u2014 and you two sit there acting like I\u2019m a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up \u2014 you just don\u2019t get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn\u2019t needed me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t saying anything like that, mate,\u201d said Ron, looking aghast. \u201cWe weren\u2019t having a go at Diggory, we didn\u2019t \u2014 you\u2019ve got the wrong end of the \u2014\u201d\n\nHe looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d she said timidly, \u201cdon\u2019t you see? This . . . this is exactly why we need you. . . . We need to know what it\u2019s r-really like . . . facing him . . . facing V-Voldemort.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time she had ever said Voldemort\u2019s name, and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence.\n\n\u201cWell . . . think about it,\u201d said Hermione quietly. \u201cPlease?\u201d\n\nHarry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was agreeing to.\n\nHermione stood up.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m off to bed,\u201d she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it. \u201cErm . . . \u2019night.\u201d\n\nRon had gotten to his feet too.\n\n\u201cComing?\u201d he said awkwardly to Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIn . . . in a minute. I\u2019ll just clear this up.\u201d\n\nHe indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left.\n\n\u201cReparo,\u201d Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl.\n\nHe was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he got to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors, and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter16": "IN THE HOG\u2019S HEAD\n\n\n\n\nHermione made no mention of Harry giving Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion. Harry\u2019s detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched on the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape.\n\n\u201cI was wondering,\u201d Hermione said suddenly, \u201cwhether you\u2019d thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course I have,\u201d said Harry grumpily. \u201cCan\u2019t forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI meant the idea Ron and I had\u201d \u2014 Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look; she frowned at him \u2014 \u201coh, all right, the idea I had, then \u2014 about you teaching us.\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind.\n\nThe fact was that he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters \u2014 found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons. . . .\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said slowly, when he could not pretend to find Asiatic anti-venoms interesting much longer, \u201cyeah, I \u2014 I\u2019ve thought about it a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd?\u201d said Hermione eagerly.\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Harry, playing for time. He looked up at Ron.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a good idea from the start,\u201d said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure that Harry was not going to start shouting again.\n\nHarry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\n\n\u201cYou did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Harry,\u201d said Hermione gently, \u201cbut all the same, there\u2019s no point pretending that you\u2019re not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can\u2019t, Viktor always said \u2014\u201d\n\nRon looked around at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck; rubbing it, he said, \u201cYeah? What did Vicky say?\u201d\n\n\u201cHo ho,\u201d said Hermione in a bored voice. \u201cHe said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn\u2019t, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang.\u201d\n\nRon was looking at Hermione suspiciously.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not still in contact with him, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what if I am?\u201d said Hermione coolly, though her face was a little pink. \u201cI can have a pen pal if I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t only want to be your pen pal,\u201d said Ron accusingly.\n\nHermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, \u201cWell, what do you think? Will you teach us?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust you and Ron, yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione, now looking a mite anxious again. \u201cWell . . . now, don\u2019t fly off the handle again, Harry, please. . . . But I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we\u2019re talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort \u2014 oh, don\u2019t be pathetic, Ron \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem fair if we don\u2019t offer the chance to other people.\u201d\n\nHarry considered this for a moment, then said, \u201cYeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I\u2019m a nutter, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you\u2019ve got to say,\u201d said Hermione seriously. \u201cLook,\u201d she leaned toward him; Ron, who was still watching her with a frown on his face, leaned forward to listen too, \u201cyou know the first weekend in October\u2019s a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who\u2019s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do we have to do it outside school?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, \u201cI don\u2019t think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.\u201d\n\n\nHarry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they did not want him to come \u2014 but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy?\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t blame him for wanting to get out and about,\u201d said Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s been on the run for over two years, hasn\u2019t he, and I know that can\u2019t have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn\u2019t he? And now he\u2019s just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf.\u201d\n\nHermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher.\n\n\u201cThe trouble is,\u201d she said to Harry, \u201cuntil V-Voldemort \u2014 oh for heaven\u2019s sake, Ron \u2014 comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn\u2019t he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn\u2019t going to realize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore\u2019s been telling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again it\u2019ll be obvious Sirius isn\u2019t one . . . I mean, he hasn\u2019t got the Mark, for one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon he\u2019d be stupid enough to turn up,\u201d said Ron bracingly. \u201cDumbledore\u2019d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn\u2019t like what he hears.\u201d\n\nWhen Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, \u201cListen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. We\u2019ve told them to meet us in Hogsmeade.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Harry,\u201d Hermione said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got enough on your plate without Sirius too.\u201d\n\nShe was quite right, of course; he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practices twice a week, Ron also had prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks.\n\nThe morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. After breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn\u2019t been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all.\n\nWhen Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out onto the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 why was Filch sniffing you?\u201d asked Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.\n\n\u201cI suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,\u201d said Harry with a small laugh. \u201cI forgot to tell you . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself.\n\n\u201cHe said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who had tipped him off?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Harry, shrugging. \u201cMaybe Malfoy, he\u2019d think it was a laugh.\u201d\n\nThey walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left onto the road into the village, the wind whipping their hair into their eyes.\n\n\u201cMalfoy?\u201d said Hermione, very skeptically. \u201cWell . . . yes . . . maybe . . .\u201d\n\nAnd she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going anyway?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cThe Three Broomsticks?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 no,\u201d said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, \u201cno, it\u2019s always packed and really noisy. I\u2019ve told the others to meet us in the Hog\u2019s Head, that other pub, you know the one, it\u2019s not on the main road. I think it\u2019s a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don\u2019t normally go in there, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be overheard.\u201d\n\nThey walked down the main street past Zonko\u2019s Joke Shop, where they were unsurprised to see Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture upon it of a wild boar\u2019s severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door.\n\n\u201cWell, come on,\u201d said Hermione slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside.\n\nIt was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog\u2019s Head bar comprised one small, dingy, and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be earthy, though as Harry stepped onto it he realized that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.\n\nHarry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: \u201cYeh get a lot o\u2019 funny folk in the Hog\u2019s Head,\u201d he had said, explaining how he had won a dragon\u2019s egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog\u2019s Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty gray bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth. Two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents; in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about this, Hermione,\u201d Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch. \u201cHas it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?\u201d\n\nHermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure.\n\n\u201cUmbridge is shorter than that woman,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there\u2019s nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I\u2019ve double- and triple-checked the school rules. We\u2019re not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog\u2019s Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I\u2019ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they\u2019re definitely allowed. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea if we parade what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry dryly, \u201cespecially as it\u2019s not exactly a homework group you\u2019re planning, is it?\u201d\n\nThe barman sidled toward them out of a back room. He was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long gray hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he grunted.\n\n\u201cThree butterbeers, please,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThe man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar.\n\n\u201cSix Sickles,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get them,\u201d said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The barman\u2019s eyes traveled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry\u2019s money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry, Ron, and Hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around, while the man in the dirty gray bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman.\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. \u201cWe could order anything we liked in here, I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn\u2019t care. I\u2019ve always wanted to try firewhisky \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 are \u2014 a \u2014 prefect,\u201d snarled Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Ron, the smile fading from his face. \u201cYeah . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?\u201d Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig.\n\n\u201cJust a couple of people,\u201d Hermione repeated, checking her watch and then looking anxiously toward the door. \u201cI told them to be here about now and I\u2019m sure they all know where it is \u2014 oh look, this might be them now \u2014\u201d\n\nThe door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people.\n\nFirst came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry\u2019s stomach did a back flip) Cho and one of her usually giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet, and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, and a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and Terry Boot; Ginny, followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognized vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko\u2019s merchandise.\n\n\u201cA couple of people?\u201d said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. \u201cA couple of people?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,\u201d said Hermione happily. \u201cRon, do you want to pull up some more chairs?\u201d\n\nThe barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly he had never seen his pub so full.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly. \u201cCould we have . . . twenty-five butterbeers, please?\u201d\n\nThe barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar.\n\n\u201cCheers,\u201d said Fred, handing them out. \u201cCough up, everyone, I haven\u2019t got enough gold for all of these . . .\u201d\n\nHarry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat have you been telling people?\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cWhat are they expecting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you, they just want to hear what you\u2019ve got to say,\u201d said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything yet, I\u2019ll speak to them first.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite Harry.\n\nHarry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron\u2019s right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told Harry plainly that, given her way, she would not be here at all.\n\nIn twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron, and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. \u201cWell \u2014 er \u2014 hi.\u201d\n\nThe group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.\n\n\u201cWell . . . erm . . . well, you know why you\u2019re here. Erm . . . well, Harry here had the idea \u2014 I mean\u201d \u2014 Harry had thrown her a sharp look \u2014 \u201cI had the idea \u2014 that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts \u2014 and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us\u201d \u2014 (Hermione\u2019s voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) \u2014 \u201cbecause nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts\u201d \u2014 \u201cHear, hear,\u201d said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened \u2014 \u201cwell, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.\u201d\n\nShe paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, \u201cAnd by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but the real spells \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too though, I bet?\u201d said Michael Corner.\n\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d said Hermione at once. \u201cBut I want more than that, I want to be properly trained in Defense because . . . because . . .\u201d She took a great breath and finished, \u201cBecause Lord Voldemort\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nThe reaction was immediate and predictable. Cho\u2019s friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down herself, Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch, Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry.\n\n\u201cWell . . . that\u2019s the plan anyway,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIf you want to join us, we need to decide how we\u2019re going to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the proof You-Know-Who\u2019s back?\u201d said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice.\n\n\u201cWell, Dumbledore believes it \u2014\u201d Hermione began.\n\n\u201cYou mean, Dumbledore believes him,\u201d said the blond boy, nodding at Harry.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said Ron rather rudely.\n\n\u201cZacharias Smith,\u201d said the boy, \u201cand I think we\u2019ve got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who\u2019s back.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Hermione, intervening swiftly, \u201cthat\u2019s really not what this meeting was supposed to be about \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Hermione,\u201d said Harry.\n\nIt had just dawned upon him why there were so many people there. He felt that Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people \u2014 maybe even most of them \u2014 had turned up in the hope of hearing Harry\u2019s story firsthand.\n\n\u201cWhat makes me say You-Know-Who\u2019s back?\u201d he asked, looking Zacharias straight in the face. \u201cI saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn\u2019t believe him, you don\u2019t believe me, and I\u2019m not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.\u201d\n\nThe whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening in. He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag; it was becoming steadily dirtier.\n\nZacharias said dismissively, \u201cAll Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory\u2019s body back to Hogwarts. He didn\u2019t give us details, he didn\u2019t tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we\u2019d all like to know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can\u2019t help you,\u201d Harry said. His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith\u2019s aggressive face, determined not to look at Cho. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that\u2019s what you\u2019re here for, you might as well clear out.\u201d\n\nHe cast an angry look in Hermione\u2019s direction. This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story was. . . . But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. \u201cSo . . . like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defense, then we need to work out how we\u2019re going to do it, how often we\u2019re going to meet, and where we\u2019re going to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it true,\u201d interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, \u201cthat you can produce a Patronus?\u201d\n\nThere was a murmur of interest around the group at this.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry slightly defensively.\n\n\u201cA corporeal Patronus?\u201d\n\nThe phrase stirred something in Harry\u2019s memory.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 you don\u2019t know Madam Bones, do you?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe girl smiled.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s my auntie,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m Susan Bones. She told me about your hearing. So \u2014 is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cBlimey, Harry!\u201d said Lee, looking deeply impressed. \u201cI never knew that!\u201d\n\n\u201cMum told Ron not to spread it around,\u201d said Fred, grinning at Harry. \u201cShe said you got enough attention as it was.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not wrong,\u201d mumbled Harry and a couple of people laughed. The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.\n\n\u201cAnd did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore\u2019s office?\u201d demanded Terry Boot. \u201cThat\u2019s what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 yeah, I did, yeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\nJustin Finch-Fletchley whistled, the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks, and Lavender Brown said \u201cwow\u201d softly. Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho.\n\n\u201cAnd in our first year,\u201d said Neville to the group at large, \u201che saved that Sorcerous Stone \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSorcerer\u2019s,\u201d hissed Hermione.\n\n\u201cYes, that, from You-Know-Who,\u201d finished Neville.\n\nHannah Abbott\u2019s eyes were as round as Galleons.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not to mention,\u201d said Cho (Harry\u2019s eyes snapped onto her, she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault), \u201call the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year \u2014 getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and things . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. Harry\u2019s insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself. The fact that Cho had just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said and everyone fell silent at once, \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m trying to be modest or anything, but . . . I had a lot of help with all that stuff . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNot with the dragon, you didn\u2019t,\u201d said Michael Corner at once. \u201cThat was a seriously cool bit of flying . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well \u2014\u201d said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree.\n\n\u201cAnd nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer,\u201d said Susan Bones.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cno, okay, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I\u2019m trying to make is \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?\u201d said Zacharias Smith.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s an idea,\u201d said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you shut your mouth?\u201d\n\nPerhaps the word \u201cweasel\u201d had affected Ron particularly strongly; in any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve all turned up to learn from him, and now he\u2019s telling us he can\u2019t really do any of it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what he said,\u201d snarled Fred Weasley.\n\n\u201cWould you like us to clean out your ears for you?\u201d inquired George, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko\u2019s bags.\n\n\u201cOr any part of your body, really, we\u2019re not fussy where we stick this,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cYes, well,\u201d said Hermione hastily, \u201cmoving on . . . the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?\u201d\n\nThere was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in George\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled. \u201cWell, then, the next question is how often we do it. I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point in meeting less than once a week \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Angelina, \u201cwe need to make sure this doesn\u2019t clash with our Quidditch practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Cho, \u201cnor with ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor ours,\u201d added Zacharias Smith.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can find a night that suits everyone,\u201d said Hermione, slightly impatiently, \u201cbut you know, this is rather important, we\u2019re talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell said!\u201d barked Ernie Macmillan, whom Harry had been expecting to speak long before this. \u201cPersonally I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we\u2019ll do this year, even with our O.W.L.s coming up!\u201d\n\nHe looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry, \u201cSurely not!\u201d When nobody spoke, he went on, \u201cI, personally, am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us at this critical period. Obviously they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think the reason Umbridge doesn\u2019t want us trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cis that she\u2019s got some . . . some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army. She thinks he\u2019d mobilize us against the Ministry.\u201d\n\nNearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up, \u201cWell, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information.\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s got an army of heliopaths,\u201d said Luna solemnly.\n\n\u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t,\u201d snapped Hermione.\n\n\u201cYes, he has,\u201d said Luna.\n\n\u201cWhat are heliopaths?\u201d asked Neville, looking blank.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re spirits of fire,\u201d said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever. \u201cGreat tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t exist, Neville,\u201d said Hermione tartly.\n\n\u201cOh yes they do!\u201d said Luna angrily.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but where\u2019s the proof of that?\u201d snapped Hermione.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of eyewitness accounts, just because you\u2019re so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHem, hem,\u201d said Ginny in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. \u201cWeren\u2019t we trying to decide how often we\u2019re going to meet and get Defense lessons?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione at once, \u201cyes, we were, you\u2019re right . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, once a week sounds cool,\u201d said Lee Jordan.\n\n\u201cAs long as \u2014\u201d began Angelina.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,\u201d said Hermione in a tense voice. \u201cWell, the other thing to decide is where we\u2019re going to meet . . .\u201d\n\nThis was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.\n\n\u201cLibrary?\u201d suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cMaybe an unused classroom?\u201d said Dean.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, \u201cMcGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practicing for the Triwizard . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.\n\n\u201cRight, well, we\u2019ll try to find somewhere,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWe\u2019ll send a message round to everybody when we\u2019ve got a time and a place for the first meeting.\u201d\n\nShe rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something.\n\n\u201cI-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,\u201d she took a deep breath, \u201cthat we all ought to agree not to shout about what we\u2019re doing. So if you sign, you\u2019re agreeing not to tell Umbridge \u2014 or anybody else \u2014 what we\u2019re up to.\u201d\n\nFred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully put down his signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list.\n\n\u201cEr . . .\u201d said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass him. \u201cWell . . . I\u2019m sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is.\u201d\n\nBut Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too. Hermione raised her eyebrows at him.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 well, we are prefects,\u201d Ernie burst out. \u201cAnd if this list was found . . . well, I mean to say . . . you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just said this group was the most important thing you\u2019d do this year,\u201d Harry reminded him.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 yes,\u201d said Ernie, \u201cyes, I do believe that, it\u2019s just . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cErnie, do you really think I\u2019d leave that list lying around?\u201d said Hermione testily.\n\n\u201cNo. No, of course not,\u201d said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. \u201cI \u2014 yes, of course I\u2019ll sign.\u201d\n\nNobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho\u2019s friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her name. When the last person \u2014 Zacharias \u2014 had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an odd feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract.\n\n\u201cWell, time\u2019s ticking on,\u201d said Fred briskly, getting to his feet. \u201cGeorge, Lee, and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we\u2019ll be seeing you all later.\u201d\n\nIn twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too. Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide her face, but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that went quite well,\u201d said Hermione happily, as she, Harry, and Ron walked out of the Hog\u2019s Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later, Harry and Ron still clutching their bottles of butterbeer.\n\n\u201cThat Zacharias bloke\u2019s a wart,\u201d said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith just discernible in the distance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like him much either,\u201d admitted Hermione, \u201cbut he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more people the better really \u2014 I mean, Michael Corner and his friends wouldn\u2019t have come if he hadn\u2019t been going out with Ginny \u2014\u201d\n\nRon, who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s WHAT?\u201d said Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef. \u201cShe\u2019s going out with \u2014 my sister\u2019s going \u2014 what d\u2019you mean, Michael Corner?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s why he and his friends came, I think \u2014 well, they\u2019re obviously interested in learning Defense, but if Ginny hadn\u2019t told Michael what was going on \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did this \u2014 when did she \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last year,\u201d said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High Street and she paused outside Scrivenshaft\u2019s Quill Shop, where there was a handsome display of pheasant-feather quills in the window. \u201cHmm . . . I could do with a new quill.\u201d\n\nShe turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her.\n\n\u201cWhich one was Michael Corner?\u201d Ron demanded furiously.\n\n\u201cThe dark one,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like him,\u201d said Ron at once.\n\n\u201cBig surprise,\u201d said Hermione under her breath.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, \u201cI thought Ginny fancied Harry!\u201d\n\nHermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head.\n\n\u201cGinny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago. Not that she doesn\u2019t like you, of course,\u201d she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black-and-gold quill.\n\nHarry, whose head was still full of Cho\u2019s parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why she talks now?\u201d he asked Hermione. \u201cShe never used to talk in front of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cYes, I think I\u2019ll have this one . . .\u201d\n\nShe went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts, Ron still breathing down her neck.\n\n\u201cRon,\u201d she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, \u201cthis is exactly why Ginny hasn\u2019t told you she\u2019s seeing Michael, she knew you\u2019d take it badly. So don\u2019t harp on about it, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, who\u2019s taking anything badly? I\u2019m not going to harp on about anything . . .\u201d\n\nRon continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street. Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, \u201cAnd talking about Michael and Ginny . . . what about Cho and you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\nIt was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold \u2014 had he been that obvious?\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione, smiling slightly, \u201cshe just couldn\u2019t keep her eyes off you, could she?\u201d\n\nHarry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter17": "EDUCATIONAL DECREE NUMBER TWENTY-FOUR\n\n\n\n\nHarry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term. He and Ron spent much of Sunday catching up with all their homework again, and although this could hardly be called fun, the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted, so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room, they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake. Hermione, who of course was up to date with all her work, brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her, producing more hats and scarves.\n\nThe knowledge that they were doing something to resist Umbridge and the Ministry, and that he was a key part of the rebellion, gave Harry a feeling of immense satisfaction. He kept reliving Saturday\u2019s meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done . . . and Cho praising his performance in the Triwizard Tournament. . . . The knowledge that all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on Monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite classes.\n\nHe and Ron headed downstairs from their dormitory together, discussing Angelina\u2019s idea that they were to work on a new move called the Sloth Grip Roll during that night\u2019s Quidditch practice, and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people.\n\nA large sign had been affixed to the Gryffindor notice board, so large that it covered everything else on there \u2014 the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from Argus Filch, the Quidditch team training schedule, the offers to barter certain Chocolate Frog cards for others, the Weasleys\u2019 new advertisement for testers, the dates of the Hogsmeade weekends, and the lost-and-found notices. The new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 BY ORDER OF \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe High Inquisitor of Hogwarts\n\n\n\n\nAll Student Organizations, Societies, Teams, Groups, and Clubs are henceforth disbanded.\n\nAn Organization, Society, Team, Group, or Club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students.\n\nPermission to re-form may be sought from the High Inquisitor (Professor Umbridge).\n\nNo Student Organization, Society, Team, Group, or Club may exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor.\n\n\n\nAny student found to have formed, or to belong to, an Organization, Society, Team, Group, or Club that has not been approved by the High Inquisitor will be expelled.\n\n\n\nThe above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-four.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry and Ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious-looking second years.\n\n\u201cDoes this mean they\u2019re going to shut down the Gobstones Club?\u201d one of them asked his friend.\n\n\u201cI reckon you\u2019ll be okay with Gobstones,\u201d Ron said darkly, making the second year jump. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be as lucky, though, do you?\u201d he asked Harry as the second years hurried away.\n\nHarry was reading the notice through again. The happiness that had filled him since Saturday was gone. His insides were pulsing with rage.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a coincidence,\u201d he said, his hands forming fists. \u201cShe knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t,\u201d said Ron at once.\n\n\u201cThere were people listening in that pub. And let\u2019s face it, we don\u2019t know how many of the people who turned up we can trust. . . . Any of them could have run off and told Umbridge . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he had thought they believed him, thought they even admired him . . .\n\n\u201cZacharias Smith!\u201d said Ron at once, punching a fist into his hand. \u201cOr \u2014 I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look too \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI wonder if Hermione\u2019s seen this yet?\u201d Harry said, looking around at the door to the girls\u2019 dormitories.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go and tell her,\u201d said Ron. He bounded forward, pulled open the door, and set off up the spiral staircase.\n\nHe was on the sixth stair when it happened. There was a loud, wailing, klaxonlike sound and the steps melted together to make a long, smooth stone slide. There was a brief moment when Ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backward and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at Harry\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re allowed in the girls\u2019 dormitories,\u201d said Harry, pulling Ron to his feet and trying not to laugh.\n\nTwo fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.\n\n\u201cOooh, who tried to get upstairs?\u201d they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling Harry and Ron.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d said Ron, who was still rather disheveled. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that would happen. It\u2019s not fair!\u201d he added to Harry, as the girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. \u201cHermione\u2019s allowed in our dormitory, how come we\u2019re not allowed \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s an old-fashioned rule,\u201d said Hermione, who had just slid neatly onto a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet, \u201cbut it says in Hogwarts: A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls. Anyway, why were you trying to get in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see you \u2014 look at this!\u201d said Ron, dragging her over to the notice board.\n\nHermione\u2019s eyes slid rapidly down the notice. Her expression became stony.\n\n\u201cSomeone must have blabbed to her!\u201d Ron said angrily.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t have done,\u201d said Hermione in a low voice.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so naive,\u201d said Ron, \u201cyou think just because you\u2019re all honorable and trustworthy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they can\u2019t have done because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cBelieve me, if anyone\u2019s run off and told Umbridge, we\u2019ll know exactly who they are and they will really regret it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll happen to them?\u201d said Ron eagerly.\n\n\u201cWell, put it this way,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cit\u2019ll make Eloise Midgen\u2019s acne look like a couple of cute freckles. Come on, let\u2019s get down to breakfast and see what the others think. . . . I wonder whether this has been put up in all the Houses?\u201d\n\nIt was immediately apparent on entering the Great Hall that Umbridge\u2019s sign had not only appeared in Gryffindor Tower. There was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the Hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what they had read. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had barely taken their seats when Neville, Dean, Fred, George, and Ginny descended upon them.\n\n\u201cDid you see it?\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you reckon she knows?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\n\nThey were all looking at Harry. He glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it anyway, of course,\u201d he said quietly.\n\n\u201cKnew you\u2019d say that,\u201d said George, beaming and thumping Harry on the arm.\n\n\u201cThe prefects as well?\u201d said Fred, looking quizzically at Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Hermione coolly.\n\n\u201cHere comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott,\u201d said Ron, looking over his shoulder. \u201cAnd those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith . . . and no one looks very spotty.\u201d\n\nHermione looked alarmed.\n\n\u201cNever mind spots, the idiots can\u2019t come over here now, it\u2019ll look really suspicious \u2014 sit down!\u201d she mouthed to Ernie and Hannah, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the Hufflepuff table. \u201cLater! We\u2019ll \u2014 talk \u2014 to \u2014 you \u2014 later!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell Michael,\u201d said Ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her bench. \u201cThe fool, honestly . . .\u201d\n\nShe hurried off toward the Ravenclaw table; Harry watched her go. Cho was sitting not far away, talking to the curly-haired friend she had brought along to the Hog\u2019s Head. Would Umbridge\u2019s notice scare her off meeting them again?\n\nBut the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the Great Hall for History of Magic.\n\n\u201cHarry! Ron!\u201d\n\nIt was Angelina and she was hurrying toward them looking perfectly desperate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Harry quietly, when she was near enough to hear him. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou realize she\u2019s including Quidditch in this?\u201d Angelina said over him. \u201cWe have to go and ask permission to re-form the Gryffindor team!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d said Ron, appalled.\n\n\u201cYou read the sign, it mentions teams too! So listen, Harry . . . I am saying this for the last time. . . . Please, please don\u2019t lose your temper with Umbridge again or she might not let us play anymore!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d said Harry, for Angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll behave myself . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBet Umbridge is in History of Magic,\u201d said Ron grimly, as they set off for Binns\u2019s lesson. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t inspected Binns yet. . . . Bet you anything she\u2019s there . . .\u201d\n\nBut he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was Professor Binns, floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars. Harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring Hermione\u2019s frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nShe pointed at the window. Harry looked around. Hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge, gazing through the thick glass at him, a letter tied to her leg. Harry could not understand it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn\u2019t she delivered the letter then, as usual? Many of his classmates were pointing out Hedwig to each other too.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve always loved that owl, she\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Harry heard Lavender sigh to Parvati.\n\nHe glanced around at Professor Binns who continued to read his notes, serenely unaware that the class\u2019s attention was even less focused upon him than usual. Harry slipped quietly off his chair, crouched down, and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly.\n\nHe had expected Hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the Owlery, but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting dolefully. He closed the window with an anxious glance at Professor Binns, crouched low again, and sped back to his seat with Hedwig on his shoulder. He regained his seat, transferred Hedwig to his lap, and made to remove the letter tied to her leg.\n\nIt was only then that he realized that Hedwig\u2019s feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong way, and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s hurt!\u201d Harry whispered, bending his head low over her. Hermione and Ron leaned in closer; Hermione even put down her quill. \u201cLook \u2014 there\u2019s something wrong with her wing \u2014\u201d\n\nHedwig was quivering; when Harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump, all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself, and gazed at him reproachfully.\n\n\u201cProfessor Binns,\u201d said Harry loudly, and everyone in the class turned to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d\n\nProfessor Binns raised his eyes from his notes, looking amazed, as always, to find the room in front of him full of people.\n\n\u201cNot feeling well?\u201d he repeated hazily.\n\n\u201cNot at all well,\u201d said Harry firmly, getting to his feet while concealing Hedwig behind his back. \u201cSo I think I\u2019ll need to go to the hospital wing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Professor Binns, clearly very much wrong-footed. \u201cYes . . . yes, hospital wing . . . well, off you go, then, Perkins . . .\u201d\n\nOnce outside the room Harry returned Hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor, pausing to think only when he was out of sight of Binns\u2019s door. His first choice of somebody to cure Hedwig would have been Hagrid, of course, but as he had no idea where Hagrid was, his only remaining option was to find Professor Grubbly-Plank and hope she would help.\n\nHe peered out of a window at the blustery, overcast grounds. There was no sign of her anywhere near Hagrid\u2019s cabin; if she was not teaching, she was probably in the staffroom. He set off downstairs, Hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder.\n\nTwo stone gargoyles flanked the staffroom door. As Harry approached, one of them croaked, \u201cYou should be in class, sunny Jim.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is urgent,\u201d said Harry curtly.\n\n\u201cOoooh, urgent, is it?\u201d said the other gargoyle in a high-pitched voice. \u201cWell, that\u2019s put us in our place, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHarry knocked; he heard footsteps and then the door opened and he found himself face-to-face with Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been given another detention!\u201d she said at once, her square spectacles flashing alarmingly.\n\n\u201cNo, Professor!\u201d said Harry hastily.\n\n\u201cWell then, why are you out of class?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s urgent, apparently,\u201d said the second gargoyle snidely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cIt\u2019s my owl, she\u2019s injured.\u201d\n\n\u201cInjured owl, did you say?\u201d\n\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank appeared at Professor McGonagall\u2019s shoulder, smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the Daily Prophet.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, lifting Hedwig carefully off his shoulder, \u201cshe turned up after the other post owls and her wing\u2019s all funny, look \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took Hedwig from Harry while Professor McGonagall watched.\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank, her pipe waggling slightly as she talked. \u201cLooks like something\u2019s attacked her. Can\u2019t think what would have done it, though. . . . Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid\u2019s got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls . . .\u201d\n\nHarry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right. Professor McGonagall, however, looked sharply at Harry and said, \u201cDo you know how far this owl\u2019s traveled, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry. \u201cFrom London, I think.\u201d\n\nHe met her eyes briefly and knew that she understood \u201cLondon\u201d to mean \u201cnumber twelve, Grimmauld Place\u201d by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle.\n\nProfessor Grubbly-Plank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye to examine Hedwig\u2019s wing closely. \u201cI should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me, Potter,\u201d she said. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be flying long distances for a few days, in any case.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 right \u2014 thanks,\u201d said Harry, just as the bell rang for break.\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Professor Grubbly-Plank gruffly, turning back into the staffroom.\n\n\u201cJust a moment, Wilhelmina!\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cPotter\u2019s letter!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d said Harry, who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to Hedwig\u2019s leg. Professor Grubbly-Plank handed it over and then disappeared into the staffroom carrying Hedwig, who was staring at Harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this. Feeling slightly guilty, he turned to go, but Professor McGonagall called him back.\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Professor?\u201d\n\nShe glanced up and down the corridor; there were students coming from both directions.\n\n\u201cBear in mind,\u201d she said quickly and quietly, her eyes on the scroll in his hand, \u201cthat channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014\u201d said Harry, but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him. Professor McGonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staffroom, leaving Harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd. Here he spotted Ron and Hermione already standing in a sheltered corner, their cloak collars turned up against the wind. Harry slit open the scroll as he hurried toward them and found five words in Sirius\u2019s handwriting:\n\n\n\nToday, same time, same place.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs Hedwig okay?\u201d asked Hermione anxiously, the moment he was within earshot.\n\n\u201cWhere did you take her?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cTo Grubbly-Plank,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd I met McGonagall . . . Listen . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he told them what Professor McGonagall had said. To his surprise, neither of the others looked shocked; on the contrary, they exchanged significant looks.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, looking from Ron to Hermione and back again.\n\n\u201cWell, I was just saying to Ron . . . what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig? I mean, she\u2019s never been hurt on a flight before, has she?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the letter from anyway?\u201d asked Ron, taking the note from Harry.\n\n\u201cSnuffles,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\n\u201c\u2018Same time, same place\u2019? Does he mean the fire in the common room?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d said Hermione, also reading the note. She looked uneasy. \u201cI just hope nobody else has read this . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it was still sealed and everything,\u201d said Harry, trying to convince himself as much as her. \u201cAnd nobody would understand what it meant if they didn\u2019t know where we\u2019d spoken to him before, would they?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hermione anxiously, hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by magic. . . . And if anyone\u2019s watching the Floo Network . . . but I don\u2019t really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too!\u201d\n\nThey trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for Potions, all three of them lost in thought, but as they reached the bottom of the stairs they were recalled to themselves by the voice of Draco Malfoy, who was standing just outside Snape\u2019s classroom door, waving around an official-looking piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word.\n\n\u201cYeah, Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway, I went to ask her first thing this morning. Well, it was pretty much automatic, I mean, she knows my father really well, he\u2019s always popping in and out of the Ministry. . . . It\u2019ll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rise,\u201d Hermione whispered imploringly to Harry and Ron, who were both watching Malfoy, faces set and fists clenched. \u201cIt\u2019s what he wants . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, his gray eyes glittering malevolently in Harry and Ron\u2019s direction, \u201cif it\u2019s a question of influence with the Ministry, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got much chance. . . . From what my father says, they\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years. . . . And as for Potter . . . My father says it\u2019s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo\u2019s. . . . apparently they\u2019ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic . . .\u201d\n\nMalfoy made a grotesque face, his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling. Crabbe and Goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter, Pansy Parkinson shrieked with glee.\n\nSomething collided hard with Harry\u2019s shoulder, knocking him sideways. A split second later he realized that Neville had just charged past him, heading straight for Malfoy.\n\n\u201cNeville, no!\u201d\n\nHarry leapt forward and seized the back of Neville\u2019s robes; Neville struggled frantically, his fists flailing, trying desperately to get at Malfoy who looked, for a moment, extremely shocked.\n\n\u201cHelp me!\u201d Harry flung at Ron, managing to get an arm around Neville\u2019s neck and dragging him backward, away from the Slytherins. Crabbe and Goyle were now flexing their arms, closing in front of Malfoy, ready for the fight. Ron hurried forward and seized Neville\u2019s arms; together, he and Harry succeeded in dragging Neville back into the Gryffindor line. Neville\u2019s face was scarlet; the pressure Harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible, but odd words spluttered from his mouth.\n\n\u201cNot . . . funny . . . don\u2019t . . . Mungo\u2019s . . . show . . . him . . .\u201d\n\nThe dungeon door opened. Snape appeared there. His black eyes swept up the Gryffindor line to the point where Harry and Ron were wrestling with Neville.\n\n\u201cFighting, Potter, Weasley, Longbottom?\u201d Snape said in his cold, sneering voice. \u201cTen points from Gryffindor. Release Longbottom, Potter, or it will be detention. Inside, all of you.\u201d\n\nHarry let go of Neville, who stood panting and glaring at him.\n\n\u201cI had to stop you,\u201d Harry gasped, picking up his bag. \u201cCrabbe and Goyle would\u2019ve torn you apart.\u201d\n\nNeville said nothing, he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon.\n\n\u201cWhat in the name of Merlin,\u201d said Ron slowly, as they followed Neville, \u201cwas that about?\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer. He knew exactly why the subject of people who were in St. Mungo\u2019s because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to Neville, but he had sworn to Dumbledore that he would not tell anyone Neville\u2019s secret. Even Neville did not know that Harry knew.\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class and pulled out parchment, quills, and their copies of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi. The class around them was whispering about what Neville had just done, but when Snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang everybody fell silent immediately.\n\n\u201cYou will notice,\u201d said Snape in his low, sneering voice, \u201cthat we have a guest with us today.\u201d\n\nHe gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon, and Harry saw Professor Umbridge sitting there, clipboard on her knee. He glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione, his eyebrows raised. Snape and Umbridge, the two teachers he hated most . . . it was hard to decide which he wanted to triumph over the other.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing with our Strengthening Solutions today, you will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson, if correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend \u2014 instructions\u201d \u2014 he waved his wand again \u2014 \u201con the board. Carry on.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner. Harry was very interested in hearing her question Snape, so interested, that he was becoming careless with his potion again.\n\n\u201cSalamander blood, Harry!\u201d Hermione moaned, grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time. \u201cNot pomegranate juice!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry vaguely, putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner. Umbridge had just gotten to her feet. \u201cHa,\u201d he said softly, as she strode between two lines of desks toward Snape, who was bending over Dean Thomas\u2019s cauldron.\n\n\u201cWell, the class seems fairly advanced for their level,\u201d she said briskly to Snape\u2019s back. \u201cThough I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus.\u201d\n\nSnape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her.\n\n\u201cNow . . . how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\u201d she asked, her quill poised over her clipboard.\n\n\u201cFourteen years,\u201d Snape replied. His expression was unfathomable. His eyes on Snape, Harry added a few drops to his potion; it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange.\n\n\u201cYou applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?\u201d Professor Umbridge asked Snape.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Snape quietly.\n\n\u201cBut you were unsuccessful?\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s lip curled.\n\n\u201cObviously.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard.\n\n\u201cAnd you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school, I believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Snape quietly, barely moving his lips. He looked very angry.\n\n\u201cDo you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you?\u201d asked Umbridge.\n\n\u201cI suggest you ask him,\u201d said Snape jerkily.\n\n\u201cOh I shall,\u201d said Professor Umbridge with a sweet smile.\n\n\u201cI suppose this is relevant?\u201d Snape asked, his black eyes narrowed.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Professor Umbridge. \u201cYes, the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers\u2019 \u2014 er \u2014 backgrounds . . .\u201d\n\nShe turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and their eyes met for a second. Harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion, which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber.\n\n\u201cNo marks again, then, Potter,\u201d said Snape maliciously, emptying Harry\u2019s cauldron with a wave of his wand. \u201cYou will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry furiously. Snape had already given them homework, and he had Quidditch practice this evening; this would mean another couple of sleepless nights. It did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy. All he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll skive off Divination,\u201d he said glumly as they stood again in the courtyard after lunch, the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats. \u201cI\u2019ll pretend to be ill and do Snape\u2019s essay instead, then I won\u2019t have to stay up half the night . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t skive off Divination,\u201d said Hermione severely.\n\n\u201cHark who\u2019s talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney!\u201d said Ron indignantly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate her,\u201d said Hermione loftily. \u201cI just think she\u2019s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. . . . But Harry\u2019s already missed History of Magic and I don\u2019t think he ought to miss anything else today!\u201d\n\nThere was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, over-perfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom feeling angry at everybody. Professor Trelawney was handing out copies of The Dream Oracle yet again; he would surely be much better employed doing Snape\u2019s punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of made-up dreams.\n\nIt seemed, however, that he was not the only person in Divination who was in a temper. Professor Trelawney slammed a copy of the Oracle down on the table between Harry and Ron and swept away, her lips pursed; she threw the next copy of the Oracle at Seamus and Dean, narrowly avoiding Seamus\u2019s head, and thrust the final one into Neville\u2019s chest with such force that he slipped off his pouf.\n\n\u201cWell, carry on!\u201d said Professor Trelawney loudly, her voice high pitched and somewhat hysterical. \u201cYou know what to do! Or am I such a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?\u201d\n\nThe class stared perplexedly at her and then at each other. Harry, however, thought he knew what was the matter. As Professor Trelawney flounced back to the high-backed teacher\u2019s chair, her magnified eyes full of angry tears, he leaned his head closer to Ron\u2019s and muttered, \u201cI think she\u2019s got the results of her inspection back.\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor?\u201d said Parvati Patil in a hushed voice (she and Lavender had always rather admired Professor Trelawney). \u201cProfessor, is there anything \u2014 er \u2014 wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong!\u201d cried Professor Trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion. \u201cCertainly not! I have been insulted, certainly. . . . Insinuations have been made against me. . . . Unfounded accusations levelled . . . but no, there is nothing wrong, certainly not . . .\u201d\n\nShe took a great shuddering breath and looked away from Parvati, angry tears spilling from under her glasses.\n\n\u201cI say nothing,\u201d she choked, \u201cof sixteen years\u2019 devoted service. . . . It has passed, apparently, unnoticed. . . . But I shall not be insulted, no, I shall not!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Professor, who\u2019s insulting you?\u201d asked Parvati timidly.\n\n\u201cThe establishment!\u201d said Professor Trelawney in a deep, dramatic, wavering voice. \u201cYes, those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know . . . Of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted. . . . It is \u2014 alas \u2014 our fate . . .\u201d\n\nShe gulped, dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl, and then pulled a small, embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve, into which she blew her nose very hard with a sound like Peeves blowing a raspberry. Ron sniggered. Lavender shot him a disgusted look.\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d said Parvati, \u201cdo you mean . . . is it something Professor Umbridge . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not speak to me about that woman!\u201d cried Professor Trelawney, leaping to her feet, her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing. \u201cKindly continue with your work!\u201d\n\nAnd she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them, tears still leaking from behind her glasses, muttering what sounded like threats under her breath.\n\n\u201c . . . may well choose to leave . . . the indignity of it . . . on probation . . . we shall see . . . how she dares . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and Umbridge have got something in common,\u201d Harry told Hermione quietly when they met again in Defense Against the Dark Arts. \u201cShe obviously reckons Trelawney\u2019s an old fraud too. . . . Looks like she\u2019s put her on probation.\u201d\n\nUmbridge entered the room as he spoke, wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, class.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Professor Umbridge,\u201d they chanted drearily.\n\n\u201cWands away, please . . .\u201d\n\nBut there was no answering flurry of movement this time; nobody had bothered to take out their wands.\n\n\u201cPlease turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter, entitled \u2018The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack.\u2019 There will be \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 no need to talk,\u201d Harry, Ron, and Hermione said together under their breaths.\n\n\n\u201cNo Quidditch practice,\u201d said Angelina in hollow tones when Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the common room that night after dinner.\n\n\u201cBut I kept my temper!\u201d said Harry, horrified. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to her, Angelina, I swear, I \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d said Angelina miserably. \u201cShe just said she needed a bit of time to consider.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider what?\u201d said Ron angrily. \u201cShe\u2019s given the Slytherins permission, why not us?\u201d\n\nBut Harry could imagine how much Umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no Gryffindor Quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione, \u201clook on the bright side \u2014 at least now you\u2019ll have time to do Snape\u2019s essay!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bright side, is it?\u201d snapped Harry, while Ron stared incredulously at Hermione. \u201cNo Quidditch practice and extra Potions?\u201d\n\nHarry slumped down into a chair, dragged his Potions essay reluctantly from his bag, and set to work.\n\nIt was very hard to concentrate; even though he knew that Sirius was not due in the fire until much later he could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case. There was also an incredible amount of noise in the room: Fred and George appeared finally to have perfected one type of Skiving Snackbox, which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd.\n\nFirst, Fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew, at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them. Then he would force down the purple end of the chew, at which the vomiting would immediately cease. Lee Jordan, who was assisting the demonstration, was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same Vanishing Spell Snape kept using on Harry\u2019s potions.\n\nWhat with the regular sounds of retching, cheering, and Fred and George taking advance orders from the crowd, Harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for Strengthening Solutions. Hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and sound of vomit hitting the bottom of Fred and George\u2019s bucket were punctuated by loud and disapproving sniffs that Harry found, if anything, more distracting.\n\n\u201cJust go and stop them, then!\u201d he said irritably, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, they\u2019re not technically doing anything wrong,\u201d said Hermione through gritted teeth. \u201cThey\u2019re quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves, and I can\u2019t find a rule that says the other idiots aren\u2019t entitled to buy them, not unless they\u2019re proven to be dangerous in some way, and it doesn\u2019t look as though they are . . .\u201d\n\nShe, Harry, and Ron watched George projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the chew, and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause.\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t get why Fred and George only got three O.W.L.s each,\u201d said Harry, watching as Fred, George, and Lee collected gold from the eager crowd. \u201cThey really know their stuff . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they only know flashy stuff that\u2019s no real use to anyone,\u201d said Hermione disparagingly.\n\n\u201cNo real use?\u201d said Ron in a strained voice. \u201cHermione, they\u2019ve got about twenty-six Galleons already . . .\u201d\n\nIt was a long while before the crowd around the Weasleys dispersed, and then Fred, Lee, and George sat up counting their takings even longer, so that it was well past midnight when Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally had the common room to themselves again. At long last, Fred closed the doorway to the boys\u2019 dormitories behind him, rattling his box of Galleons ostentatiously so that Hermione scowled. Harry, who was making very little progress with his Potions essay, decided to give it up for the night. As he put his books away, Ron, who was dozing lightly in an armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, looked blearily into the fire and said, \u201cSirius!\u201d\n\nHarry whipped around; Sirius\u2019s untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said, grinning.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d chorused Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all three kneeling down upon the hearthrug. Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to Sirius\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re things?\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cNot that good,\u201d said Harry, as Hermione pulled Crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers. \u201cThe Ministry\u2019s forced through another decree, which means we\u2019re not allowed to have Quidditch teams \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups?\u201d said Sirius.\n\nThere was a short pause.\n\n\u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d Harry demanded.\n\n\u201cYou want to choose your meeting places more carefully,\u201d said Sirius, grinning still more broadly. \u201cThe Hog\u2019s Head, I ask you . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it was better than the Three Broomsticks!\u201d said Hermione defensively. \u201cThat\u2019s always packed with people \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 which means you\u2019d have been harder to overhear,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot to learn, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho overheard us?\u201d Harry demanded.\n\n\u201cMundungus, of course,\u201d said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed. \u201cHe was the witch under the veil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was Mundungus?\u201d Harry said, stunned. \u201cWhat was he doing in the Hog\u2019s Head?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think he was doing?\u201d said Sirius impatiently. \u201cKeeping an eye on you, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still being followed?\u201d asked Harry angrily.\n\n\u201cYeah, you are,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cand just as well, isn\u2019t it, if the first thing you\u2019re going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal defense group.\u201d\n\nBut he looked neither angry nor worried; on the contrary, he was looking at Harry with distinct pride.\n\n\u201cWhy was Dung hiding from us?\u201d asked Ron, sounding disappointed. \u201cWe\u2019d\u2019ve liked to\u2019ve seen him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was banned from the Hog\u2019s Head twenty years ago,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cand that barman\u2019s got a long memory. We lost Moody\u2019s spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested, so Dung\u2019s been dressing as a witch a lot lately. . . . Anyway . . . First of all, Ron \u2014 I\u2019ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d said Ron, sounding apprehensive.\n\n\u201cShe says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defense Against the Dark Arts group. She says you\u2019ll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined. She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now. She also\u201d \u2014 Sirius\u2019s eyes turned to the other two \u2014 \u201cadvises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart. She would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you\u2019d all have been in real trouble, and she can\u2019t say it for herself because she\u2019s on duty tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn duty doing what?\u201d said Ron quickly.\n\n\u201cNever you mind, just stuff for the Order,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cSo it\u2019s fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it all on, because I don\u2019t think she trusts me to.\u201d\n\nThere was another pause in which Crookshanks, mewing, attempted to paw Sirius\u2019s head, and Ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug.\n\n\u201cSo you want me to say I\u2019m not going to take part in the defense group?\u201d he muttered finally.\n\n\u201cMe? Certainly not!\u201d said Sirius, looking surprised. \u201cI think it\u2019s an excellent idea!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do?\u201d said Harry, his heart lifting.\n\n\u201cOf course I do!\u201d said Sirius. \u201cD\u2019you think your father and I would\u2019ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you, Harry!\u201d said Sirius impatiently. \u201cThis year we know that there\u2019s someone outside Hogwarts who\u2019d like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if we do get expelled?\u201d Hermione asked, a quizzical look on her face.\n\n\u201cHermione, this whole thing was your idea!\u201d said Harry, staring at her.\n\n\u201cI know it was. . . . I just wondered what Sirius thought,\u201d she said, shrugging.\n\n\u201cWell, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cHear, hear,\u201d said Harry and Ron enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Sirius, \u201chow are you organizing this group? Where are you meeting?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit of a problem now,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDunno where we\u2019re going to be able to go . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about the Shrieking Shack?\u201d suggested Sirius.\n\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s an idea!\u201d said Ron excitedly, but Hermione made a skeptical noise and all three of them looked at her, Sirius\u2019s head turning in the flames.\n\n\u201cWell, Sirius, it\u2019s just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cand all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you\u2019d wanted to. But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn\u2019t need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFair point,\u201d said Sirius, looking slightly crestfallen. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll come up with somewhere. . . . There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor, you might have enough space to practice jinxes in there \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFred and George told me it\u2019s blocked,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head. \u201cCaved in or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . .\u201d said Sirius, frowning. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll have a think and get back to \u2014\u201d\n\nHe broke off. His face was suddenly tense, alarmed. He turned sideways, apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace.\n\n\u201cSirius?\u201d said Harry anxiously.\n\nBut he had vanished. Harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhy did he \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire.\n\nA hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings. . . .\n\nThe three of them ran for it; at the door of the boys\u2019 dormitory Harry looked back. Umbridge\u2019s hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius\u2019s hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter18": "DUMBLEDORE\u2019S ARMY\n\n\n\n\nUmbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There\u2019s no other explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?\u201d he said, outraged.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost certain of it,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cWatch your frog, it\u2019s escaping.\u201d\n\nHarry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully toward the other side of the table \u2014 \u201cAccio!\u201d \u2014 and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.\n\nCharms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat: There was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron, and Hermione\u2019s whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cI mean, once your letter had been read, it would have been quite clear you weren\u2019t ordering them, so you wouldn\u2019t have been in trouble at all \u2014 it\u2019s a bit of a feeble joke, isn\u2019t it? But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it \u2014 tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it \u2014 I don\u2019t think Filch would object, when\u2019s he ever stuck up for a student\u2019s rights? Harry, you\u2019re squashing your frog.\u201d\n\nHarry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he replaced it hastily upon the desk.\n\n\u201cIt was a very, very close call last night,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio!\u201d\n\nThe bullfrog on which she was practicing her Silencing Charm was struck dumb mid-croak and glared at her reproachfully.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019d caught Snuffles . . .\u201d\n\nHarry finished the sentence for her.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d probably be back in Azkaban this morning.\u201d He waved his wand without really concentrating; his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a high-pitched whistle.\n\n\u201cSilencio!\u201d said Hermione hastily, pointing her wand at Harry\u2019s frog, which deflated silently before them. \u201cWell, he mustn\u2019t do it again, that\u2019s all. I just don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to let him know. We can\u2019t send him an owl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t reckon he\u2019ll risk it again,\u201d said Ron. \u201cHe\u2019s not stupid, he knows she nearly got him. Silencio!\u201d\n\nThe large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw.\n\n\u201cSilencio! SILENCIO!\u201d\n\nThe raven cawed more loudly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way you\u2019re moving your wand,\u201d said Hermione, watching Ron critically. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wave it, it\u2019s more a sharp jab.\u201d\n\n\u201cRavens are harder than frogs,\u201d said Ron testily.\n\n\u201cFine, let\u2019s swap,\u201d said Hermione, seizing Ron\u2019s raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog. \u201cSilencio!\u201d The raven continued to open and close its sharp beak, but no sound came out.\n\n\u201cVery good, Miss Granger!\u201d said Professor Flitwick\u2019s squeaky little voice and Harry, Ron, and Hermione all jumped. \u201cNow, let me see you try, Mr. Weasley!\u201d\n\n\u201cWha \u2014 ? Oh \u2014 oh, right,\u201d said Ron, very flustered. \u201cEr \u2014 Silencio!\u201d\n\nHe jabbed at the bullfrog so hard that he poked it in the eye; the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk.\n\nIt came as no surprise to any of them that Harry and Ron were given additional practice of the Silencing Charm for homework.\n\nThey were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside. They found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which Peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier, occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody\u2019s head. They had barely sat down when Angelina came struggling toward them through the groups of gossiping students.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got permission!\u201d she said. \u201cTo re-form the Quidditch team!\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d said Ron and Harry together.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Angelina, beaming. \u201cI went to McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to Dumbledore \u2014 anyway, Umbridge had to give in. Ha! So I want you down at the pitch at seven o\u2019clock tonight, all right, because we\u2019ve got to make up time, you realize we\u2019re only three weeks away from our first match?\u201d\n\nShe squeezed away from them, narrowly dodged an ink pellet from Peeves, which hit a nearby first year instead, and vanished from sight.\n\nRon\u2019s smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window, which was now opaque with hammering rain.\n\n\u201cHope this clears up . . . What\u2019s up with you, Hermione?\u201d\n\nShe too was gazing at the window, but not as though she really saw it. Her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face.\n\n\u201cJust thinking . . .\u201d she said, still frowning at the rain-washed window.\n\n\u201cAbout Siri . . . Snuffles?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo . . . not exactly . . .\u201d said Hermione slowly. \u201cMore . . . wondering . . . I suppose we\u2019re doing the right thing . . . I think . . . aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron looked at each other.\n\n\u201cWell, that clears that up,\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been really annoying if you hadn\u2019t explained yourself properly.\u201d\n\nHermione looked at him as though she had only just realized he was there.\n\n\u201cI was just wondering,\u201d she said, her voice stronger now, \u201cwhether we\u2019re doing the right thing, starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts group.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d said Harry and Ron together.\n\n\u201cHermione, it was your idea in the first place!\u201d said Ron indignantly.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Hermione, twisting her fingers together. \u201cBut after talking to Snuffles . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s all for it!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione, staring at the window again. \u201cYes, that\u2019s what made me think maybe it wasn\u2019t a good idea after all . . .\u201d\n\nPeeves floated over them on his stomach, peashooter at the ready; automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this straight,\u201d said Harry angrily, as they put their bags back on the floor, \u201cSirius agrees with us, so you don\u2019t think we should do it anymore?\u201d\n\nHermione looked tense and rather miserable. Now staring at her own hands she said, \u201cDo you honestly trust his judgment?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I do!\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cHe\u2019s always given us great advice!\u201d\n\nAn ink pellet whizzed past them, striking Katie Bell squarely in the ear. Hermione watched Katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at Peeves; it was a few moments before Hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think he has become . . . sort of . . . reckless . . . since he\u2019s been cooped up in Grimmauld Place? You don\u2019t think he\u2019s . . . kind of . . . living through us?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, \u2018living through us\u2019?\u201d Harry retorted.\n\n\u201cI mean . . . well, I think he\u2019d love to be forming secret defense societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry. . . . I think he\u2019s really frustrated at how little he can do where he is . . . so I think he\u2019s keen to kind of . . . egg us on.\u201d\n\nRon looked utterly perplexed.\n\n\u201cSirius is right,\u201d he said, \u201cyou do sound just like my mother.\u201d\n\nHermione bit her lip and did not answer. The bell rang just as Peeves swooped down upon Katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her head.\n\n\nThe weather did not improve as the day wore on, so that at seven o\u2019clock that evening, when Harry and Ron went down to the Quidditch pitch for practice, they were soaked through within minutes, their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass. The sky was a deep, thundery gray and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms, even if they knew the respite was only temporary. They found Fred and George debating whether to use one of their own Skiving Snackboxes to get out of flying.\n\n\u201c\u2014 but I bet she\u2019d know what we\u2019d done,\u201d Fred said out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cIf only I hadn\u2019t offered to sell her some Puking Pastilles yesterday \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could try the Fever Fudge,\u201d George muttered, \u201cno one\u2019s seen that yet \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it work?\u201d inquired Ron hopefully, as the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building.\n\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d said Fred, \u201cyour temperature\u2019ll go right up \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 but you get these massive pus-filled boils too,\u201d said George, \u201cand we haven\u2019t worked out how to get rid of them yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see any boils,\u201d said Ron, staring at the twins.\n\n\u201cNo, well, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Fred darkly, \u201cthey\u2019re not in a place we generally display to the public \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, everyone, listen up,\u201d said Angelina loudly, emerging from the Captain\u2019s office. \u201cI know it\u2019s not ideal weather, but there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it\u2019s a good idea to work out how we\u2019re going to cope with them. Harry, didn\u2019t you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm?\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione did it,\u201d said Harry. He pulled out his wand, tapped his glasses and said, \u201cImpervius!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all ought to try that,\u201d said Angelina. \u201cIf we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility \u2014 all together, come on \u2014 Impervius! Okay. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThey all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes, shouldered their brooms, and followed Angelina out of the changing rooms.\n\nThey squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch; visibility was still very poor even with the Impervius Charm; light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds.\n\n\u201cAll right, on my whistle,\u201d shouted Angelina.\n\nHarry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upward, the wind pulling him slightly off course. He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately Angelina did not see this; in fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything; none of them had a clue what the others were doing. The wind was picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding sounds of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake.\n\nAngelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat. She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though without any real conviction in her voice. Fred and George were looking particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged and winced with every movement. Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he toweled his hair dry.\n\n\u201cI think a few of mine have ruptured,\u201d said Fred in a hollow voice.\n\n\u201cMine haven\u2019t,\u201d said George, wincing. \u201cThey\u2019re throbbing like mad . . . feel bigger if anything . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOUCH!\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe pressed the towel to his face, his eyes screwed tight with pain. The scar on his forehead had seared again, more painfully than in months.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said several voices.\n\nHarry emerged from behind his towel; the changing room was blurred because he was not wearing his glasses; but he could still tell that everyone\u2019s face was turned toward him.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI \u2014 poked myself in the eye, that\u2019s all . . .\u201d\n\nBut he gave Ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed back outside, muffled in their cloaks, their hats pulled low over their ears.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d said Ron, the moment that Alicia had disappeared through the door. \u201cWas it your scar?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cBut . . .\u201d Looking scared, Ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain, \u201cHe \u2014 he can\u2019t be near us now, can he?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry muttered, sinking onto a bench and rubbing his forehead. \u201cHe\u2019s probably miles away. It hurt because . . . he\u2019s . . . angry.\u201d\n\nHarry had not meant to say that at all, and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken them \u2014 yet he knew at once that they were true. He did not know how he knew it, but he did; Voldemort, wherever he was, whatever he was doing, was in a towering temper.\n\n\u201cDid you see him?\u201d said Ron, looking horrified. \u201cDid you . . . get a vision, or something?\u201d\n\nHarry sat quite still, staring at his feet, allowing his mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain. . . .\n\nA confused tangle of shapes, a howling rush of voices . . .\n\n\u201cHe wants something done, and it\u2019s not happening fast enough,\u201d he said.\n\nAgain, he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth, and yet quite certain that they were true.\n\n\u201cBut . . . how do you know?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHarry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands, pressing down upon them with his palms. Little stars erupted in them. He felt Ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew Ron was staring at him.\n\n\u201cIs this what it was about last time?\u201d said Ron in a hushed voice. \u201cWhen your scar hurt in Umbridge\u2019s office? You-Know-Who was angry?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d\n\nHarry was thinking himself back. He had been looking into Umbridge\u2019s face. . . . His scar had hurt . . . and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach . . . a strange, leaping feeling . . . a happy feeling. . . . But, of course, he had not recognized it for what it was, as he had been feeling so miserable himself. . . .\n\n\u201cLast time, it was because he was pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cReally pleased. He thought . . . something good was going to happen. And the night before we came back to Hogwarts . . .\u201d He thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and Ron\u2019s bedroom in Grimmauld Place. \u201cHe was furious . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked around at Ron, who was gaping at him.\n\n\u201cYou could take over from Trelawney, mate,\u201d he said in an awed voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making prophecies,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNo, you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Ron said, sounding both scared and impressed. \u201cHarry, you\u2019re reading You-Know-Who\u2019s mind. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more like . . . his mood, I suppose. I\u2019m just getting flashes of what mood he\u2019s in. . . . Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year. . . . He said that when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could tell. Well, now I\u2019m feeling it when he\u2019s pleased too . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. The wind and rain lashed at the building.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to tell someone,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI told Sirius last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, tell him about this time!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t, can I?\u201d said Harry grimly. \u201cUmbridge is watching the owls and the fires, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, Dumbledore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just told you, he already knows,\u201d said Harry shortly, getting to his feet, taking his cloak off his peg, and swinging it around himself. \u201cThere\u2019s no point telling him again.\u201d\n\nRon did up the fastening of his own cloak, watching Harry thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019d want to know,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry shrugged.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon . . . we\u2019ve still got Silencing Charms to practice . . .\u201d\n\nThey hurried back through the dark grounds, sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawns, not talking. Harry was thinking hard. What was it that Voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got other plans . . . plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed . . . stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn\u2019t have last time.\u201d\n\nHe had not thought about those words in weeks; he had been too absorbed in what was going on at Hogwarts, too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with Umbridge, the injustice of all the Ministry interference. . . . But now they came back to him and made him wonder. . . . Voldemort\u2019s anger would make sense if he was no nearer laying hands on the weapon, whatever it was. . . . Had the Order thwarted him, stopped him from seizing it? Where was it kept? Who had it now?\n\n\u201cMimbulus mimbletonia,\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice and Harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room.\n\nIt appeared that Hermione had gone to bed early, leaving Crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly, knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire. Harry was rather grateful that she was not around because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to Dumbledore too. Ron kept throwing him anxious glances, but Harry pulled out his Potions book and set to work to finish his essay, though he was only pretending to concentrate and, by the time that Ron said he was going to bed too, had written hardly anything.\n\nMidnight came and went while Harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of scurvy-grass, lovage, and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it. . . .\n\nThese plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts, where the wizard is desirous of producing hot-headedness and recklessness. . . .\n\n. . . Hermione said Sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in Grimmauld Place. . . .\n\n. . . moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine, and are therefore much used . . .\n\n. . . the Daily Prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they found out that he knew what Voldemort was feeling . . .\n\n. . . therefore much used in Confusing and Befuddlement Draughts . . .\n\n. . . confusing was the word, all right; why did he know what Voldemort was feeling? What was this weird connection between them, which Dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily?\n\n. . . where the wizard is desirous . . .\n\n. . . how he would like to sleep . . .\n\n. . . of producing hot-headedness . . .\n\n. . . It was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire, with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes and Crookshanks purring and the crackling of the flames. . . .\n\nThe book slipped from Harry\u2019s slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug. His head fell sideways. . . .\n\nHe was walking once more along a windowless corridor, his footsteps echoing in the silence. As the door at the end of the passage loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement. . . . If he could only open it . . . enter beyond . . .\n\nHe stretched out his hand. . . . His fingertips were inches from it. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, sir!\u201d\n\nHe awoke with a start. The candles had all been extinguished in the common room, but there was something moving close by.\n\n\u201cWhozair?\u201d said Harry, sitting upright in his chair. The fire was almost extinguished, the room very dark.\n\n\u201cDobby has your owl, sir!\u201d said a squeaky voice.\n\n\u201cDobby?\u201d said Harry thickly, peering through the gloom toward the source of the voice.\n\nDobby the house-elf was standing beside the table on which Hermione had left her half a dozen knitted hats. His large, pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats that Hermione had ever knitted; he was wearing one on top of the other, so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet, and on the very topmost bobble sat Hedwig, hooting serenely and obviously cured.\n\n\u201cDobby volunteered to return Harry Potter\u2019s owl!\u201d said the elf squeakily, with a look of positive adoration on his face. \u201cProfessor Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now, sir!\u201d\n\nHe sank into a deep bow so that his pencil-like nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and Hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered onto the arm of Harry\u2019s chair.\n\n\u201cThanks, Dobby!\u201d said Harry, stroking Hedwig\u2019s head and blinking hard, trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream. . . . It had been very vivid. . . . Looking back at Dobby, he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks, so that his feet looked far too big for his body.\n\n\u201cEr . . . have you been taking all the clothes Hermione\u2019s been leaving out?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, sir,\u201d said Dobby happily, \u201cDobby has been taking some for Winky too, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, how is Winky?\u201d asked Harry.\n\nDobby\u2019s ears drooped slightly.\n\n\u201cWinky is still drinking lots, sir,\u201d he said sadly, his enormous round green eyes, large as tennis balls, downcast. \u201cShe still does not care for clothes, Harry Potter. Nor do the other house-elves. None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore, not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere, they finds them insulting, sir. Dobby does it all himself, sir, but Dobby does not mind, sir, for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight, sir, he has got his wish!\u201d Dobby sank into a deep bow again. \u201cBut Harry Potter does not seem happy,\u201d Dobby went on, straightening up again and looking timidly at Harry. \u201cDobby heard him muttering in his sleep. Was Harry Potter having bad dreams?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really bad,\u201d said Harry, yawning and rubbing his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d\n\nThe elf surveyed Harry out of his vast, orblike eyes. Then he said very seriously, his ears drooping, \u201cDobby wishes he could help Harry Potter, for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much, much happier now . . .\u201d\n\nHarry smiled.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help me, Dobby, but thanks for the offer . . .\u201d\n\nHe bent and picked up his Potions book. He\u2019d have to try and finish the essay tomorrow. He closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his hand \u2014 the result of his detention with Umbridge.\n\n\u201cWait a moment \u2014 there is something you can do for me, Dobby,\u201d said Harry slowly.\n\nThe elf looked around, beaming.\n\n\u201cName it, Harry Potter, sir!\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers. Especially,\u201d Harry clenched his hand on the book, so that the scars shone pearly white, \u201cProfessor Umbridge.\u201d\n\nHe expected the elf\u2019s smile to vanish, his ears to droop; he expected him to say that this was impossible, or else that he would try, but his hopes were not high. . . . What he had not expected was for Dobby to give a little skip, his ears waggling happily, and clap his hands together.\n\n\u201cDobby knows the perfect place, sir!\u201d he said happily. \u201cDobby heard tell of it from the other house-elves when he came to Hogwarts, sir. It is known by us as the Come and Go Room, sir, or else as the Room of Requirement!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry curiously.\n\n\u201cBecause it is a room that a person can only enter,\u201d said Dobby seriously, \u201cwhen they have real need of it. Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker\u2019s needs. Dobby has used it, sir,\u201d said the elf, dropping his voice and looking guilty, \u201cwhen Winky has been very drunk. He has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off, sir. . . . And Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short, sir, and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and if you really needed a bathroom,\u201d said Harry, suddenly remembering something Dumbledore had said at the Yule Ball the previous Christmas, \u201cwould it fill itself with chamber pots?\u201d\n\n\u201cDobby expects so, sir,\u201d said Dobby, nodding earnestly. \u201cIt is a most amazing room, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many people know about it?\u201d said Harry, sitting up straighter in his chair.\n\n\u201cVery few, sir. Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, sir, but often they never finds it again, for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds brilliant,\u201d said Harry, his heart racing. \u201cIt sounds perfect, Dobby. When can you show me where it is?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime, Harry Potter, sir,\u201d said Dobby, looking delighted at Harry\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cWe could go now, if you like!\u201d\n\nFor a moment Harry was tempted to go now; he was halfway out of his seat, intending to hurry upstairs for his Invisibility Cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like Hermione\u2019s whispered in his ear: reckless. It was, after all, very late, and he was exhausted.\n\n\u201cNot tonight, Dobby,\u201d said Harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair. \u201cThis is really important. . . . I don\u2019t want to blow it, it\u2019ll need proper planning. . . . Listen, can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is and how to get in there?\u201d\n\n\nTheir robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double Herbology, where they could hardly hear what Professor Sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. The afternoon\u2019s Care of Magical Creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-swept grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and, to their intense relief, Angelina sought out her team at lunch to tell them that Quidditch practice was canceled.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Harry quietly, when she told him, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve found somewhere to have our first Defense meeting. Tonight, eight o\u2019clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?\u201d\n\nShe looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others; Harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash. When he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found Hermione watching him.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said thickly.\n\n\u201cWell . . . it\u2019s just that Dobby\u2019s plans aren\u2019t always that safe. Don\u2019t you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis room isn\u2019t just some mad idea of Dobby\u2019s; Dumbledore knows about it too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s expression cleared.\n\n\u201cDumbledore told you about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust in passing,\u201d said Harry, shrugging.\n\n\u201cOh well, that\u2019s all right then,\u201d said Hermione briskly and she raised no more objections.\n\nTogether with Ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the Hog\u2019s Head and telling them where to meet that evening. Somewhat to Harry\u2019s disappointment, it was Ginny who managed to find Cho Chang and her friend first; however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twenty-five people who had turned up in the Hog\u2019s Head.\n\nAt half-past seven Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the Gryffindor common room, Harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand. Fifth years were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine o\u2019clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way up to the seventh floor.\n\n\u201cHold it,\u201d said Harry warningly, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping it with his wand, and muttering, \u201cI solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\u201d\n\nA map of Hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parchment. Tiny black moving dots, labeled with names, showed where various people were.\n\n\u201cFilch is on the second floor,\u201d said Harry, holding the map close to his eyes and scanning it closely, \u201cand Mrs. Norris is on the fourth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Umbridge?\u201d said Hermione anxiously.\n\n\u201cIn her office,\u201d said Harry, pointing. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nThey hurried along the corridor to the place Dobby had described to Harry, a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting Barnabas the Barmy\u2019s foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the would-be ballet teacher to watch. \u201cDobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need.\u201d\n\nThey did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-size vase on its other side. Ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration, Hermione was whispering something under her breath, Harry\u2019s fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him.\n\nWe need somewhere to learn to fight. . . . he thought. Just give us a place to practice . . . somewhere they can\u2019t find us . . .\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past.\n\nA highly polished door had appeared in the wall. Ron was staring at it, looking slightly wary. Harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door, and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below.\n\nThe walls were lined with wooden bookcases, and instead of chairs there were large silk cushions on the floor. A set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors, and a large, cracked Foe-Glass that Harry was sure had hung, the previous year, in the fake Moody\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThese will be good when we\u2019re practicing Stunning,\u201d said Ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot.\n\n\u201cAnd just look at these books!\u201d said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the large leather-bound tomes. \u201cA Compendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark Arts Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . .\u201d She looked around at Harry, her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced Hermione that what they were doing was right. \u201cHarry, this is wonderful, there\u2019s everything we need here!\u201d\n\nAnd without further ado she slid Jinxes for the Jinxed from its shelf, sank onto the nearest cushion, and began to read.\n\nThere was a gentle knock on the door. Harry looked around; Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati, and Dean had arrived.\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d said Dean, staring around, impressed. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d\n\nHarry began to explain, but before he had finished more people had arrived, and he had to start all over again. By the time eight o\u2019clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. Harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent, looking at him. Hermione carefully marked her page of Jinxes for the Jinxed and set the book aside.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry, slightly nervously. \u201cThis is the place we\u2019ve found for practices, and you\u2019ve \u2014 er \u2014 obviously found it okay \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic!\u201d said Cho, and several people murmured their agreement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bizarre,\u201d said Fred, frowning around at it. \u201cWe once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard then . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, Harry, what\u2019s this stuff?\u201d asked Dean from the rear of the room, indicating the Sneakoscopes and the Foe-Glass.\n\n\u201cDark Detectors,\u201d said Harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them. \u201cBasically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around, but you don\u2019t want to rely on them too much, they can be fooled . . .\u201d\n\nHe gazed for a moment into the cracked Foe-Glass; shadowy figures were moving around inside it, though none was recognizable. He turned his back on it.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and \u2014 er \u2014\u201d He noticed a raised hand. \u201cWhat, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we ought to elect a leader,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s leader,\u201d said Cho at once, looking at Hermione as though she were mad, and Harry\u2019s stomach did yet another back flip.\n\n\u201cYes, but I think we ought to vote on it properly,\u201d said Hermione, unperturbed. \u201cIt makes it formal and it gives him authority. So \u2014 everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader?\u201d\n\nEverybody put up their hands, even Zacharias Smith, though he did it very halfheartedly.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 right, thanks,\u201d said Harry, who could feel his face burning. \u201cAnd \u2014 what, Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cI also think we ought to have a name,\u201d she said brightly, her hand still in the air. \u201cIt would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we be the Anti-Umbridge League?\u201d said Angelina hopefully.\n\n\u201cOr the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group?\u201d suggested Fred.\n\n\u201cI was thinking,\u201d said Hermione, frowning at Fred, \u201cmore of a name that didn\u2019t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Defense Association?\u201d said Cho. \u201cThe D.A. for short, so nobody knows what we\u2019re talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, the D.A.\u2019s good,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cOnly let\u2019s make it stand for Dumbledore\u2019s Army because that\u2019s the Ministry\u2019s worst fear, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThere was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this.\n\n\u201cAll in favor of the D.A.?\u201d said Hermione bossily, kneeling up on her cushion to count. \u201cThat\u2019s a majority \u2014 motion passed!\u201d\n\nShe pinned the piece of paper with all of their names on it on the wall and wrote DUMBLEDORE\u2019S ARMY across the top in large letters.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, when she had sat down again, \u201cshall we get practicing then? I was thinking, the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus, you know, the Disarming Charm. I know it\u2019s pretty basic but I\u2019ve found it really useful \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh please,\u201d said Zacharias Smith, rolling his eyes and folding his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You-Know-Who, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve used it against him,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cIt saved my life last June.\u201d\n\nSmith opened his mouth stupidly. The rest of the room was very quiet.\n\n\u201cBut if you think it\u2019s beneath you, you can leave,\u201d Harry said.\n\nSmith did not move. Nor did anybody else.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, his mouth slightly drier than usual with all those eyes upon him, \u201cI reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice.\u201d\n\nIt felt very odd to be issuing instructions, but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed. Everybody got to their feet at once and divided up. Predictably, Neville was left partnerless.\n\n\u201cYou can practice with me,\u201d Harry told him. \u201cRight \u2014 on the count of three, then \u2014 one, two, three \u2014\u201d\n\nThe room was suddenly full of shouts of \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d: Wands flew in all directions, missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks, and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backward a few paces or wince as the feeble spell whooshed over them.\n\n\u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d said Neville, and Harry, caught unawares, felt his wand fly out of his hand.\n\n\u201cI DID IT!\u201d said Neville gleefully. \u201cI\u2019ve never done it before \u2014 I DID IT!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood one!\u201d said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel situation Neville\u2019s opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. \u201cListen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?\u201d\n\nHarry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith; every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far for the solution of the mystery, however; Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.\n\n\u201cSorry, Harry,\u201d said George hastily, when Harry caught his eye. \u201cCouldn\u2019t resist . . .\u201d\n\nHarry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them. Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchley\u2019s wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end.\n\n\u201cOkay, stop!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cStop! STOP!\u201d\n\nI need a whistle, he thought, and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books. He caught it up and blew hard. Everyone lowered their wands.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t bad,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut there\u2019s definite room for improvement.\u201d Zacharias Smith glared at him. \u201cLet\u2019s try again . . .\u201d\n\nHe moved off around the room again, stopping here and there to make suggestions. Slowly the general performance improved. He avoided going near Cho and her friend for a while, but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Cho rather wildly as he approached. \u201cExpelliarmious! I mean, Expellimellius! I \u2014 oh, sorry, Marietta!\u201d\n\nHer curly-haired friend\u2019s sleeve had caught fire; Marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at Harry as though it was his fault.\n\n\u201cYou made me nervous, I was doing all right before then!\u201d Cho told Harry ruefully.\n\n\u201cThat was quite good,\u201d Harry lied, but when she raised her eyebrows he said, \u201cWell, no, it was lousy, but I know you can do it properly, I was watching from over there . . .\u201d\n\nShe laughed. Her friend Marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind her,\u201d Cho muttered. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really want to be here but I made her come with me. Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset Umbridge, you see \u2014 her mum works for the Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge too,\u201d said Cho, drawing herself up proudly. \u201cBut if they think I\u2019m not going to fight You-Know-Who after what happened to Cedric \u2014\u201d\n\nShe broke off, looking rather confused, and an awkward silence fell between them; Terry Boot\u2019s wand went whizzing past Harry\u2019s ear and hit Alicia Spinnet hard on the nose.\n\n\u201cWell, my father is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action!\u201d said Luna Lovegood proudly from just behind Harry; evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while Justin Finch-Fletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head. \u201cHe\u2019s always saying he\u2019d believe anything of Fudge, I mean, the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated! And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he feeds secretly to anybody who disagrees with him. And then there\u2019s his Umgubular Slashkilter \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d Harry muttered to Cho as she opened her mouth, looking puzzled. She giggled.\n\n\u201cHey, Harry,\u201d Hermione called from the other end of the room, \u201chave you checked the time?\u201d\n\nHe looked down at his watch and received a shock \u2014 it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out-of-bounds. He blew his whistle; everybody stopped shouting, \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor.\n\n\u201cWell, that was pretty good,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut we\u2019ve overrun, we\u2019d better leave it here. Same time, same place next week?\u201d\n\n\u201cSooner!\u201d said Dean Thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement.\n\nAngelina, however, said quickly, \u201cThe Quidditch season\u2019s about to start, we need team practices too!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say next Wednesday night, then,\u201d said Harry, \u201cand we can decide on additional meetings then. . . . Come on, we\u2019d better get going . . .\u201d\n\nHe pulled out the Marauder\u2019s Map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor. He let them all leave in threes and fours, watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories: the Hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens, the Ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle, and the Gryffindors along the corridor to the seventh floor and the Fat Lady\u2019s portrait.\n\n\u201cThat was really, really good, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, when finally it was just her, Harry, and Ron left.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was!\u201d said Ron enthusiastically, as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them. \u201cDid you see me disarm Hermione, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly once,\u201d said Hermione, stung. \u201cI got you loads more than you got me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not only get you once, I got you at least three times \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand \u2014\u201d\n\nThey argued all the way back to the common room, but Harry was not listening to them. He had one eye on the Marauder\u2019s Map, but he was also thinking of how Cho had said he made her nervous. . . ."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter19": "THE LION AND THE SERPENT\n\n\n\n\nHarry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two weeks, a glowing secret that supported him through Umbridge\u2019s classes and even made it possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging eyes. He and the D.A. were resisting her under her very nose, doing the very thing that she and the Ministry most feared, and whenever he was supposed to be reading Wilbert Slinkhard\u2019s book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings, remembering how Neville had successfully disarmed Hermione, how Colin Creevey had mastered the Impediment Jinx after three meetings\u2019 hard effort, how Parvati Patil had produced such a good Reductor Curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the Sneakoscopes to dust.\n\nHe was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for D.A. meetings, as they had to accommodate three separate Quidditch teams\u2019 practices, which were often rearranged depending on the weather conditions; but Harry was not sorry about this, he had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable. If anyone was watching them, it would be hard to make out a pattern.\n\nHermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice, because it would look so suspicious if people from different Houses were seen crossing the Great Hall to talk to each other too often. She gave each of the members of the D.A. a fake Galleon (Ron became very excited when he saw the basket at first, convinced that she was actually giving out gold).\n\n\u201cYou see the numerals around the edge of the coins?\u201d Hermione said, holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting. The coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches. \u201cOn real Galleons that\u2019s just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. The coins will grow hot when the date changes, so if you\u2019re carrying them in a pocket you\u2019ll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he\u2019ll change the numbers on his coin, and because I\u2019ve put a Protean Charm on them, they\u2019ll all change to mimic his.\u201d\n\nA blank silence greeted Hermione\u2019s words. She looked around at all the faces upturned to her, rather disconcerted.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 I thought it was a good idea,\u201d she said uncertainly, \u201cI mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there\u2019s nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But . . . well, if you don\u2019t want to use them . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do a Protean Charm?\u201d said Terry Boot.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s . . . that\u2019s N.E.W.T. standard, that is,\u201d he said weakly.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Hermione, trying to look modest. \u201cOh . . . well . . . yes, I suppose it is . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re not in Ravenclaw?\u201d he demanded, staring at Hermione with something close to wonder. \u201cWith brains like yours?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting,\u201d said Hermione brightly, \u201cbut it decided on Gryffindor in the end. So does that mean we\u2019re using the Galleons?\u201d\n\nThere was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to collect one from the basket. Harry looked sideways at Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou know what these remind me of?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, what\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Death Eaters\u2019 scars. Voldemort touches one of them, and all their scars burn, and they know they\u2019ve got to join him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . yes,\u201d said Hermione quietly. \u201cThat is where I got the idea . . . but you\u2019ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members\u2019 skin . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . I prefer your way,\u201d said Harry, grinning, as he slipped his Galleon into his pocket. \u201cI suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFat chance,\u201d said Ron, who was examining his own fake Galleon with a slightly mournful air. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any real Galleons to confuse it with.\u201d\n\nAs the first Quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, drew nearer, their D.A. meetings were put on hold because Angelina insisted on almost daily practices. The fact that the Quidditch Cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome, for they, of course, would be playing both teams over the coming year; and the Heads of House of the competing teams, though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsmanship, were determined to see their side\u2019s victory. Harry realized how much Professor McGonagall cared about beating Slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got enough to be getting on with at the moment,\u201d she said loftily. Nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at Harry and Ron and said grimly, \u201cI\u2019ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study, boys, and I really don\u2019t want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape, so use the extra time to practice, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nSnape was no less obviously partisan: He had booked the Quidditch pitch for Slytherin practice so often that the Gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play. He was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of Slytherin attempts to hex Gryffindor players in the corridors. When Alicia Spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth, Snape insisted that she must have attempted a Hair-Thickening Charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitnesses who insisted that they had seen the Slytherin Keeper, Miles Bletchley, hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library.\n\nHarry felt optimistic about Gryffindor\u2019s chances; they had, after all, never lost to Malfoy\u2019s team. Admittedly Ron was still not performing to Wood\u2019s standard, but he was working extremely hard to improve. His greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence when he made a blunder; if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more. On the other hand, Harry had seen Ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form: During one memorable practice, he had hung one-handed from his broom and kicked the Quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end. The rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by Barry Ryan, the Irish International Keeper, against Poland\u2019s top Chaser, Ladislaw Zamojski. Even Fred had said that Ron might yet make him and George proud, and that they were seriously considering admitting that he was related to them, something he assured Ron they had been trying to deny for four years.\n\nThe only thing really worrying Harry was how much Ron was allowing the tactics of the Slytherin team to upset him before they even got onto the pitch. Harry, of course, had endured their snide comments for more than four years, so whispers of, \u201cHey, Potty, I heard Warrington\u2019s sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday,\u201d far from chilling his blood, made him laugh. \u201cWarrington\u2019s aim\u2019s so pathetic I\u2019d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me,\u201d he retorted, which made Ron and Hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off Pansy Parkinson\u2019s face.\n\nBut Ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults, jeers, and intimidation. When Slytherins, some of them seventh years and considerably larger than he was, muttered as they passed in the corridors, \u201cGot your bed booked in the hospital wing, Weasley?\u201d he did not laugh, but turned a delicate shade of green. When Draco Malfoy imitated Ron dropping the Quaffle (which he did whenever they were within sight of each other), Ron\u2019s ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too.\n\nOctober extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and November arrived, cold as frozen iron, with hard frosts every morning and icy drafts that bit at exposed hands and faces. The skies and the ceiling of the Great Hall turned a pale, pearly gray, the mountains around Hogwarts became snowcapped, and the temperature in the castle dropped so far that many students wore their thick protective dragon skin gloves in the corridors between lessons.\n\nThe morning of the match dawned bright and cold. When Harry awoke he looked around at Ron\u2019s bed and saw him sitting bolt upright, his arms around his knees, staring fixedly into space.\n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d said Harry.\n\nRon nodded but did not speak. Harry was reminded forcibly of the time that Ron had accidentally put a slug-vomiting charm on himself. He looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then, not to mention as reluctant to open his mouth.\n\n\u201cYou just need some breakfast,\u201d Harry said bracingly. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nThe Great Hall was filling up fast when they arrived, the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than usual. As they passed the Slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise; Harry looked around and saw that nearly everyone there was wearing, in addition to the usual green-and-silver scarves and hats, silver badges in the shape of what seemed to be crowns. For some reason many of them waved at Ron, laughing uproariously. Harry tried to see what was written on the badges as he walked by, but he was too concerned to get Ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them.\n\nThey received a rousing welcome at the Gryffindor table, where everyone was wearing red and gold, but far from raising Ron\u2019s spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale; he collapsed onto the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal.\n\n\u201cI must\u2019ve been mental to do this,\u201d he said in a croaky whisper. \u201cMental.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be thick,\u201d said Harry firmly, passing him a choice of cereals. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine. It\u2019s normal to be nervous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rubbish,\u201d croaked Ron. \u201cI\u2019m lousy. I can\u2019t play to save my life. What was I thinking?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet a grip,\u201d said Harry sternly. \u201cLook at that save you made with your foot the other day, even Fred and George said it was brilliant \u2014\u201d\n\nRon turned a tortured face to Harry.\n\n\u201cThat was an accident,\u201d he whispered miserably. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it \u2014 I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry, recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise, \u201ca few more accidents like that and the game\u2019s in the bag, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing red-and-gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d Ginny asked Ron, who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just nervous,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good sign, I never feel you perform as well in exams if you\u2019re not a bit nervous,\u201d said Hermione heartily.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them. Harry looked up: Luna Lovegood had drifted over from the Ravenclaw table. Many people were staring at her and a few openly laughing and pointing; she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion\u2019s head, which was perched precariously on her head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supporting Gryffindor,\u201d said Luna, pointing unnecessarily at her hat. \u201cLook what it does . . .\u201d\n\nShe reached up and tapped the hat with her wand. It opened its mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Luna happily. \u201cI wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin, you know, but there wasn\u2019t time. Anyway . . . good luck, Ronald!\u201d\n\nShe drifted away. They had not quite recovered from the shock of Luna\u2019s hat before Angelina came hurrying toward them, accompanied by Katie and Alicia, whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by Madam Pomfrey.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to go straight down to the pitch, check out conditions and change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in a bit,\u201d Harry assured her. \u201cRon\u2019s just got to have some breakfast.\u201d\n\nIt became clear after ten minutes, however, that Ron was not capable of eating anything more and Harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms. As they rose from the table, Hermione got up too, and taking Harry\u2019s arm, she drew him to one side.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let Ron see what\u2019s on those Slytherins\u2019 badges,\u201d she whispered urgently.\n\nHarry looked questioningly at her, but she shook her head warningly; Ron had just ambled over to them, looking lost and desperate.\n\n\u201cGood luck, Ron,\u201d said Hermione, standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek. \u201cAnd you, Harry \u2014\u201d\n\nRon seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the Great Hall. He touched the spot on his face where Hermione had kissed him, looking puzzled, as though he was not quite sure what had just happened. He seemed too distracted to notice much around him, but Harry cast a curious glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the words etched onto them:\n\n\n\n\n\nWith an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good, he hurried Ron across the entrance hall, down the stone steps, and out into the icy air.\n\nThe frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns toward the stadium. There was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white, which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes. Harry pointed out these encouraging factors to Ron as they walked, but he was not sure that Ron was listening.\n\nAngelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered. Harry and Ron pulled on their robes (Ron attempted to do his up back-to-front for several minutes before Alicia took pity on him and went to help) and then sat down to listen to the pre-match talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch.\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve only just found out the final lineup for Slytherin,\u201d said Angelina, consulting a piece of parchment. \u201cLast year\u2019s Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left now, but it looks as though Montague\u2019s replaced them with the usual gorillas, rather than anyone who can fly particularly well. They\u2019re two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle, I don\u2019t know much about them \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do,\u201d said Harry and Ron together.\n\n\u201cWell, they don\u2019t look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from another,\u201d said Angelina, pocketing her parchment, \u201cbut then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way onto the pitch without signposts.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrabbe and Goyle are in the same mold,\u201d Harry assured her.\n\nThey could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators\u2019 stands now. Some people were singing, though Harry could not make out the words. He was starting to feel nervous, but he knew his butterflies were as nothing to Ron\u2019s, who was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again, his jaw set and his complexion pale gray.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said Angelina in a hushed voice, looking at her watch. \u201cC\u2019mon everyone . . . good luck.\u201d\n\nThe team rose, shouldered their brooms, and marched in single file out of the changing room and into the dazzling sky. A roar of sound greeted them in which Harry could still hear singing, though it was muffled by the cheers and whistles.\n\nThe Slytherin team were standing waiting for them. They too were wearing those silver crown-shaped badges. The new captain, Montague, was built along the same lines as Dudley, with massive forearms like hairy hams. Behind him lurked Crabbe and Goyle, almost as large, blinking stupidly, swinging their new Beaters\u2019 bats. Malfoy stood to one side, the sunlight gleaming on his white-blond head. He caught Harry\u2019s eye and smirked, tapping the crown-shaped badge on his chest.\n\n\u201cCaptains shake hands,\u201d ordered the umpire, Madam Hooch, as Angelina and Montague reached each other. Harry could tell that Montague was trying to crush Angelina\u2019s fingers, though she did not wince. \u201cMount your brooms . . .\u201d\n\nMadam Hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew.\n\nThe balls were released and the fourteen players shot upward; out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron streak off toward the goal hoops. He zoomed higher, dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other side of the stadium, Draco Malfoy was doing exactly the same.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s Johnson, Johnson with the Quaffle, what a player that girl is, I\u2019ve been saying it for years but she still won\u2019t go out with me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cJORDAN!\u201d yelled Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cJust a fun fact, Professor, adds a bit of interest \u2014 and she\u2019s ducked Warrington, she\u2019s passed Montague, she\u2019s \u2014 ouch \u2014 been hit from behind by a Bludger from Crabbe. . . . Montague catches the Quaffle, Montague heading back up the pitch and \u2014 nice Bludger there from George Weasley, that\u2019s a Bludger to the head for Montague, he drops the Quaffle, caught by Katie Bell, Katie Bell of Gryffindor reverse passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet\u2019s away \u2014\u201d\n\nLee Jordan\u2019s commentary rang through the stadium and Harry listened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and the din of the crowd, all yelling and booing and singing \u2014\n\n\u201c\u2014 dodges Warrington, avoids a Bludger \u2014 close call, Alicia \u2014 and the crowd are loving this, just listen to them, what\u2019s that they\u2019re singing?\u201d\n\nAnd as Lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the Slytherin section of the stands:\n\n\n\nWeasley cannot save a thing,\n\nHe cannot block a single ring,\n\nThat\u2019s why Slytherins all sing:\n\nWeasley is our King.\n\n\n\nWeasley was born in a bin,\n\nHe always lets the Quaffle in,\n\nWeasley will make sure we win,\n\nWeasley is our King.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2014 and Alicia passes back to Angelina!\u201d Lee shouted, and as Harry swerved, his insides boiling at what he had just heard, he knew Lee was trying to drown out the sound of the singing. \u201cCome on now, Angelina \u2014 looks like she\u2019s got just the Keeper to beat! \u2014 SHE SHOOTS \u2014 SHE \u2014 aaaah . . .\u201d\n\nBletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; he threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer Ron \u2014\n\n\n\nWeasley is our King,\n\nWeasley is our King,\n\nHe always lets the Quaffle in,\n\nWeasley is our King.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry could not help himself: Abandoning his search for the Snitch, he turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a lone figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington pelted toward him . . .\n\n\u201c\u2014 and it\u2019s Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington heading for goal, he\u2019s out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead \u2014\u201d\n\nA great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands below:\n\n\n\nWeasley cannot save a thing,\n\nHe cannot block a single ring . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2014 so it\u2019s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the team \u2014 come on, Ron!\u201d\n\nBut the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end: Ron had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the Quaffle had soared between them, straight through Ron\u2019s central hoop.\n\n\u201cSlytherin score!\u201d came Lee\u2019s voice amid the cheering and booing from the crowds below. \u201cSo that\u2019s ten-nil to Slytherin \u2014 bad luck, Ron . . .\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins sang even louder:\n\n\n\nWEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN,\n\nHE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2014 and Gryffindor back in possession and it\u2019s Katie Bell tanking up the pitch \u2014\u201d cried Lee valiantly, though the singing was now so deafening that he could hardly make himself heard above it.\n\n\n\nWEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN,\n\nWEASLEY IS OUR KING . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\u201d screamed Angelina, soaring past him to keep up with Katie. \u201cGET GOING!\u201d\n\nHarry realized that he had been stationary in midair for more than a minute, watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch; horrified, he went into a dive and started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium:\n\n\n\nWEASLEY IS OUR KING,\n\nWEASLEY IS OUR KING . . .\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked; Malfoy was still circling the stadium just like Harry. They passed midway around the pitch going in opposite directions and Harry heard Malfoy singing loudly,\n\n\n\nWEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2014 and it\u2019s Warrington again,\u201d bellowed Lee, \u201cwho passes to Pucey, Pucey\u2019s off past Spinnet, come on now Angelina, you can take him \u2014 turns out you can\u2019t \u2014 but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley, I mean, George Weasley, oh who cares, one of them anyway, and Warrington drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell \u2014 er \u2014 drops it too \u2014 so that\u2019s Montague with the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Montague takes the Quaffle, and he\u2019s off up the pitch, come on now Gryffindor, block him!\u201d\n\nHarry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the Slytherin goal hoops, willing himself not to look at what was going on at Ron\u2019s end; as he sped past the Slytherin Keeper, he heard Bletchley singing along with the crowd below,\n\n\n\nWEASLEY CANNOT SAVE A THING . . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2014 and Pucey\u2019s dodged Alicia again, and he\u2019s heading straight for goal, stop it, Ron!\u201d\n\nHarry did not have to look to see what had happened: There was a terrible groan from the Gryffindor end, coupled with fresh screams and applause from the Slytherins. Looking down, Harry saw the pug-faced Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her back to the pitch as she conducted the Slytherin supporters who were roaring:\n\n\n\nTHAT\u2019S WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING:\n\nWEASLEY IS OUR KING.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut twenty\u2013nil was nothing, there was still time for Gryffindor to catch up or catch the Snitch, a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual, Harry assured himself, bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be Montague\u2019s watch strap. . . .\n\nBut Ron let in two more goals. There was an edge of panic in Harry\u2019s desire to find the Snitch now. If he could just get it soon and finish the game quickly . . .\n\n\u201c\u2014 and Katie Bell of Gryffindor dodges Pucey, ducks Montague, nice swerve, Katie, and she throws to Johnson, Angelina Johnson takes the Quaffle, she\u2019s past Warrington, she\u2019s heading for goal, come on now Angelina \u2014 GRYFFINDOR SCORE! It\u2019s forty\u2013ten, forty\u2013ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle . . .\u201d\n\nHarry could hear Luna\u2019s ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the Gryffindor cheers and felt heartened; only thirty points in it, that was nothing, they could pull back easily. Harry ducked a Bludger that Crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic scouring of the pitch for the Snitch, keeping one eye on Malfoy in case he showed signs of having spotted it, but Malfoy, like him, was continuing to soar around the stadium, searching fruitlessly . . .\n\n\u201c\u2014 Pucey throws to Warrington, Warrington to Montague, Montague back to Pucey \u2014 Johnson intervenes, Johnson takes the Quaffle, Johnson to Bell, this looks good \u2014 I mean bad \u2014 Bell\u2019s hit by a Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin and it\u2019s Pucey in possession again . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nWEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN,\n\nHE ALWAYS LETS THE QUAFFLE IN,\n\nWEASLEY WILL MAKE SURE WE WIN \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Harry had seen it at last: The tiny fluttering Golden Snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the Slytherin end of the pitch.\n\nHe dived. . . .\n\nIn a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of the sky on Harry\u2019s left, a green-and-silver blur lying flat on his broom. . . .\n\nThe Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops and scooted off toward the other side of the stands; its change of direction suited Malfoy, who was nearer. Harry pulled his Firebolt around, he and Malfoy were now neck and neck . . .\n\nFeet from the ground, Harry lifted his right hand from his broom, stretching toward the Snitch . . . to his right, Malfoy\u2019s arm extended too, reaching, groping . . .\n\nIt was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept seconds \u2014 Harry\u2019s fingers closed around the tiny, struggling ball \u2014 Malfoy\u2019s fingernails scrabbled the back of Harry\u2019s hand hopelessly \u2014 Harry pulled his broom upward, holding the struggling ball in his hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their approval. . . .\n\nThey were saved, it did not matter that Ron had let in those goals, nobody would remember as long as Gryffindor had won \u2014\n\nWHAM!\n\nA Bludger hit Harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew forward off his broom; luckily he was only five or six feet above the ground, having dived so low to catch the Snitch, but he was winded all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch. He heard Madam Hooch\u2019s shrill whistle, an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls, angry yells and jeering, a thud, then Angelina\u2019s frantic voice.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course I am,\u201d said Harry grimly, taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet. Madam Hooch was zooming toward one of the Slytherin players above him, though he could not see who it was at this angle.\n\n\u201cIt was that thug, Crabbe,\u201d said Angelina angrily. \u201cHe whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you\u2019d got the Snitch \u2014 but we won, Harry, we won!\u201d\n\nHarry heard a snort from behind him and turned around, still holding the Snitch tightly in his hand: Draco Malfoy had landed close by; white-faced with fury, he was still managing to sneer.\n\n\u201cSaved Weasley\u2019s neck, haven\u2019t you?\u201d he said to Harry. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a worse Keeper . . . but then he was born in a bin. . . . Did you like my lyrics, Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer; he turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one, yelling and punching the air in triumph, all except Ron, who had dismounted from his broom over by the goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to write another couple of verses!\u201d Malfoy called, as Katie and Alicia hugged Harry. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t find rhymes for fat and ugly \u2014 we wanted to sing about his mother, see \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk about sour grapes,\u201d said Angelina, casting Malfoy a disgusted look.\n\n\u201c\u2014 we couldn\u2019t fit in useless loser either \u2014 for his father, you know \u2014\u201d\n\nFred and George had realized what Malfoy was talking about. Halfway through shaking Harry\u2019s hand they stiffened, looking around at Malfoy.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d said Angelina at once, taking Fred by the arm. \u201cLeave it, Fred, let him yell, he\u2019s just sore he lost, the jumped-up little \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 but you like the Weasleys, don\u2019t you, Potter?\u201d said Malfoy, sneering. \u201cSpend holidays there and everything, don\u2019t you? Can\u2019t see how you stand the stink, but I suppose when you\u2019ve been dragged up by Muggles even the Weasleys\u2019 hovel smells okay \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry grabbed hold of George; meanwhile it was taking the combined efforts of Angelina, Alicia, and Katie to stop Fred leaping on Malfoy, who was laughing openly. Harry looked around for Madam Hooch, but she was still berating Crabbe for his illegal Bludger attack.\n\n\u201cOr perhaps,\u201d said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, \u201cyou can remember what your mother\u2019s house stank like, Potter, and Weasley\u2019s pigsty reminds you of it \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting at Malfoy. He had completely forgotten the fact that all the teachers were watching: All he wanted to do was cause Malfoy as much pain as possible. With no time to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could into Malfoy\u2019s stomach \u2014\n\n\u201cHarry! HARRY! GEORGE! NO!\u201d\n\nHe could hear girls\u2019 voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, George swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing of the crowd around him, but he did not care, not until somebody in the vicinity yelled \u201cIMPEDIMENTA!\u201d and only when he was knocked over backward by the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach. . . .\n\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d screamed Madam Hooch, as Harry leapt to his feet again; it was she who had hit him with the Impediment Jinx. She was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other, her broom lay abandoned several feet away. Malfoy was curled up on the ground, whimpering and moaning, his nose bloody; George was sporting a swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the background. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen behavior like it \u2014 back up to the castle, both of you, and straight to your Head of House\u2019s office! Go! Now!\u201d\n\nHarry and George marched off the pitch, both panting, neither saying a word to each other. The howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall, where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps. Harry became aware that something was still struggling in his right hand, the knuckles of which he had bruised against Malfoy\u2019s jaw; looking down he saw the Snitch\u2019s silver wings protruding from between his fingers, struggling for release.\n\nThey had barely reached the door of Professor McGonagall\u2019s office when she came marching along the corridor behind them. She was wearing a Gryffindor scarf, but tore it from her throat with shaking hands as she strode toward them, looking livid.\n\n\u201cIn!\u201d she said furiously, pointing to the door. Harry and George entered. She strode around behind her desk and faced them, quivering with rage as she threw the Gryffindor scarf aside onto the floor.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d she said. \u201cI have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition. Two onto one! Explain yourselves!\u201d\n\n\u201cMalfoy provoked us,\u201d said Harry stiffly.\n\n\u201cProvoked you?\u201d shouted Professor McGonagall, slamming a fist onto her desk so that her tartan biscuit tin slid sideways off it and burst open, littering the floor with Ginger Newts. \u201cHe\u2019d just lost, hadn\u2019t he, of course he wanted to provoke you! But what on earth he can have said that justified what you two \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe insulted my parents,\u201d snarled George. \u201cAnd Harry\u2019s mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out, you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling, did you?\u201d bellowed Professor McGonagall. \u201cHave you any idea what you\u2019ve \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHem, hem.\u201d\n\nGeorge and Harry both spun around. Dolores Umbridge was standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced her resemblance to a giant toad, and smiling in the horribly sickly, ominous way that Harry had come to associate with imminent misery.\n\n\u201cMay I help, Professor McGonagall?\u201d asked Professor Umbridge in her most poisonously sweet voice.\n\nBlood rushed into Professor McGonagall\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cHelp?\u201d she repeated in a constricted voice. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018help\u2019?\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge moved forward into the office, still smiling her sickly smile.\n\n\u201cWhy, I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority.\u201d\n\nHarry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from Professor McGonagall\u2019s nostrils.\n\n\u201cYou thought wrong,\u201d she said, turning her back on Umbridge. \u201cNow, you two had better listen closely. I do not care what provocation Malfoy offered you, I do not care if he insulted every family member you possess, your behavior was disgusting and I am giving each of you a week\u2019s worth of detention! Do not look at me like that, Potter, you deserve it! And if either of you ever \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHem, hem.\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall closed her eyes as though praying for patience as she turned her face toward Professor Umbridge again.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they deserve rather more than detentions,\u201d said Umbridge, smiling still more broadly.\n\nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cBut unfortunately,\u201d she said, with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look as though she had lockjaw, \u201cit is what I think that counts, as they are in my House, Dolores.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, actually, Minerva,\u201d simpered Umbridge, \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that what I think does count. Now, where is it? Cornelius just sent it. . . . I mean,\u201d she gave a little false laugh as she rummaged in her handbag, \u201cthe Minister just sent it. . . . Ah yes . . .\u201d\n\nShe had pulled out a piece of parchment that she now unfurled, clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said.\n\n\u201cHem, hem . . . \u2018Educational Decree Number Twenty-five . . .\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNot another one!\u201d exclaimed Professor McGonagall violently.\n\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Umbridge, still smiling. \u201cAs a matter of fact, Minerva, it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment. . . . You remember how you overrode me, when I was unwilling to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form? How you took the case to Dumbledore, who insisted that the team be allowed to play? Well, now, I couldn\u2019t have that. I contacted the Minister at once, and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges, or she \u2014 that is to say, I \u2014 would have less authority than common teachers! And you see now, don\u2019t you, Minerva, how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor team re-forming? Dreadful tempers . . . Anyway, I was reading out our amendment . . . hem, hem . . . \u2018The High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments, sanctions, and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts, and the power to alter such punishments, sanctions, and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members. Signed, Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, Order of Merlin First Class, etc., etc . . .\u2019\u201d\n\nShe rolled up the parchment and put it back into her handbag, still smiling.\n\n\u201cSo . . . I really think I will have to ban these two from playing Quidditch ever again,\u201d she said, looking from Harry to George and back again.\n\nHarry felt the Snitch fluttering madly in his hand.\n\n\u201cBan us?\u201d he said, and his voice sounded strangely distant. \u201cFrom playing . . . ever again?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Mr. Potter, I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick,\u201d said Umbridge, her smile widening still further as she watched him struggle to comprehend what she had said. \u201cYou and Mr. Weasley here. And I think, to be safe, this young man\u2019s twin ought to be stopped too \u2014 if his teammates had not restrained him, I feel sure he would have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well. I will want their broomsticks confiscated, of course; I shall keep them safely in my office, to make sure there is no infringement of my ban. But I am not unreasonable, Professor McGonagall,\u201d she continued, turning back to Professor McGonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice, staring at her. \u201cThe rest of the team can continue playing, I saw no signs of violence from any of them. Well . . . good afternoon to you.\u201d\n\nAnd with a look of the utmost satisfaction Umbridge left the room, leaving a horrified silence in her wake.\n\n\n\u201cBanned,\u201d said Angelina in a hollow voice, late that evening in the common room. \u201cBanned. No Seeker and no Beaters . . . What on earth are we going to do?\u201d\n\nIt did not feel as though they had won the match at all. Everywhere Harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces; the team themselves were slumped around the fire, all apart from Ron, who had not been seen since the end of the match.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so unfair,\u201d said Alicia numbly. \u201cI mean, what about Crabbe and that Bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown? Has she banned him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ginny miserably; she and Hermione were sitting on either side of Harry. \u201cHe just got lines, I heard Montague laughing about it at dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd banning Fred when he didn\u2019t even do anything!\u201d said Alicia furiously, pummeling her knee with her fist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Fred, with a very ugly look on his face. \u201cI would\u2019ve pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three hadn\u2019t been holding me back.\u201d\n\nHarry stared miserably at the dark window. Snow was falling. The Snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the common room; people were watching its progress as though hypnotized and Crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair, trying to catch it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d said Angelina, getting slowly to her feet. \u201cMaybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream. . . . Maybe I\u2019ll wake up tomorrow and find we haven\u2019t played yet . . .\u201d\n\nShe was soon followed by Alicia and Katie. Fred and George sloped off to bed some time later, glowering at everyone they passed, and Ginny went not long after that. Only Harry and Hermione were left beside the fire.\n\n\u201cHave you seen Ron?\u201d Hermione asked in a low voice.\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s avoiding us,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cWhere do you think he \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut at that precise moment, there was a creaking sound behind them as the Fat Lady swung forward and Ron came clambering through the portrait hole. He was very pale indeed and there was snow in his hair. When he saw Harry and Hermione he stopped dead in his tracks.\n\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d said Hermione anxiously, springing up.\n\n\u201cWalking,\u201d Ron mumbled. He was still wearing his Quidditch things.\n\n\u201cYou look frozen,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cCome and sit down!\u201d\n\nRon walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from Harry\u2019s, not looking at him. The stolen Snitch zoomed over their heads.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ron mumbled, looking at his feet.\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cFor thinking I can play Quidditch,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019m going to resign first thing tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you resign,\u201d said Harry testily, \u201cthere\u2019ll only be three players left on the team.\u201d And when Ron looked puzzled, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been given a lifetime ban. So\u2019ve Fred and George.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ron yelped.\n\nHermione told him the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it again. When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever.\n\n\u201cThis is all my fault \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t make me punch Malfoy,\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\n\u201c\u2014 if I wasn\u2019t so lousy at Quidditch \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 it\u2019s got nothing to do with that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 it was that song that wound me up \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 it would\u2019ve wound anyone up \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione got up and walked to the window, away from the argument, watching the snow swirling down against the pane.\n\n\u201cLook, drop it, will you!\u201d Harry burst out. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything!\u201d\n\nRon said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his robes. After a while he said in a dull voice, \u201cThis is the worst I\u2019ve ever felt in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoin the club,\u201d said Harry bitterly.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Hermione, her voice trembling slightly. \u201cI can think of one thing that might cheer you both up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d said Harry skeptically.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hermione, turning away from the pitch-black, snow-flecked window, a broad smile spreading across her face. \u201cHagrid\u2019s back.\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter20": "HAGRID\u2019S TALE\n\n\n\n\nHarry sprinted up to the boys\u2019 dormitory to fetch the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder\u2019s Map from his trunk; he was so quick that he and Ron were ready to leave at least five minutes before Hermione hurried back down from the girls\u2019 dormitories, wearing scarf, gloves, and one of her own knobbly elf hats.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s cold out there!\u201d she said defensively, as Ron clicked his tongue impatiently.\n\nThey crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the Cloak \u2014 Ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his feet showing \u2014 then, moving slowly and cautiously, they proceeded down the many staircases, pausing at intervals to check the map for signs of Filch or Mrs. Norris. They were lucky; they saw nobody but Nearly Headless Nick, who was gliding along absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like \u201cWeasley Is Our King.\u201d They crept across the entrance hall and then out into the silent, snowy grounds. With a great leap of his heart, Harry saw little golden squares of light ahead and smoke coiling up from Hagrid\u2019s chimney. He set off at a quick march, the other two jostling and bumping along behind him, and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door; when Harry raised his fist and knocked three times, a dog started barking frantically inside.\n\n\u201cHagrid, it\u2019s us!\u201d Harry called through the keyhole.\n\n\u201cShoulda known!\u201d said a gruff voice.\n\nThey beamed at one another under the Cloak; they could tell that Hagrid\u2019s voice was pleased. \u201cBin home three seconds . . . Out the way, Fang . . . Out the way, yeh dozy dog . . .\u201d\n\nThe bolt was drawn back, the door creaked open, and Hagrid\u2019s head appeared in the gap.\n\nHermione screamed.\n\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s beard, keep it down!\u201d said Hagrid hastily, staring wildly over their heads. \u201cUnder that Cloak, are yeh? Well, get in, get in!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past Hagrid into the house and pulled the Cloak off themselves so he could see them. \u201cI just \u2014 oh, Hagrid!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nuthin\u2019, it\u2019s nuthin\u2019!\u201d said Hagrid hastily, shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtains, but Hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror.\n\nHagrid\u2019s hair was matted with congealed blood, and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purple-and-black bruises. There were many cuts on his face and hands, some of them still bleeding, and he was moving gingerly, which made Harry suspect broken ribs. It was obvious that he had only just got home; a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small children leaned against the wall inside the door. Hagrid himself, twice the size of a normal man and three times as broad, was now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Harry demanded, while Fang danced around them all, trying to lick their faces.\n\n\u201cTold yeh, nuthin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid firmly. \u201cWant a cuppa?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome off it,\u201d said Ron, \u201cyou\u2019re in a right state!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 yeh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Hagrid, straightening up and turning to beam at them all, but wincing. \u201cBlimey, it\u2019s good ter see you three again \u2014 had good summers, did yeh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, you\u2019ve been attacked!\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cFer the las\u2019 time, it\u2019s nuthin\u2019!\u201d said Hagrid firmly.\n\n\u201cWould you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face?\u201d Ron demanded.\n\n\u201cYou ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey, Hagrid,\u201d said Hermione anxiously. \u201cSome of those cuts look nasty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dealin\u2019 with it, all righ\u2019?\u201d said Hagrid repressively.\n\nHe walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it. Underneath was a raw, bloody, green-tinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to eat that, are you, Hagrid?\u201d said Ron, leaning in for a closer look. \u201cIt looks poisonous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s s\u2019posed ter look like that, it\u2019s dragon meat,\u201d Hagrid said. \u201cAn\u2019 I didn\u2019 get it ter eat.\u201d\n\nHe picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face. Greenish blood trickled down into his beard as he gave a soft moan of satisfaction.\n\n\u201cTha\u2019s better. It helps with the stingin\u2019, yeh know.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo are you going to tell us what\u2019s happened to you?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019, Harry. Top secret. More\u2019n me job\u2019s worth ter tell yeh that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid the giants beat you up, Hagrid?\u201d asked Hermione quietly.\n\nHagrid\u2019s fingers slipped on the dragon steak, and it slid squelchily onto his chest.\n\n\u201cGiants?\u201d said Hagrid, catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face. \u201cWho said anythin\u2019 abou\u2019 giants? Who yeh bin talkin\u2019 to? Who\u2019s told yeh what I\u2019ve \u2014 who\u2019s said I\u2019ve bin \u2014 eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe guessed,\u201d said Hermione apologetically.\n\n\u201cOh, yeh did, did yeh?\u201d said Hagrid, fixing her sternly with the eye that was not hidden by the steak.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of . . . obvious,\u201d said Ron. Harry nodded.\n\nHagrid glared at them, then snorted, threw the steak onto the table again and strode back to the kettle, which was now whistling.\n\n\u201cNever known kids like you three fer knowin\u2019 more\u2019n yeh oughta,\u201d he muttered, splashing boiling water into three of his bucket-shaped mugs. \u201cAn\u2019 I\u2019m not complimentin\u2019 yeh, neither. Nosy, some\u2019d call it. Interferin\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut his beard twitched.\n\n\u201cSo you have been to look for giants?\u201d said Harry, grinning as he sat down at the table.\n\nHagrid set tea in front of each of them, sat down, picked up his steak again, and slapped it back over his face.\n\n\u201cYeah, all righ\u2019,\u201d he grunted, \u201cI have.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you found them?\u201d said Hermione in a hushed voice.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re not that difficult ter find, ter be honest,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cPretty big, see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cMountains,\u201d said Hagrid unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t Muggles \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do,\u201d said Hagrid darkly. \u201cO\u2019ny their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin\u2019 accidents, aren\u2019 they?\u201d\n\nHe adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising.\n\n\u201cCome on, Hagrid, tell us what you\u2019ve been up to!\u201d said Ron. \u201cTell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors \u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time; a large quantity of spit, tea, and dragon blood was sprayed over the table as Hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid, with a soft splat, onto the floor.\n\n\u201cWhadda yeh mean, attacked by dementors?\u201d growled Hagrid.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d Hermione asked him, wide-eyed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019 know anything that\u2019s been happenin\u2019 since I left. I was on a secret mission, wasn\u2019 I, didn\u2019 wan\u2019 owls followin\u2019 me all over the place \u2014 ruddy dementors! Yeh\u2019re not serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I am, they turned up in Little Whinging and attacked my cousin and me, and then the Ministry of Magic expelled me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and I had to go to a hearing and everything, but tell us about the giants first.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were expelled?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell us about your summer and I\u2019ll tell you about mine.\u201d\n\nHagrid glared at him through his one open eye. Harry looked right back, an expression of innocent determination on his face.\n\n\u201cOh, all righ\u2019,\u201d Hagrid said in a resigned voice.\n\nHe bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cOh, Hagrid, don\u2019t, it\u2019s not hygien \u2014\u201d Hermione began, but Hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye. He took another fortifying gulp of tea and then said, \u201cWell, we set off righ\u2019 after term ended \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame Maxime went with you, then?\u201d Hermione interjected.\n\n\u201cYeah, tha\u2019s right,\u201d said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak. \u201cYeah, it was jus\u2019 the pair of us. An\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yeh this, she\u2019s not afraid of roughin\u2019 it, Olympe. Yeh know, she\u2019s a fine, well-dressed woman, an\u2019 knowin\u2019 where we was goin\u2019 I wondered \u2019ow she\u2019d feel abou\u2019 clamberin\u2019 over boulders an\u2019 sleepin\u2019 in caves an\u2019 tha\u2019, bu\u2019 she never complained once.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou knew where you were going?\u201d Harry asked. \u201cYou knew where the giants were?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Dumbledore knew, an\u2019 he told us,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cAre they hidden?\u201d asked Ron. \u201cIs it a secret, where they are?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. \u201cIt\u2019s jus\u2019 that mos\u2019 wizards aren\u2019 bothered where they are, s\u2019 long as it\u2019s a good long way away. But where they are\u2019s very difficult ter get ter, fer humans anyway, so we needed Dumbledore\u2019s instructions. Took us abou\u2019 a month ter get there \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA month?\u201d said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time. \u201cBut \u2014 why couldn\u2019t you just grab a Portkey or something?\u201d\n\nThere was an odd expression in Hagrid\u2019s unobscured eye as he squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bein\u2019 watched, Ron,\u201d he said gruffly.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeh don\u2019 understand,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThe Ministry\u2019s keepin\u2019 an eye on Dumbledore an\u2019 anyone they reckon\u2019s in league with him, an\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know about that,\u201d said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest of Hagrid\u2019s story. \u201cWe know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you couldn\u2019t use magic to get there?\u201d asked Ron, looking thunderstruck. \u201cYou had to act like Muggles all the way?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, not exactly all the way,\u201d said Hagrid cagily. \u201cWe jus\u2019 had ter be careful, \u2019cause Olympe an\u2019 me, we stick out a bit \u2014\u201d\n\nRon made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea.\n\n\u201c\u2014 so we\u2019re not hard ter follow. We was pretendin\u2019 we was goin\u2019 on holiday together, so we got inter France an\u2019 we made like we was headin\u2019 fer where Olympe\u2019s school is, \u2019cause we knew we was bein\u2019 tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, \u2019cause I\u2019m not really s\u2019posed ter use magic an\u2019 we knew the Ministry\u2019d be lookin\u2019 fer a reason ter run us in. But we managed ter give the berk tailin\u2019 us the slip round abou\u2019 Dee-John \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOoooh, Dijon?\u201d said Hermione excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ve been there on holiday, did you see \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nShe fell silent at the look on Ron\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWe chanced a bit o\u2019 magic after that, and it wasn\u2019 a bad journey. Ran inter a couple o\u2019 mad trolls on the Polish border, an\u2019 I had a sligh\u2019 disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha\u2019, couldn\u2019t\u2019a bin smoother.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 then we reached the place, an\u2019 we started trekkin\u2019 up through the mountains, lookin\u2019 fer signs of \u2019em . . .\n\n\u201cWe had ter lay off the magic once we got near \u2019em. Partly \u2019cause they don\u2019 like wizards an\u2019 we didn\u2019 want ter put their backs up too soon, and partly \u2019cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound ter be after the giants an\u2019 all. Said it was odds on he\u2019d sent a messenger off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin\u2019 attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.\u201d\n\nHagrid paused for a long draught of tea.\n\n\u201cGo on!\u201d said Harry urgently.\n\n\u201cFound \u2019em,\u201d said Hagrid baldly. \u201cWent over a ridge one nigh\u2019 an\u2019 there they was, spread ou\u2019 underneath us. Little fires burnin\u2019 below an\u2019 huge shadows . . . It was like watchin\u2019 bits o\u2019 the mountain movin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow big are they?\u201d asked Ron in a hushed voice.\n\n\u201c\u2019Bout twenty feet,\u201d said Hagrid casually. \u201cSome o\u2019 the bigger ones mighta bin twenty-five.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how many were there?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cI reckon abou\u2019 seventy or eighty,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Hagrid sadly, \u201ceighty left, an\u2019 there was loads once, musta bin a hundred diff\u2019rent tribes from all over the world. But they\u2019ve bin dyin\u2019 out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o\u2019 course, but mostly they killed each other, an\u2019 now they\u2019re dyin\u2019 out faster than ever. They\u2019re not made ter live bunched up together like tha\u2019. Dumbledore says it\u2019s our fault, it was the wizards who forced \u2019em to go an\u2019 made \u2019em live a good long way from us an\u2019 they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cyou saw them and then what?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we waited till morning, didn\u2019 want ter go sneakin\u2019 up on \u2019em in the dark, fer our own safety,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201c\u2019Bout three in the mornin\u2019 they fell asleep jus\u2019 where they was sittin\u2019. We didn\u2019 dare sleep. Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of \u2019em woke up an\u2019 came up where we were, an\u2019 fer another, the snorin\u2019 was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near mornin\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnyway, once it was light we wen\u2019 down ter see \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like that?\u201d said Ron, looking awestruck. \u201cYou just walked right into a giant camp?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Dumbledore\u2019d told us how ter do it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cGive the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive the what gifts?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cOh, the Gurg \u2014 means the chief.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could you tell which one was the Gurg?\u201d asked Ron.\n\nHagrid grunted in amusement.\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the biggest, the ugliest, an\u2019 the laziest. Sittin\u2019 there waitin\u2019 ter be brought food by the others. Dead goats an\u2019 such like. Name o\u2019 Karkus. I\u2019d put him at twenty-two, twenty-three feet, an\u2019 the weight of a couple o\u2019 bull elephants. Skin like rhino hide an\u2019 all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you just walked up to him?\u201d said Hermione breathlessly.\n\n\u201cWell . . . down ter him, where he was lyin\u2019 in the valley. They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an\u2019 Karkus was lyin\u2019 by the lake roarin\u2019 at the others ter feed him an\u2019 his wife. Olympe an\u2019 I went down the mountainside \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t they try and kill you when they saw you?\u201d asked Ron incredulously.\n\n\u201cIt was def\u2019nitely on some of their minds,\u201d said Hagrid, shrugging, \u201cbut we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our gift up high an\u2019 keep our eyes on the Gurg an\u2019 ignore the others. So tha\u2019s what we did. An\u2019 the rest of \u2019em went quiet an\u2019 watched us pass an\u2019 we got right up ter Karkus\u2019s feet an\u2019 we bowed an\u2019 put our present down in front o\u2019 him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you give a giant?\u201d asked Ron eagerly. \u201cFood?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, he can get food all righ\u2019 fer himself,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWe took him magic. Giants like magic, jus\u2019 don\u2019t like us usin\u2019 it against \u2019em. Anyway, that firs\u2019 day we gave him a branch o\u2019 Gubraithian fire.\u201d\n\nHermione said \u201cwow\u201d softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in puzzlement.\n\n\u201cA branch of \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverlasting fire,\u201d said Hermione irritably, \u201cyou ought to know that by now, Professor Flitwick\u2019s mentioned it at least twice in class!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell anyway,\u201d said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could answer back, \u201cDumbledore\u2019d bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn\u2019 somethin\u2019 any wizard could do, an\u2019 so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus\u2019s feet and says, \u2018A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did Karkus say?\u201d asked Harry eagerly.\n\n\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cDidn\u2019 speak English.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019 matter,\u201d said Hagrid imperturbably, \u201cDumbledore had warned us tha\u2019 migh\u2019 happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o\u2019 giants who knew our lingo an\u2019 they translated fer us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did he like the present?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it was,\u201d said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye. \u201cVery pleased. So then I said, \u2018Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you speak to them that day?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cDumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cLet \u2019em see we kept our promises. We\u2019ll come back tomorrow with another present, an\u2019 then we do come back with another present \u2014 gives a good impression, see? An\u2019 gives them time ter test out the firs\u2019 present an\u2019 find out it\u2019s a good one, an\u2019 get \u2019em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus \u2014 overload \u2019em with information an\u2019 they\u2019ll kill yeh jus\u2019 to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an\u2019 went off an\u2019 found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an\u2019 the followin\u2019 mornin\u2019 we went back an\u2019 this time we found Karkus sittin\u2019 up waitin\u2019 fer us lookin\u2019 all eager.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you talked to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah. Firs\u2019 we presented him with a nice battle helmet \u2014 goblin-made an\u2019 indestructible, yeh know \u2014 an\u2019 then we sat down an\u2019 we talked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cListened mostly. But there were good signs. He\u2019d heard o\u2019 Dumbledore, heard he\u2019d argued against the killin\u2019 of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int\u2019rested in what Dumbledore had ter say. An\u2019 a few o\u2019 the others, \u2019specially the ones who had some English, they gathered round an\u2019 listened too. We were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next day with another present.\n\n\u201cBut that night it all wen\u2019 wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Ron quickly.\n\n\u201cWell, like I say, they\u2019re not meant ter live together, giants,\u201d said Hagrid sadly. \u201cNot in big groups like that. They can\u2019 help themselves, they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an\u2019 the women fight each other, the remnants of the old tribes fight each other, an\u2019 that\u2019s even without squabbles over food an\u2019 the best fires an\u2019 sleepin\u2019 spots. Yeh\u2019d think, seein\u2019 as how their whole race is abou\u2019 finished, they\u2019d lay off each other, but . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid sighed deeply.\n\n\u201cThat night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our cave, lookin\u2019 down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn\u2019 believe the noise. An\u2019 when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an\u2019 his head was lyin\u2019 at the bottom o\u2019 the lake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose head?\u201d gasped Hermione.\n\n\u201cKarkus\u2019s,\u201d said Hagrid heavily. \u201cThere was a new Gurg, Golgomath.\u201d He sighed deeply. \u201cWell, we hadn\u2019 bargained on a new Gurg two days after we\u2019d made friendly contact with the firs\u2019 one, an\u2019 we had a funny feelin\u2019 Golgomath wouldn\u2019 be so keen ter listen to us, but we had ter try.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou went to speak to him?\u201d asked Ron incredulously. \u201cAfter you\u2019d watched him rip off another giant\u2019s head?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course we did,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cwe hadn\u2019 gone all that way ter give up after two days! We wen\u2019 down with the next present we\u2019d meant ter give ter Karkus.\n\n\u201cI knew it was no go before I\u2019d opened me mouth. He was sitting there wearin\u2019 Karkus\u2019s helmet, leerin\u2019 at us as we got nearer. He\u2019s massive, one o\u2019 the biggest ones there. Black hair an\u2019 matchin\u2019 teeth an\u2019 a necklace o\u2019 bones. Human-lookin\u2019 bones, some of \u2019em. Well, I gave it a go \u2014 held out a great roll o\u2019 dragon skin \u2014 an\u2019 said \u2018A gift fer the Gurg of the giants \u2014\u2019 Nex\u2019 thing I knew, I was hangin\u2019 upside down in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.\u201d\n\nHermione clapped her hands to her mouth.\n\n\u201cHow did you get out of that?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019ta done if Olympe hadn\u2019 bin there,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cShe pulled out her wand an\u2019 did some o\u2019 the fastes\u2019 spellwork I\u2019ve ever seen. Ruddy marvelous. Hit the two holdin\u2019 me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an\u2019 they dropped me straightaway \u2014 bu\u2019 we were in trouble then, \u2019cause we\u2019d used magic against \u2019em, an\u2019 that\u2019s what giants hate abou\u2019 wizards. We had ter leg it an\u2019 we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlimey, Hagrid,\u201d said Ron quietly.\n\n\u201cSo how come it\u2019s taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019 leave after three days!\u201d said Hagrid, looking outraged. \u201cDumbledore was relyin\u2019 on us!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve just said there was no way you could go back!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot by daylight, we couldn\u2019, no. We just had ter rethink a bit. Spent a couple o\u2019 days lyin\u2019 low up in the cave an\u2019 watchin\u2019. An\u2019 wha\u2019 we saw wasn\u2019 good.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he rip off more heads?\u201d asked Hermione, sounding squeamish.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cI wish he had.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean we soon found out he didn\u2019 object ter all wizards \u2014 just us.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeath Eaters?\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Hagrid darkly. \u201cCouple of \u2019em were visitin\u2019 him ev\u2019ry day, bringin\u2019 gifts ter the Gurg, an\u2019 he wasn\u2019 dangling them upside down.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you know they were Death Eaters?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cBecause I recognized one of \u2019em,\u201d Hagrid growled. \u201cMacnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin\u2019 as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin\u2019 on so well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Macnair\u2019s persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?\u201d said Hermione desperately.\n\n\u201cHold yer hippogriffs, I haven\u2019 finished me story yet!\u201d said Hagrid indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. \u201cMe an\u2019 Olympe talked it over an\u2019 we agreed, jus\u2019 \u2019cause the Gurg looked like favorin\u2019 You-Know-Who didn\u2019 mean all of \u2019em would. We had ter try an\u2019 persuade some o\u2019 the others, the ones who hadn\u2019 wanted Golgomath as Gurg.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could you tell which ones they were?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, they were the ones bein\u2019 beaten to a pulp, weren\u2019 they?\u201d said Hagrid patiently. \u201cThe ones with any sense were keepin\u2019 outta Golgomath\u2019s way, hidin\u2019 out in caves roun\u2019 the gully jus\u2019 like we were. So we decided we\u2019d go pokin\u2019 round the caves by night an\u2019 see if we couldn\u2019 persuade a few o\u2019 them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou went poking around dark caves looking for giants?\u201d said Ron with awed respect in his voice.\n\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019 the giants who worried us most,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWe were more concerned abou\u2019 the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen\u2019 not ter tangle with \u2019em if we could avoid it, an\u2019 the trouble was they knew we was around \u2014 \u2019spect Golgomath told him abou\u2019 us. At night when the giants were sleepin\u2019 an\u2019 we wanted ter be creepin\u2019 inter the caves, Macnair an\u2019 the other one were sneakin\u2019 round the mountains lookin\u2019 fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin\u2019 out at them,\u201d said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard. \u201cShe was rarin\u2019 ter attack \u2019em. . . . She\u2019s somethin\u2019 when she\u2019s roused, Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh know . . . \u2019spect it\u2019s the French in her . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty seconds\u2019 reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly.\n\n\u201cSo what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we\u2019d bin hidin\u2019 in and headed back down inter the gully, keepin\u2019 our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o\u2019 the caves, no go \u2014 then, in abou\u2019 the sixth one, we found three giants hidin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cCave must\u2019ve been cramped,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019 room ter swing a kneazle,\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t they attack you when they saw you?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cProbably woulda done if they\u2019d bin in any condition,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbut they was badly hurt, all three o\u2019 them. Golgomath\u2019s lot had beaten \u2019em unconscious; they\u2019d woken up an\u2019 crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o\u2019 them had a bit of English an\u2019 \u2019e translated fer the others, an\u2019 what we had ter say didn\u2019 seem ter go down too badly. So we kep\u2019 goin\u2019 back, visitin\u2019 the wounded. . . . I reckon we had abou\u2019 six or seven o\u2019 them convinced at one poin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cSix or seven?\u201d said Ron eagerly. \u201cWell that\u2019s not bad \u2014 are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?\u201d\n\nBut Hermione said, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018at one point,\u2019 Hagrid?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked at her sadly.\n\n\u201cGolgomath\u2019s lot raided the caves. The ones tha\u2019 survived didn\u2019 wan\u2019 no more ter to do with us after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo . . . so there aren\u2019t any giants coming?\u201d said Ron, looking disappointed.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, \u201cbut we did wha\u2019 we meant ter do, we gave \u2019em Dumbledore\u2019s message an\u2019 some o\u2019 them heard it an\u2019 I \u2019spect some o\u2019 them\u2019ll remember it. Jus\u2019 maybe, them that don\u2019 want ter stay around Golgomath\u2019ll move outta the mountains, an\u2019 there\u2019s gotta be a chance they\u2019ll remember Dumbledore\u2019s friendly to \u2019em. . . . Could be they\u2019ll come . . .\u201d\n\nSnow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the knees of his robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with his head in Harry\u2019s lap.\n\n\u201cHagrid?\u201d said Hermione quietly after a while.\n\n\u201cMmm?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything about your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s unobscured eye rested upon her, and Hermione looked rather scared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry . . . I . . . forget it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDead,\u201d Hagrid grunted. \u201cDied years ago. They told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d said Hermione in a very small voice.\n\nHagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. \u201cNo need,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cCan\u2019 remember her much. Wasn\u2019 a great mother.\u201d\n\nThey were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and Ron, plainly wanting them to speak.\n\n\u201cBut you still haven\u2019t explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,\u201d Ron said, gesturing toward Hagrid\u2019s bloodstained face.\n\n\u201cOr why you\u2019re back so late,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho attacked you?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019 bin attacked!\u201d said Hagrid emphatically. \u201cI \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s her!\u201d Ron whispered.\n\n\u201cGet under here!\u201d Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the table and dived beneath the Cloak as well. Huddled together they backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Hagrid looked thoroughly confused.\n\n\u201cHagrid, hide our mugs!\u201d\n\nHagrid seized Harry\u2019s and Ron\u2019s mugs and shoved them under the cushion in Fang\u2019s basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door; Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open.\n\nProfessor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she leaned back so as to see Hagrid\u2019s face; she barely reached his navel.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody deaf. \u201cYou\u2019re Hagrid, are you?\u201d\n\nWithout waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her bulging eyes rolling in every direction.\n\n\u201cGet away,\u201d she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 I don\u2019 want ter be rude,\u201d said Hagrid, staring at her, \u201cbut who the ruddy hell are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Dolores Umbridge.\u201d\n\nHer eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cDolores Umbridge?\u201d Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused. \u201cI thought you were one o\u2019 them Ministry \u2014 don\u2019 you work with Fudge?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,\u201d said Umbridge, now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. \u201cI am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTha\u2019s brave of yeh,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cthere\u2019s not many\u2019d take tha\u2019 job anymore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,\u201d said Umbridge, giving no sign that she had heard him.\n\n\u201cWha\u2019s that?\u201d said Hagrid, frowning.\n\n\u201cPrecisely what I was going to ask,\u201d said Umbridge, pointing at the broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione\u2019s mug.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, \u201coh, tha\u2019 was . . . was Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.\u201d\n\nHagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabin\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI heard voices,\u201d she said quietly.\n\n\u201cI was talkin\u2019 ter Fang,\u201d said Hagrid stoutly.\n\n\u201cAnd was he talking back to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . in a manner o\u2019 speakin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable. \u201cI sometimes say Fang\u2019s near enough human \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,\u201d said Umbridge sleekly.\n\nHermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily, Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge\u2019s robes, and she did not appear to have heard.\n\n\u201cWell, I on\u2019y jus\u2019 got back,\u201d said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand at the haversack. \u201cMaybe someone came ter call earlier an\u2019 I missed \u2019em.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I . . . I don\u2019 know why that\u2019d be . . .\u201d said Hagrid, tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help. \u201cErm . . .\u201d\n\nUmbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin, looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She opened Hagrid\u2019s cupboards. She passed within two inches of where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled around again and said, \u201cWhat has happened to you? How did you sustain those injuries?\u201d\n\nHagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in Harry\u2019s opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. \u201cOh, I . . . had a bit of an accident,\u201d he said lamely.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of accident?\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I tripped.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tripped,\u201d she repeated coolly.\n\n\u201cYeah, tha\u2019s right. Over . . . over a friend\u2019s broomstick. I don\u2019 fly, meself. Well, look at the size o\u2019 me, I don\u2019 reckon there\u2019s a broomstick that\u2019d hold me. Friend o\u2019 mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if you\u2019ve ever seen \u2019em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I\u2019ve had a bit of a ride on one o\u2019 them an\u2019 it was \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through Hagrid\u2019s babbling.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve I . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cBeen, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cTerm started more than two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 I\u2019ve been away for me health,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor your health,\u201d said Umbridge. Her eyes traveled over Hagrid\u2019s discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his waistcoat in the silence. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid, \u201cbit o\u2019 \u2014 o\u2019 fresh air, yeh know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,\u201d said Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid\u2019s face that was not black or purple flushed.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 change o\u2019 scene, yeh know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMountain scenery?\u201d said Umbridge swiftly.\n\nShe knows, Harry thought desperately.\n\n\u201cMountains?\u201d Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. \u201cNope, South of France fer me. Bit o\u2019 sun an\u2019 . . . an\u2019 sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Umbridge. \u201cYou don\u2019t have much of a tan.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . well . . . sensitive skin,\u201d said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said, \u201cI shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.\u201d\n\n\u201cRigh\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding.\n\n\u201cYou ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough.\u201d\n\nShe turned sharply and marched back to the door.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re inspectin\u2019 us?\u201d Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand on the door handle. \u201cThe Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Good night.\u201d\n\nShe left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d she breathed in his ear. \u201cShe might not be gone yet.\u201d\n\nHagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s goin\u2019 back ter the castle,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cBlimey . . . inspectin\u2019 people, is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, pulling the Cloak off. \u201cTrelawney\u2019s on probation already . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cUm . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019 you worry abou\u2019 that, I\u2019ve got a great load o\u2019 lessons planned,\u201d said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again. \u201cI\u2019ve bin keepin\u2019 a couple o\u2019 creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they\u2019re somethin\u2019 really special.\u201d\n\n\u201cErm . . . special in what way?\u201d asked Hermione tentatively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid happily. \u201cI don\u2019 want ter spoil the surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Hagrid,\u201d said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense, \u201cProfessor Umbridge won\u2019t be at all happy if you bring anything to class that\u2019s too dangerous \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDangerous?\u201d said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. \u201cDon\u2019 be silly, I wouldn\u2019 give yeh anythin\u2019 dangerous! I mean, all righ\u2019, they can look after themselves \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, you\u2019ve got to pass Umbridge\u2019s inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that!\u201d said Hermione earnestly.\n\n\u201cBut tha\u2019s not very interestin\u2019, Hermione,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThe stuff I\u2019ve got\u2019s much more impressive, I\u2019ve bin bringin\u2019 \u2019em on fer years, I reckon I\u2019ve got the on\u2019y domestic herd in Britain \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid . . . please . . .\u201d said Hermione, a note of real desperation in her voice. \u201cUmbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us something dull that\u2019s bound to come up in our O.W.L . . .\u201d\n\nBut Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing toward the vast bed in the corner.\n\n\u201cLis\u2019en, it\u2019s bin a long day an\u2019 it\u2019s late,\u201d he said, patting Hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. \u201cOh \u2014 sorry \u2014\u201d He pulled her back up by the neck of her robes. \u201cLook, don\u2019 you go worryin\u2019 abou\u2019 me, I promise yeh I\u2019ve got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I\u2019m back. . . . Now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an\u2019 don\u2019 forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno if you got through to him,\u201d said Ron a short while later when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they went.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go back again tomorrow,\u201d said Hermione determinedly. \u201cI\u2019ll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don\u2019t care if she throws out Trelawney but she\u2019s not taking Hagrid!\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter21": "THE EYE OF THE SNAKE\n\n\n\n\nHermione plowed her way back to Hagrid\u2019s cabin through two feet of snow on Sunday morning. Harry and Ron wanted to go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so they grudgingly remained in the common room, trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing, and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.\n\n\u201cOy!\u201d bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window, \u201cI am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window \u2014 OUCH!\u201d\n\nHe withdrew his head sharply, his face covered in snow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Fred and George,\u201d he said bitterly, slamming the window behind him. \u201cGits . . .\u201d\n\nHermione returned from Hagrid\u2019s just before lunch, shivering slightly, her robes damp to the knees.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d said Ron, looking up when she entered. \u201cGot all his lessons planned for him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I tried,\u201d she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. She pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which began to steam as they dried out. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even there when I arrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came stumping out of the forest \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. \u201cWhat\u2019s he keeping in there? Did he say?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione miserably. \u201cHe says he wants them to be a surprise. I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn\u2019t get it. He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls than chimaeras \u2014 oh I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got a chimaera,\u201d she added at the appalled look on Harry and Ron\u2019s faces, \u201cbut that\u2019s not for lack of trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs. . . . I don\u2019t know how many times I told him he\u2019d be better off following Grubbly-Plank\u2019s plan, I honestly don\u2019t think he listened to half of what I said. He\u2019s in a bit of a funny mood, you know. He still won\u2019t say how he got all those injuries . . .\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from all students. Some, like Fred, George, and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid\u2019s enormous hand; others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads. Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly-Plank\u2019s lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank\u2019s idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off.\n\nIt was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron, and Hermione headed down to Hagrid\u2019s on Tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold. Harry was worried, not only about what Hagrid might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly Malfoy and his cronies, would behave if Umbridge was watching them.\n\nHowever, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow toward Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on the edge of the forest. He did not present a reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding. Harry could not understand this: Had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re workin\u2019 in here today!\u201d Hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind him. \u201cBit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat prefers the dark?\u201d Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice. \u201cWhat did he say prefers the dark \u2014 did you hear?\u201d\n\nHarry remembered the only occasion on which Malfoy had entered the forest before now; he had not been very brave then either. He smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused Malfoy discomfort was all right with him.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d said Hagrid happily, looking around at the class. \u201cRight, well, I\u2019ve bin savin\u2019 a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we\u2019d go an\u2019 see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we\u2019re studyin\u2019 today is pretty rare, I reckon I\u2019m probably the on\u2019y person in Britain who\u2019s managed ter train \u2019em \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure they\u2019re trained, are you?\u201d said Malfoy, the panic in his voice even more pronounced now. \u201cOnly it wouldn\u2019t be the first time you\u2019d brought wild stuff to class, would it?\u201d\n\nThe Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point too.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course they\u2019re trained,\u201d said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder.\n\n\u201cSo what happened to your face, then?\u201d demanded Malfoy.\n\n\u201cMind yer own business!\u201d said Hagrid, angrily. \u201cNow if yeh\u2019ve finished askin\u2019 stupid questions, follow me!\u201d\n\nHe turned and strode straight into the forest. Nobody seemed much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading the rest of the class.\n\nThey walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow on the ground at all. Hagrid deposited his half a cow with a grunt on the ground, stepped back, and turned to face his class again, most of whom were creeping toward him from tree to tree, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at any moment.\n\n\u201cGather roun\u2019, gather roun\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid encouragingly. \u201cNow, they\u2019ll be attracted by the smell o\u2019 the meat but I\u2019m goin\u2019 ter give \u2019em a call anyway, \u2019cause they\u2019ll like ter know it\u2019s me . . .\u201d\n\nHe turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face, and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed; most of them looked too scared to make a sound.\n\nHagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then, as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.\n\nA pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck, and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the darkness. It looked around at the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs.\n\nA great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Hagrid call again?\u201d\n\nMost of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as Ron\u2019s and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face, and Neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.\n\n\u201cOh, an\u2019 here comes another one!\u201d said Hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery wings closer to its body, and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. \u201cNow . . . put yer hands up, who can see \u2019em?\u201d\n\nImmensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand. Hagrid nodded at him.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . yeah, I knew you\u2019d be able ter, Harry,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cAn\u2019 you too, Neville, eh? An\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Malfoy in a sneering voice, \u201cbut what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?\u201d\n\nFor answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people gasped and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: Bits of flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s doing it?\u201d Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating behind the nearest tree. \u201cWhat\u2019s eating it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThestrals,\u201d said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft \u201coh!\u201d of comprehension at Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHogwarts has got a whole herd of \u2019em in here. Now, who knows \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re really, really unlucky!\u201d interrupted Parvati, looking alarmed. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Hagrid, chuckling, \u201ctha\u2019s jus\u2019 superstition, that is, they aren\u2019 unlucky, they\u2019re dead clever an\u2019 useful! \u2019Course, this lot don\u2019 get a lot o\u2019 work, it\u2019s mainly jus\u2019 pullin\u2019 the school carriages unless Dumbledore\u2019s takin\u2019 a long journey an\u2019 don\u2019 want ter Apparate \u2014 an\u2019 here\u2019s another couple, look \u2014\u201d\n\nTwo more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing very close to Parvati, who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree, saying, \u201cI think I felt something, I think it\u2019s near me!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 worry, it won\u2019 hurt yeh,\u201d said Hagrid patiently. \u201cRigh\u2019, now, who can tell me why some o\u2019 you can see them an\u2019 some can\u2019t?\u201d\n\nHermione raised her hand.\n\n\u201cGo on then,\u201d said Hagrid, beaming at her.\n\n\u201cThe only people who can see thestrals,\u201d she said, \u201care people who have seen death.\u201d\n\n\u201cTha\u2019s exactly right,\u201d said Hagrid solemnly, \u201cten points ter Gryffindor. Now, thestrals \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHem, hem.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge had arrived. She was standing a few feet away from Harry, wearing her green hat and cloak again, her clipboard at the ready. Hagrid, who had never heard Umbridge\u2019s fake cough before, was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral, evidently under the impression that it had made the sound.\n\n\u201cHem, hem.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh hello!\u201d Hagrid said, smiling, having located the source of the noise.\n\n\u201cYou received the note I sent to your cabin this morning?\u201d said Umbridge, in the same loud, slow voice she had used with him earlier, as though she was addressing somebody both foreign and very slow. \u201cTelling you that I would be inspecting your lesson?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Hagrid brightly. \u201cGlad yeh found the place all righ\u2019! Well, as you can see \u2014 or, I dunno \u2014 can you? We\u2019re doin\u2019 thestrals today \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d said Umbridge loudly, cupping her hand around her ear and frowning. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\nHagrid looked a little confused.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 thestrals!\u201d he said loudly. \u201cBig \u2014 er \u2014 winged horses, yeh know!\u201d\n\nHe flapped his gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard, \u201c\u2018has . . . to . . . resort . . . to . . . crude . . . sign . . . language . . .\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . anyway . . .\u201d said Hagrid, turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered. \u201cErm . . . what was I sayin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Appears . . . to . . . have . . . poor . . . short . . . term . . . memory . . .\u2019\u201d muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her. Draco Malfoy looked as though Christmas had come a month early; Hermione, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage.\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Hagrid, throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridge\u2019s clipboard, but plowing on valiantly. \u201cYeah, I was gonna tell yeh how come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a male an\u2019 five females. This one,\u201d he patted the first horse to have appeared, \u201cname o\u2019 Tenebrus, he\u2019s my special favorite, firs\u2019 one born here in the forest \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you aware,\u201d Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, \u201cthat the Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as \u2018dangerous\u2019?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart sank like a stone, but Hagrid merely chuckled.\n\n\u201cThestrals aren\u2019 dangerous! All righ\u2019, they might take a bite outta you if yeh really annoy them \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Shows . . . signs . . . of . . . pleasure . . . at . . . idea . . . of . . . violence . . .\u2019\u201d muttered Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard again.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 come on!\u201d said Hagrid, looking a little anxious now. \u201cI mean, a dog\u2019ll bite if yeh bait it, won\u2019 it \u2014 but thestrals have jus\u2019 got a bad reputation because o\u2019 the death thing \u2014 people used ter think they were bad omens, didn\u2019 they? Jus\u2019 didn\u2019 understand, did they?\u201d\n\nUmbridge did not answer; she finished writing her last note, then looked up at Hagrid and said, again very loudly and slowly, \u201cPlease continue teaching as usual. I am going to walk\u201d \u2014 she mimed walking \u2014 Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter \u2014 \u201camong the students\u201d \u2014 she pointed around at individual members of the class \u2014 \u201cand ask them questions.\u201d She pointed at her mouth to indicate talking.\n\nHagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why she was acting as though he did not understand normal English. Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now.\n\n\u201cYou hag, you evil hag!\u201d she whispered, as Umbridge walked toward Pansy Parkinson. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing, you awful, twisted, vicious \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cErm . . . anyway,\u201d said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson, \u201cso \u2014 thestrals. Yeah. Well, there\u2019s loads o\u2019 good stuff abou\u2019 them . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you find,\u201d said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy Parkinson, \u201cthat you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he talks?\u201d\n\nJust like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was trying to suppress her giggles. \u201cNo . . . because . . . well . . . it sounds . . . like grunting a lot of the time . . .\u201d\n\nUmbridge scribbled on her clipboard. The few unbruised bits of Hagrid\u2019s face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard Pansy\u2019s answer.\n\n\u201cEr . . . yeah . . . good stuff abou\u2019 thestrals. Well, once they\u2019re tamed, like this lot, yeh\u2019ll never be lost again. \u2019Mazin\u2019 senses o\u2019 direction, jus\u2019 tell \u2019em where yeh want ter go \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAssuming they can understand you, of course,\u201d said Malfoy loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to Neville.\n\n\u201cYou can see the thestrals, Longbottom, can you?\u201d she said.\n\nNeville nodded.\n\n\u201cWhom did you see die?\u201d she asked, her tone indifferent.\n\n\u201cMy . . . my grandad,\u201d said Neville.\n\n\u201cAnd what do you think of them?\u201d she said, waving her stubby hand at the horses, who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone.\n\n\u201cErm,\u201d said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid. \u201cWell, they\u2019re . . . er . . . okay . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Students . . . are . . . too . . . intimidated . . . to . . . admit . . . they . . . are . . . frightened . . .\u2019\u201d muttered Umbridge, making another note on her clipboard.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Neville, looking upset, \u201cno, I\u2019m not scared of them \u2014 !\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right,\u201d said Umbridge, patting Neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile, though it looked more like a leer to Harry. \u201cWell, Hagrid,\u201d she turned to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice, \u201cI think I\u2019ve got enough to be getting along with. . . . You will receive\u201d \u2014 she mimed taking something from the air in front of her \u2014 \u201cthe results of your inspection\u201d \u2014 she pointed at the clipboard \u2014 \u201cin ten days\u2019 time.\u201d She held up ten stubby little fingers, then, her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat, she bustled from their midst, leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits of laughter, Hermione actually shaking with fury, and Neville looking confused and upset.\n\n\u201cThat foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle!\u201d stormed Hermione half an hour later, as they made their way back up to the castle through the channels they had made earlier in the snow. \u201cYou see what she\u2019s up to? It\u2019s her thing about half-breeds all over again \u2014 she\u2019s trying to make out Hagrid\u2019s some kind of dim-witted troll, just because he had a giantess for a mother \u2014 and oh, it\u2019s not fair, that really wasn\u2019t a bad lesson at all \u2014 I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts again, but thestrals are fine \u2014 in fact, for Hagrid, they\u2019re really good!\u201d\n\n\u201cUmbridge said they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,\u201d said Hermione impatiently, \u201cand I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn\u2019t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T. level, but, well, they are very interesting, aren\u2019t they? The way some people can see them and some can\u2019t! I wish I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Harry asked her quietly.\n\nShe looked horrorstruck.\n\n\u201cOh Harry \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014 no, of course I don\u2019t \u2014 that was a really stupid thing to say \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cdon\u2019t worry . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised so many people could see them,\u201d said Ron. \u201cThree in a class \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,\u201d said a malicious voice nearby. Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were walking along right behind them. \u201cD\u2019you reckon if you saw someone snuff it you\u2019d be able to see the Quaffle better?\u201d\n\nHe, Crabbe, and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on their way to the castle and then broke into a chorus of \u201cWeasley Is Our King.\u201d Ron\u2019s ears turned scarlet.\n\n\u201cIgnore them, just ignore them,\u201d intoned Hermione, pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses.\n\n\nDecember arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth years. Ron and Hermione\u2019s prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached. They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle (\u201cYou try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it,\u201d said Ron), to watch over first and second years spending their break times inside because of the bitter cold (\u201cAnd they\u2019re cheeky little snotrags, you know, we definitely weren\u2019t that rude when we were in first year,\u201d said Ron), and to patrol the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels (\u201cHe\u2019s got dung for brains, that one,\u201d said Ron furiously). They were so busy that Hermione had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was down to her last three.\n\n\u201cAll those poor elves I haven\u2019t set free yet, having to stay over during Christmas because there aren\u2019t enough hats!\u201d\n\nHarry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking everything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay. In any case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away from Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resentful toward the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked forward to were the D.A. meetings, and they would have to stop over the holidays, as nearly everybody in the D.A. would be spending the time with their families. Hermione was going skiing with her parents, something that greatly amused Ron, who had never before heard of Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down mountains. Ron, meanwhile, was going home to the Burrow. Harry endured several days of jealousy before Ron said, in response to Harry asking how Ron was going to get home for Christmas, \u201cBut you\u2019re coming too! Didn\u2019t I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago!\u201d\n\nHermione rolled her eyes, but Harry\u2019s spirits soared: The thought of Christmas at the Burrow was truly wonderful, only slightly marred by Harry\u2019s guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade Mrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities too, but apart from the fact that he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place, he could not help but feel that Mrs. Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire, and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on the constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think of Sirius alone in his mother\u2019s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with Kreacher.\n\nHarry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D.A. meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when the lamps burst into light he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry\u2019s face and bearing the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!\n\nHarry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking dreamy as always.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the decorations. \u201cThese are nice, did you put them up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cit was Dobby the house-elf.\u201d\n\n\u201cMistletoe,\u201d said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white berries placed almost over Harry\u2019s head. He jumped out from under it. \u201cGood thinking,\u201d said Luna very seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s often infested with nargles.\u201d\n\nHarry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the arrival of Angelina, Katie, and Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, \u201cwe\u2019ve replaced you.\u201d\n\n\u201cReplaced me?\u201d said Harry blankly.\n\n\u201cYou and Fred and George,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another Seeker!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cGinny Weasley,\u201d said Katie.\n\nHarry gaped at her.\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her arm. \u201cBut she\u2019s pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,\u201d she said, throwing him a very dirty look, \u201cbut as we can\u2019t have you . . .\u201d\n\nHarry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: Did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did?\n\n\u201cAnd what about the Beaters?\u201d he asked, trying to keep his voice even.\n\n\u201cAndrew Kirke,\u201d said Alicia without enthusiasm, \u201cand Jack Sloper. Neither of them are brilliant, but compared with the rest of the idiots who turned up . . .\u201d\n\nThe arrival of Ron, Hermione, and Neville brought this depressing discussion to an end and within five minutes, the room was full enough to prevent him seeing Angelina\u2019s burning, reproachful looks.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, calling them all to order. \u201cI thought this evening we should just go over the things we\u2019ve done so far, because it\u2019s the last meeting before the holidays and there\u2019s no point starting anything new right before a three-week break \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything new?\u201d said Zacharias Smith, in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. \u201cIf I\u2019d known that, I wouldn\u2019t have come . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all really sorry Harry didn\u2019t tell you, then,\u201d said Fred loudly.\n\nSeveral people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a step going downstairs.\n\n\u201cWe can practice in pairs,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with the Impediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions and try Stunning again.\u201d\n\nThey all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual. The room was soon full of intermittent cries of \u201cImpedimenta!\u201d People froze for a minute or so, during which their partners would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx.\n\nNeville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when Harry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others. When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times.\n\nAfter ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again. Space was really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the group observed the others for a while, then swapped over. Harry felt himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True, Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else had made enormous progress.\n\nAt the end of an hour, Harry called a halt.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting really good,\u201d he said, beaming around at them. \u201cWhen we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff \u2014 maybe even Patronuses.\u201d\n\nThere was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a Happy Christmas as they went. Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he was hoping to receive a Merry Christmas from her.\n\n\u201cNo, you go on,\u201d he heard her say to her friend Marietta, and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam\u2019s apple.\n\nHe pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak. Instead, he heard a hearty sniff.\n\nHe turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face.\n\n\u201cWha \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t know what to do. She was simply standing there, crying silently.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he said feebly.\n\nShe shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve. \u201cI\u2019m \u2014 sorry,\u201d she said thickly. \u201cI suppose . . . it\u2019s just . . . learning all this stuff. . . . It just makes me . . . wonder whether . . . if he\u2019d known it all . . . he\u2019d still be alive . . .\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel. He ought to have known. She wanted to talk about Cedric.\n\n\u201cHe did know this stuff,\u201d Harry said heavily. \u201cHe was really good at it, or he could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d\n\nShe hiccuped at the sound of Voldemort\u2019s name, but stared at Harry without flinching.\n\n\u201cYou survived when you were just a baby,\u201d she said quietly.\n\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d said Harry wearily, moving toward the door, \u201cI dunno why, nor does anyone else, so it\u2019s nothing to be proud of.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t go!\u201d said Cho, sounding tearful again. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to get all upset like this. . . . I didn\u2019t mean to . . .\u201d\n\nShe hiccuped again. She was very pretty even when her eyes were red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly miserable. He\u2019d have been so pleased just with a Merry Christmas. . . .\n\n\u201cI know it must be horrible for you,\u201d she said, mopping her eyes on her sleeve again. \u201cMe mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die. . . . I suppose you just want to forget about it . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but he felt heartless saying it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a r-really good teacher, you know,\u201d said Cho, with a watery smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to Stun anything before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry awkwardly.\n\nThey looked at each other for a long moment. Harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move his feet.\n\n\u201cMistletoe,\u201d said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. His mouth was very dry. \u201cIt\u2019s probably full of nargles, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are nargles?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Harry. She had moved closer. His brain seemed to have been Stunned. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.\u201d\n\nCho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She was even nearer him now. He could have counted the freckles on her nose.\n\n\u201cI really like you, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe could not think. A tingling sensation was spreading throughout him, paralyzing his arms, legs, and brain.\n\nShe was much too close. He could see every tear clinging to her eyelashes. . . .\n\n\nHe returned to the common room half an hour later to find Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else had gone to bed. Hermione was writing a very long letter; she had already filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the edge of the table. Ron was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish his Transfiguration homework.\n\n\u201cWhat kept you?\u201d he asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next to Hermione\u2019s.\n\nHarry did not answer. He was in a state of shock. Half of him wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened, but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave.\n\n\u201cAre you all right, Harry?\u201d Hermione asked, peering at him over the tip of her quill.\n\nHarry gave a halfhearted shrug. In truth, he didn\u2019t know whether he was all right or not.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Ron, hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d\n\nHarry didn\u2019t quite know how to set about telling them, and still wasn\u2019t sure whether he wanted to. Just as he had decided not to say anything, Hermione took matters out of his hands.\n\n\u201cIs it Cho?\u201d she asked in a businesslike way. \u201cDid she corner you after the meeting?\u201d\n\nNumbly surprised, Harry nodded. Ron sniggered, breaking off when Hermione caught his eye.\n\n\u201cSo \u2014 er \u2014 what did she want?\u201d he asked in a mock casual voice.\n\n\u201cShe \u2014\u201d Harry began, rather hoarsely; he cleared his throat and tried again. \u201cShe \u2014 er \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you kiss?\u201d asked Hermione briskly.\n\nRon sat up so fast that he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug. Disregarding this completely he stared avidly at Harry.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d he demanded.\n\nHarry looked from Ron\u2019s expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione\u2019s slight frown, and nodded.\n\n\u201cHA!\u201d\n\nRon made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timid-looking second years over beside the window jump. A reluctant grin spread over Harry\u2019s face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug. Hermione gave Ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her letter.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. \u201cHow was it?\u201d\n\nHarry considered for a moment.\n\n\u201cWet,\u201d he said truthfully.\n\nRon made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust, it was hard to tell.\n\n\u201cBecause she was crying,\u201d Harry continued heavily.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Ron, his smile fading slightly. \u201cAre you that bad at kissing?\u201d\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Harry, who hadn\u2019t considered this, and immediately felt rather worried. \u201cMaybe I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you\u2019re not,\u201d said Hermione absently, still scribbling away at her letter.\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d said Ron in a sharp voice.\n\n\u201cBecause Cho spends half her time crying these days,\u201d said Hermione vaguely. \u201cShe does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think a bit of kissing would cheer her up,\u201d said Ron, grinning.\n\n\u201cRon,\u201d said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into her ink pot, \u201cyou are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d said Ron indignantly. \u201cWhat sort of person cries while someone\u2019s kissing them?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, slightly desperately, \u201cwho does?\u201d\n\nHermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you understand how Cho\u2019s feeling at the moment?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry and Ron together.\n\nHermione sighed and laid down her quill.\n\n\u201cWell, obviously, she\u2019s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect she\u2019s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can\u2019t work out who she likes best. Then she\u2019ll be feeling guilty, thinking it\u2019s an insult to Cedric\u2019s memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she\u2019ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can\u2019t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that\u2019s all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she\u2019s been flying so badly.\u201d\n\nA slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron said, \u201cOne person can\u2019t feel all that at once, they\u2019d explode.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn\u2019t mean we all have,\u201d said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.\n\n\u201cShe was the one who started it,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve \u2014 she just sort of came at me \u2014 and next thing she\u2019s crying all over me \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what to do \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame you, mate,\u201d said Ron, looking alarmed at the very thought.\n\n\u201cYou just had to be nice to her,\u201d said Hermione, looking up anxiously. \u201cYou were, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up his face, \u201cI sort of \u2014 patted her on the back a bit.\u201d\n\nHermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling her eyes with extreme difficulty.\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose it could have been worse,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you going to see her again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to, won\u2019t I?\u201d said Harry. \u201cWe\u2019ve got D.A. meetings, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d said Hermione impatiently.\n\nHarry said nothing. Hermione\u2019s words opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibilities. He tried to imagine going somewhere with Cho \u2014 Hogsmeade, perhaps \u2014 and being alone with her for hours at a time. Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened. . . . The thought made his stomach clench painfully.\n\n\u201cOh well,\u201d said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more, \u201cyou\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t want to ask her?\u201d said Ron, who had been watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d said Hermione vaguely, \u201cHarry\u2019s liked her for ages, haven\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d\n\nHe did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re you writing the novel to anyway?\u201d Ron asked Hermione, trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor. Hermione hitched it up out of sight.\n\n\u201cViktor.\u201d\n\n\u201cKrum?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many other Viktors do we know?\u201d\n\nRon said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and sealing it, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than anything that Sirius\u2019s head would appear there and give him some advice about girls. But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they were, yet again, the last in the common room.\n\n\u201cWell, \u2019night,\u201d said Hermione, yawning widely, and she set off up the girls\u2019 staircase.\n\n\u201cWhat does she see in Krum?\u201d Ron demanded as he and Harry climbed the boys\u2019 stairs.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry, considering the matter, \u201cI s\u2019pose he\u2019s older, isn\u2019t he . . . and he\u2019s an international Quidditch player . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but apart from that,\u201d said Ron, sounding aggravated. \u201cI mean he\u2019s a grouchy git, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cBit grouchy, yeah,\u201d said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho.\n\nThey pulled off their robes and put on pajamas in silence; Dean, Seamus, and Neville were already asleep. Harry put his glasses on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed around his four-poster; instead he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Neville\u2019s bed. If he had known, this time last night, that in twenty-four hours\u2019 time he would have kissed Cho Chang . . .\n\n\u201c\u2019Night,\u201d grunted Ron, from somewhere to his right.\n\n\u201c\u2019Night,\u201d said Harry.\n\nMaybe next time . . . if there was a next time . . . she\u2019d be a bit happier. He ought to have asked her out; she had probably been expecting it and was now really angry with him . . . or was she lying in bed, still crying about Cedric? He did not know what to think. Hermione\u2019s explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand.\n\nThat\u2019s what they should teach us here, he thought, turning over onto his side, how girls\u2019 brains work . . . it\u2019d be more useful than Divination anyway. . . .\n\nNeville snuffled in his sleep. An owl hooted somewhere out in the night.\n\nHarry dreamed he was back in the D.A. room. Cho was accusing him of luring her there under false pretenses; she said that he had promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog cards if she showed up. Harry protested. . . . Cho shouted, \u201cCedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog cards, look!\u201d And she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside her robes and threw them into the air, and then turned into Hermione, who said, \u201cYou did promise her, you know, Harry. . . . I think you\u2019d better give her something else instead. . . . How about your Firebolt?\u201d And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his Firebolt because Umbridge had it, and anyway the whole thing was ridiculous, he\u2019d only come to the D.A. room to put up some Christmas baubles shaped like Dobby\u2019s head. . . .\n\nThe dream changed. . . .\n\nHis body felt smooth, powerful, and flexible. He was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone. . . . He was flat against the floor, sliding along on his belly. . . . It was dark, yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colors. . . . He was turning his head. . . . At first glance, the corridor was empty . . . but no . . . a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin drooping onto his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark. . . .\n\nHarry put out his tongue. . . . He tasted the man\u2019s scent on the air. . . . He was alive but drowsing . . . sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor . . .\n\nHarry longed to bite the man . . . but he must master the impulse. . . . He had more important work to do. . . .\n\nBut the man was stirring . . . a silvery cloak fell from his legs as he jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt. . . . He had no choice. . . . He reared high from the floor and struck once, twice, three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man\u2019s flesh, feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood. . . .\n\nThe man was yelling in pain . . . then he fell silent. . . . He slumped backward against the wall . . . Blood was splattering onto the floor . . .\n\nHis forehead hurt terribly. . . . It was aching fit to burst. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry! HARRY!\u201d\n\nHe opened his eyes. Every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat; his bedcovers were twisted all around him like a straitjacket; he felt as though a white-hot poker was being applied to his forehead.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d\n\nRon was standing over him looking extremely frightened. There were more figures at the foot of Harry\u2019s bed. He clutched his head in his hands; the pain was blinding him. . . . He rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really ill,\u201d said a scared voice. \u201cShould we call someone?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry!\u201d\n\nHe had to tell Ron, it was very important that he tell him. . . . Taking great gulps of air, Harry pushed himself up in bed, willing himself not to throw up again, the pain half-blinding him.\n\n\u201cYour dad,\u201d he panted, his chest heaving. \u201cYour dad\u2019s . . . been attacked . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron uncomprehendingly.\n\n\u201cYour dad! He\u2019s been bitten, it\u2019s serious, there was blood everywhere . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going for help,\u201d said the same scared voice, and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory.\n\n\u201cHarry, mate,\u201d said Ron uncertainly, \u201cyou . . . you were just dreaming . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Harry furiously; it was crucial that Ron understand. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream . . . not an ordinary dream. . . . I was there, I saw it. . . . I did it . . .\u201d\n\nHe could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. The pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly, though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly. He retched again and Ron leapt backward out of the way.\n\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019re not well,\u201d he said shakily. \u201cNeville\u2019s gone for help . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Harry choked, wiping his mouth on his pajamas and shaking uncontrollably. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me, it\u2019s your dad you\u2019ve got to worry about \u2014 we need to find out where he is \u2014 he\u2019s bleeding like mad \u2014 I was \u2014 it was a huge snake . . .\u201d\n\nHe tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it; Dean and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby. Whether one minute passed or ten, Harry did not know; he simply sat there shaking, feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar. . . . Then there were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs, and he heard Neville\u2019s voice again.\n\n\u201cOver here, Professor . . .\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown, her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Potter? Where does it hurt?\u201d\n\nHe had never been so pleased to see her; it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he needed now, not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Ron\u2019s dad,\u201d he said, sitting up again. \u201cHe\u2019s been attacked by a snake and it\u2019s serious, I saw it happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, you saw it happen?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, her dark eyebrows contracting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. . . . I was asleep and then I was there . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean you dreamed this?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Harry angrily. Would none of them understand? \u201cI was having a dream at first about something completely different, something stupid . . . and then this interrupted it. It was real, I didn\u2019t imagine it, Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone\u2019s got to find out where he is . . .\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not lying, and I\u2019m not mad!\u201d Harry told her, his voice rising to a shout. \u201cI tell you, I saw it happen!\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe you, Potter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall curtly. \u201cPut on your dressing-gown \u2014 we\u2019re going to see the headmaster.\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter22": "ST. MUNGO\u2019S HOSPITAL FOR MAGICAL MALADIES AND INJURIES\n\n\n\n\nHarry was so relieved that she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on his dressing gown, and pushed his glasses back onto his nose.\n\n\u201cWeasley, you ought to come too,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of Neville, Dean, and Seamus, out of the dormitory, down the spiral stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole, and off along the Fat Lady\u2019s moonlit corridor. Harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for Dumbledore. Mr. Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately, and what if those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think \u201cmy fangs\u201d) had been poisonous? They passed Mrs. Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly, but Professor McGonagall said, \u201cShoo!\u201d Mrs. Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cFizzing Whizbee,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\nThe gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously upward like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped onto the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud, and they were moving upward in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin.\n\nThough it was now well past midnight, there were voices coming from inside the room, a positive babble of them. It sounded as though Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people.\n\nProfessor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker, and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off. The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall led Harry and Ron inside.\n\nThe room was in half darkness; the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did. The portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames. Behind the door, a magnificent red-and-gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Professor McGonagall . . . and . . . ah.\u201d\n\nDumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him. He was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple-and-gold dressing gown over a snowy-white nightshirt, but seemed wide awake, his penetrating light-blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore, Potter has had a . . . well, a nightmare,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cHe says . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a nightmare,\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\nProfessor McGonagall looked around at Harry, frowning slightly.\n\n\u201cVery well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . well, I was asleep . . .\u201d said Harry and even in his terror and his desperation to make Dumbledore understand he felt slightly irritated that the headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his own interlocked fingers. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t an ordinary dream . . . it was real. . . . I saw it happen . . .\u201d He took a deep breath, \u201cRon\u2019s dad \u2014 Mr. Weasley \u2014 has been attacked by a giant snake.\u201d\n\nThe words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them, slightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.\n\n\u201cHow did you see this?\u201d Dumbledore asked quietly, still not looking at Harry.\n\n\u201cWell . . . I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry, rather angrily \u2014 what did it matter? \u201cInside my head, I suppose \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou misunderstand me,\u201d said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone. \u201cI mean . . . can you remember \u2014 er \u2014 where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?\u201d\n\nThis was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore; it was almost as though he knew . . .\n\n\u201cI was the snake,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw it all from the snake\u2019s point of view . . .\u201d\n\nNobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking at Ron, who was still whey-faced, said in a new and sharper voice, \u201cIs Arthur seriously injured?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry emphatically \u2014 why were they all so slow on the uptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side? And why could Dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him?\n\nBut Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry jumped, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling.\n\n\u201cEverard?\u201d he said sharply. \u201cAnd you too, Dilys!\u201d\n\nA sallow-faced wizard with short, black bangs and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes immediately.\n\n\u201cYou were listening?\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nThe wizard nodded, the witch said, \u201cNaturally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man has red hair and glasses,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cEverard, you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right people \u2014\u201d\n\nBoth nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighboring pictures (as usually happened at Hogwarts), neither reappeared; one frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair. Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at him under their eyelids, and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked.\n\n\u201cEverard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts\u2019s most celebrated Heads,\u201d Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron, and Professor McGonagall and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door. \u201cTheir renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important Wizarding institutions. As they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Mr. Weasley could be anywhere!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cPlease sit down, all three of you,\u201d said Dumbledore, as though Harry had not spoken. \u201cEverard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes. . . . Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra chairs . . .\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harry\u2019s hearing. Harry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkes\u2019s plumed golden head with one finger. The phoenix awoke immediately. He stretched his beautiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.\n\n\u201cWe will need,\u201d said Dumbledore very quietly to the bird, \u201ca warning.\u201d\n\nThere was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.\n\nDumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand.\n\nThe instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air. . . . A serpent\u2019s head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: He looked eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore did not look up.\n\n\u201cNaturally, naturally,\u201d murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise. \u201cBut in essence divided?\u201d\n\nHarry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: The clinking noise slowed and died, and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze, and vanished.\n\nDumbledore replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table; Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again. Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly.\n\n\u201cDumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat news?\u201d said Dumbledore at once.\n\n\u201cI yelled until someone came running,\u201d said the wizard, who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him, \u201csaid I\u2019d heard something moving downstairs \u2014 they weren\u2019t sure whether to believe me but went down to check \u2014 you know there are no portraits down there to watch from. Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later. He doesn\u2019t look good, he\u2019s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg\u2019s portrait to get a good view as they left \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement, \u201cI take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd moments later, the silver-ringletted witch had reappeared in her picture too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, \u201cYes, they\u2019ve taken him to St. Mungo\u2019s, Dumbledore. . . . They carried him past under my portrait. . . . He looks bad . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Dumbledore. He looked around at Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cMinerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course . . .\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door; Harry cast a sideways glance at Ron, who was now looking terrified.\n\n\u201cAnd Dumbledore \u2014 what about Molly?\u201d said Professor McGonagall, pausing at the door.\n\n\u201cThat will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut she may already know . . . that excellent clock of hers . . .\u201d\n\nHarry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley family members, and with a pang he thought that Mr. Weasley\u2019s hand must, even now, be pointing at \u201cmortal peril.\u201d But it was very late. . . . Mrs. Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock. . . . And he felt cold as he remembered Mrs. Weasley\u2019s boggart turning into Mr. Weasley\u2019s lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his face. . . . But Mr. Weasley wasn\u2019t going to die. . . . He couldn\u2019t. . . .\n\nDumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and Ron. He emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he placed carefully upon his desk. He raised his wand and murmured \u201cPortus\u201d; for a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue light, then it quivered to a rest, as solidly black as ever.\n\nDumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore\u2019s voice when he attempted to rouse him.\n\n\u201cPhineas. Phineas.\u201d\n\nAnd now the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their frames, the better to watch what was happening. When the clever-looking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his name too.\n\n\u201cPhineas! Phineas! PHINEAS!\u201d\n\nHe could not pretend any longer; he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide.\n\n\u201cDid someone call?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI\u2019ve got another message.\u201d\n\n\u201cVisit my other portrait?\u201d said Phineas in a reedy voice, giving a long, fake yawn (his eyes traveling around the room and focusing upon Harry). \u201cOh no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight . . .\u201d\n\nSomething about Phineas\u2019s voice was familiar to Harry. Where had he heard it before? But before he could think, the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest.\n\n\u201cInsubordination, sir!\u201d roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, brandishing his fists. \u201cDereliction of duty!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are honor-bound to give service to the present headmaster of Hogwarts!\u201d cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry recognized as Dumbledore\u2019s predecessor, Armando Dippet. \u201cShame on you, Phineas!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I persuade him, Dumbledore?\u201d called a gimlet-eyed witch, raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod.\n\n\u201cOh, very well,\u201d said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing this wand slightly apprehensively, \u201cthough he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he\u2019s done most of the family \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius knows not to destroy your portrait,\u201d said Dumbledore, and Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas\u2019s voice before: issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. \u201cYou are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife, children, and Harry Potter will be arriving at his house shortly. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter coming to stay,\u201d recited Phineas in a bored voice. \u201cYes, yes . . . very well . . .\u201d\n\nHe sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment that the study door opened again. Fred, George, and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all three of them looking disheveled and shocked, still in their night things.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Ginny, who looked frightened. \u201cProfessor McGonagall says you saw Dad hurt \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d said Dumbledore before Harry could speak. \u201cHe has been taken to St. Mungo\u2019s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I am sending you back to Sirius\u2019s house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than the Burrow. You will meet your mother there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re we going?\u201d asked Fred, looking shaken. \u201cFloo powder?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cFloo powder is not safe at the moment, the Network is being watched. You will be taking a Portkey.\u201d He indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk. \u201cWe are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back. . . . I wish to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office, leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor.\n\n\u201cIt is Fawkes\u2019s warning,\u201d said Dumbledore, catching the feather as it fell. \u201cShe must know you\u2019re out of your beds. . . . Minerva, go and head her off \u2014 tell her any story \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.\n\n\u201cHe says he\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his Slytherin banner. \u201cMy great-great-grandson has always had odd taste in houseguests . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome here, then,\u201d Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys. \u201cAnd quickly, before anyone else joins us . . .\u201d\n\nHarry and the others gathered around Dumbledore\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cYou have all used a Portkey before?\u201d asked Dumbledore, and they nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle. \u201cGood. On the count of three then . . . one . . . two . . .\u201d\n\nIt happened in a fraction of a second: In the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said \u201cthree,\u201d Harry looked up at him \u2014 they were very close together \u2014 and Dumbledore\u2019s clear blue gaze moved from the Portkey to Harry\u2019s face.\n\nAt once, Harry\u2019s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound had burst open again \u2014 and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that instant, that he would like nothing better than to strike \u2014 to bite \u2014 to sink his fangs into the man before him \u2014\n\n\u201c. . . three.\u201d\n\nHe felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind, the kettle pulling them onward and then \u2014\n\nHis feet hit the ground so hard that his knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said, \u201cBack again, the blood traitor brats, is it true their father\u2019s dying . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOUT!\u201d roared a second voice.\n\nHarry scrambled to his feet and looked around; they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place. The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle, which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall, looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth; Sirius was hurrying toward them all, looking anxious. He was unshaven and still in his day clothes; there was also a slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny up. \u201cPhineas Nigellus said Arthur\u2019s been badly injured \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk Harry,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cYeah, I want to hear this for myself,\u201d said George.\n\nThe twins and Ginny were staring at him. Kreacher\u2019s footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside.\n\n\u201cIt was \u2014\u201d Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore. \u201cI had a \u2014 a kind of \u2014 vision . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake\u2019s own eyes. . . . Ron, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not speak. When Harry had finished, Fred, George, and Ginny continued to stare at him for a moment. Harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks. Well, if they were going to blame him for just seeing the attack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time. . . .\n\n\u201cIs Mum here?\u201d said Fred, turning to Sirius.\n\n\u201cShe probably doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s happened yet,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cThe important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere. I expect Dumbledore\u2019s letting Molly know now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to St. Mungo\u2019s,\u201d said Ginny urgently. She looked around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pajamas. \u201cSirius, can you lend us cloaks or anything \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHang on, you can\u2019t go tearing off to St. Mungo\u2019s!\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course we can go to St. Mungo\u2019s if we want,\u201d said Fred, with a mulish expression, \u201che\u2019s our dad!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that matter?\u201d said George hotly.\n\n\u201cIt matters because we don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away!\u201d said Sirius angrily. \u201cHave you any idea what the Ministry would make of that information?\u201d\n\nFred and George looked as though they could not care less what the Ministry made of anything. Ron was still white-faced and silent. Ginny said, \u201cSomebody else could have told us. . . . We could have heard it somewhere other than Harry . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLike who?\u201d said Sirius impatiently. \u201cListen, your dad\u2019s been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you could seriously damage the Order\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care about the dumb Order!\u201d shouted Fred.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our dad dying we\u2019re talking about!\u201d yelled George.\n\n\u201cYour father knew what he was getting into, and he won\u2019t thank you for messing things up for the Order!\u201d said Sirius angrily in his turn. \u201cThis is how it is \u2014 this is why you\u2019re not in the Order \u2014 you don\u2019t understand \u2014 there are things worth dying for!\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy for you to say, stuck here!\u201d bellowed Fred. \u201cI don\u2019t see you risking your neck!\u201d\n\nThe little color remaining in Sirius\u2019s face drained from it. He looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, but we\u2019ve all got to act as though we don\u2019t know anything yet. We\u2019ve got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?\u201d\n\nFred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, however, took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it. Harry looked at Ron, who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug, and they sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute, then took seats on either side of Ginny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Sirius encouragingly, \u201ccome on, let\u2019s all . . . let\u2019s all have a drink while we\u2019re waiting. Accio Butterbeer!\u201d\n\nHe raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying toward them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the debris of Sirius\u2019s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them. They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table.\n\nHarry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands. His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. And it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that Mr. Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked Mr. Weasley in the first place. . . .\n\nDon\u2019t be stupid, you haven\u2019t got fangs, he told himself, trying to keep calm, though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking. You were lying in bed, you weren\u2019t attacking anyone. . . .\n\nBut then, what just happened in Dumbledore\u2019s office? he asked himself. I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore too. . . .\n\nHe put the bottle down on the table a little harder than he meant to, so that it slopped over onto the table. No one took any notice. Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a thud onto the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather.\n\n\u201cFawkes!\u201d said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. \u201cThat\u2019s not Dumbledore\u2019s writing \u2014 it must be a message from your mother \u2014 here \u2014\u201d\n\nHe thrust the letter into George\u2019s hand, who ripped it open and read aloud, \u201cDad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo\u2019s now. Stay where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum.\u201d\n\nGeorge looked around the table.\n\n\u201cStill alive . . .\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut that makes it sound . . .\u201d\n\nHe did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry too as though Mr. Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death. Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother\u2019s letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the parchment out of George\u2019s hands and read it for himself, then looked up at Harry, who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling.\n\nIf Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could not remember it. Sirius suggested once that they all go to bed, but without any real conviction, and the Weasleys\u2019 looks of disgust were answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, now and then raising bottles to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure one another that if there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs. Weasley must long since have arrived at St. Mungo\u2019s.\n\nFred fell into a doze, his head sagging sideways onto his shoulder. Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open; Harry could see them reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting with his head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell. And he and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon the family grief, waiting . . . waiting . . .\n\nAnd then, at ten past five in the morning by Ron\u2019s watch, the door swung open and Mrs. Weasley entered the kitchen. She was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her, Fred, Ron, and Harry half-rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d she said, her voice weak with tiredness. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping. We can all go and see him later. Bill\u2019s sitting with him now, he\u2019s going to take the morning off work.\u201d\n\nFred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face. George and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother, and hugged her. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in one.\n\n\u201cBreakfast!\u201d said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet. \u201cWhere\u2019s that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!\u201d\n\nBut Kreacher did not answer the summons.\n\n\u201cOh, forget it, then,\u201d muttered Sirius, counting the people in front of him. \u201cSo it\u2019s breakfast for \u2014 let\u2019s see \u2014 seven . . . Bacon and eggs, I think, and some tea, and toast \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry hurried over to the stove to help. He did not want to intrude upon the Weasleys\u2019 happiness, and he dreaded the moment when Mrs. Weasley would ask him to recount his vision. However, he had barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs. Weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what would have happened if it hadn\u2019t been for you, Harry,\u201d she said in a muffled voice. \u201cThey might not have found Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to you he\u2019s alive and Dumbledore\u2019s been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was, you\u2019ve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis . . .\u201d\n\nHarry could hardly stand her gratitude, but fortunately she soon released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night. Sirius said that he was very pleased to have been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as Mr. Weasley was in hospital.\n\n\u201cOh, Sirius, I\u2019m so grateful. . . . They think he\u2019ll be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer . . . Of course, that might mean we\u2019re here for Christmas . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more the merrier!\u201d said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that Mrs. Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron, and began to help with breakfast.\n\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer. \u201cCan I have a quick word? Er \u2014 now?\u201d\n\nHe walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without preamble Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had, including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mr. Weasley.\n\nWhen he paused for breath, Sirius said, \u201cDid you tell Dumbledore this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry impatiently, \u201cbut he didn\u2019t tell me what it meant. Well, he doesn\u2019t tell me anything anymore . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about,\u201d said Sirius steadily.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not all,\u201d said Harry in a voice only a little above a whisper. \u201cSirius, I . . . I think I\u2019m going mad. . . . Back in Dumbledore\u2019s office, just before we took the Portkey . . . for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one \u2014 my scar really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore \u2014 Sirius, I wanted to attack him \u2014\u201d\n\nHe could only see a sliver of Sirius\u2019s face; the rest was in darkness.\n\n\u201cIt must have been the aftermath of the vision, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cYou were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head. \u201cIt was like something rose up inside me, like there\u2019s a snake inside me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to sleep,\u201d said Sirius firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have breakfast and then go upstairs to bed, and then you can go and see Arthur after lunch with the others. You\u2019re in shock, Harry; you\u2019re blaming yourself for something you only witnessed, and it\u2019s lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died. Just stop worrying . . .\u201d\n\nHe clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving Harry standing alone in the dark.\n\n\nEveryone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. He went up to the bedroom he had shared with Ron over the summer, but while Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze, terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and awake to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house after one of the others. . . .\n\nWhen Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too. Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating lunch, so that they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo\u2019s. Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and they greeted Tonks and Mad-Eye, who had turned up to escort them across London, gleefully laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far less attention on the underground.\n\nTonks was very interested in Harry\u2019s vision of the attack on Mr. Weasley, something he was not remotely interested in discussing.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any Seer blood in your family, is there?\u201d she inquired curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart of the city.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling insulted.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Tonks musingly, \u201cno, I suppose it\u2019s not really prophecy you\u2019re doing, is it? I mean, you\u2019re not seeing the future, you\u2019re seeing the present. . . . It\u2019s odd, isn\u2019t it? Useful, though . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer; fortunately they got out at the next stop, a station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her up the escalator, Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat, clutching his wand. Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him; trying to deflect more questions about his dream he asked Mad-Eye where St. Mungo\u2019s was hidden.\n\n\u201cNot far from here,\u201d grunted Moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers. He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat. \u201cWasn\u2019t easy to find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn\u2019t have it underground like the Ministry \u2014 unhealthy. In the end they managed to get hold of a building up here. Theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd . . .\u201d\n\nHe seized Harry\u2019s shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets.\n\n\u201cHere we go,\u201d said Moody a moment later.\n\nThey had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red brick department store called Purge and Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew, standing at random and modeling fashions at least ten years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read CLOSED FOR REFURBISHMENT. Harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, \u201cIt\u2019s never open, that place . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Tonks, beckoning them forward to a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy whose false eyelashes were hanging off and who was modeling a green nylon pinafore dress. \u201cEverybody ready?\u201d\n\nThey nodded, clustering around her; Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy and said, her breath steaming up the glass, \u201cWotcher . . . We\u2019re here to see Arthur Weasley.\u201d\n\nFor a split second, Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking that quietly through a sheet of glass, when there were buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers. Then he reminded himself that dummies could not hear anyway. Next second his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod, beckoned its jointed finger, and Tonks had seized Ginny and Mrs. Weasley by the elbows, stepped right through the glass and vanished.\n\nFred, George, and Ron stepped after them; Harry glanced around at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.\u2019s, nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side.\n\nThere was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood. They had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies of Witch Weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises. A sweaty-faced witch in the center of the front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved, and with each clang his head vibrated horribly, so that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady.\n\nWitches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and down the rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like Umbridge\u2019s. Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests: a wand and bone, crossed.\n\n\u201cAre they doctors?\u201d he asked Ron quietly.\n\n\u201cDoctors?\u201d said Ron, looking startled. \u201cThose Muggle nutters that cut people up? Nah, they\u2019re Healers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver here!\u201d called Mrs. Weasley over the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked INQUIRIES. The wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like A CLEAN CAULDRON KEEPS POTIONS FROM BECOMING POISONS and ANTIDOTES ARE ANTI-DON\u2019TS UNLESS APPROVED BY A QUALIFIED HEALER.\n\nThere was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets that was labelled\n\nDILYS DERWENT\n\nST. MUNGO\u2019S HEALER 1722\u20131741\n\nHEADMISTRESS OF HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY, 1741\u20131768\n\n\n\nDilys was eyeing the Weasley party as though counting them; when Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink, walked sideways out of her portrait, and vanished.\n\nMeanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was performing an odd on-the-spot jig and trying, in between yelps of pain, to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s these \u2014 ouch \u2014 shoes my brother gave me \u2014 ow \u2014 they\u2019re eating my \u2014 OUCH \u2014 feet \u2014 look at them, there must be some kind of \u2014 AARGH \u2014 jinx on them and I can\u2019t \u2014 AAAAARGH \u2014 get them off \u2014\u201d\n\nHe hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals.\n\n\u201cThe shoes don\u2019t prevent you reading, do they?\u201d said the blonde witch irritably, pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk. \u201cYou want Spell Damage, fourth floor. Just like it says on the floor guide. Next!\u201d\n\nThe wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way, the Weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor guide:\n\n\n\nARTIFACT ACCIDENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Next!\u201d\n\nA harassed-looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out the back of her romper suit.\n\n\u201cFourth floor,\u201d said the witch in a bored voice, without asking, and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk, holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon. \u201cNext!\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley moved forward to the desk.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband, Arthur Weasley, was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur Weasley?\u201d said the witch, running her finger down a long list in front of her. \u201cYes, first floor, second door on the right, Dai Llewellyn ward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. \u201cCome on, you lot.\u201d\n\nThey followed through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling, looking like giant soapsuds. More witches and wizards in lime-green robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door, and every now and then they heard distant wailing. They climbed a flight of stairs and entered the \u201cCreature-Induced Injuries\u201d corridor, where the second door on the right bore the words \u201cDANGEROUS\u201d DAI LLEWELLYN WARD: SERIOUS BITES. Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wait outside, Molly,\u201d Tonks said. \u201cArthur won\u2019t want too many visitors at once. . . . It ought to be just the family first.\u201d\n\nMad-Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall, his magical eye spinning in all directions. Harry drew back too, but Mrs. Weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Harry, Arthur wants to thank you . . .\u201d\n\nThe ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door. Most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling. The walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather vicious-looking wizard on the wall, captioned URQUHART RACKHARROW, 1612\u20131697, INVENTOR OF THE ENTRAIL-EXPELLING CURSE.\n\nThere were only three patients. Mr. Weasley was occupying the bed at the far end of the ward beside the tiny window. Harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto his bed. He looked around as they walked toward him and, seeing whom it was, beamed.\n\n\u201cHello!\u201d he called, throwing the Prophet aside. \u201cBill just left, Molly, had to get back to work, but he says he\u2019ll drop in on you later . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you, Arthur?\u201d asked Mrs. Weasley, bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face. \u201cYou\u2019re still looking a bit peaky . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel absolutely fine,\u201d said Mr. Weasley brightly, holding out his good arm to give Ginny a hug. \u201cIf they could only take the bandages off, I\u2019d be fit to go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t they take them off, Dad?\u201d asked Fred.\n\n\u201cWell, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,\u201d said Mr. Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all. \u201cIt seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake\u2019s fangs that keeps wounds open. . . . They\u2019re sure they\u2019ll find an antidote, though, they say they\u2019ve had much worse cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,\u201d he said, dropping his voice and nodding toward the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling. \u201cBitten by a werewolf, poor chap. No cure at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cA werewolf?\u201d whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed. \u201cIs he safe in a public ward? Shouldn\u2019t he be in a private room?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two weeks till full moon,\u201d Mr. Weasley reminded her quietly. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know, trying to persuade him he\u2019ll be able to lead an almost normal life. I said to him \u2014 didn\u2019t mention names, of course \u2014 but I said I knew a werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite easy to manage . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d asked George.\n\n\u201cSaid he\u2019d give me another bite if I didn\u2019t shut up,\u201d said Mr. Weasley sadly. \u201cAnd that woman over there,\u201d he indicated the only other occupied bed, which was right beside the door, \u201cwon\u2019t tell the Healers what bit her, which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally. Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg, very nasty smell when they take off the dressings.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you going to tell us what happened, Dad?\u201d asked Fred, pulling his chair closer to the bed.\n\n\u201cWell, you already know, don\u2019t you?\u201d said Mr. Weasley, with a significant smile at Harry. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple \u2014 I\u2019d had a very long day, dozed off, got sneaked up on, and bitten.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it in the Prophet, you being attacked?\u201d asked Fred, indicating the newspaper Mr. Weasley had cast aside.\n\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile, \u201cthe Ministry wouldn\u2019t want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley warningly.\n\n\u201c\u2014 got \u2014 er \u2014 me,\u201d Mr. Weasley said hastily, though Harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say.\n\n\u201cSo where were you when it happened, Dad?\u201d asked George.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my business,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, though with a small smile. He snatched up the Daily Prophet, shook it open again and said, \u201cI was just reading about Willy Widdershins\u2019s arrest when you arrived. You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets last summer? One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded, and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you say you were \u2018on duty,\u2019\u201d Fred interrupted in a low voice, \u201cwhat were you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard your father,\u201d whispered Mrs. Weasley, \u201cwe are not discussing this here! Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t ask me how, but he actually got off on the toilet charge,\u201d said Mr. Weasley grimly. \u201cI can only suppose gold changed hands \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were guarding it, weren\u2019t you?\u201d said George quietly. \u201cThe weapon? The thing You-Know-Who\u2019s after?\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorge, be quiet!\u201d snapped Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d said Mr. Weasley in a raised voice, \u201cthis time Willy\u2019s been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo\u2019s for emergency bone regrowth and memory modification. Just think of it, Muggles in St. Mungo\u2019s! I wonder which ward they\u2019re in?\u201d\n\nAnd he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say You-Know-Who\u2019s got a snake, Harry?\u201d asked Fred, looking at his father for a reaction. \u201cA massive one? You saw it the night he returned, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley crossly. \u201cMad-Eye and Tonks are outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you. And you lot can wait outside,\u201d she added to her children and Harry. \u201cYou can come and say good-bye afterward. Go on . . .\u201d\n\nThey trooped back into the corridor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them. Fred raised his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, \u201cbe like that. Don\u2019t tell us anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking for these?\u201d said George, holding out what looked like a tangle of flesh-colored string.\n\n\u201cYou read my mind,\u201d said Fred, grinning. \u201cLet\u2019s see if St. Mungo\u2019s puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors, shall we?\u201d\n\nHe and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other. Fred and George handed them around. Harry hesitated to take one.\n\n\u201cGo on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad\u2019s life, if anyone\u2019s got the right to eavesdrop on him it\u2019s you . . .\u201d\n\nGrinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done.\n\n\u201cOkay, go!\u201d Fred whispered.\n\nThe flesh-colored strings wriggled like long skinny worms, then snaked under the door. For a few seconds Harry could hear nothing, then he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him.\n\n\u201c. . . they searched the whole area but they couldn\u2019t find the snake anywhere, it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur. . . . But You-Know-Who can\u2019t have expected a snake to get in, can he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI reckon he sent it as a lookout,\u201d growled Moody, \u201c\u2019cause he\u2019s not had any luck so far, has he? No, I reckon he\u2019s trying to get a clearer picture of what he\u2019s facing and if Arthur hadn\u2019t been there the beast would\u2019ve had much more time to look around. So Potter says he saw it all happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded rather uneasy. \u201cYou know, Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d said Moody, \u201cthere\u2019s something funny about the Potter kid, we all know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning,\u201d whispered Mrs. Weasley.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course he\u2019s worried,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cThe boy\u2019s seeing things from inside You-Know-Who\u2019s snake. . . . Obviously, Potter doesn\u2019t realize what that means, but if You-Know-Who\u2019s possessing him \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own, his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face. He looked around at the others. They were all staring at him, the strings still trailing from their ears, looking suddenly fearful."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter23": "CHRISTMAS ON THE CLOSED WARD\n\n\n\n\nWas this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry\u2019s eyes? Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them, afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet, with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell\u2019s head, and he ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull. . . .\n\nHe felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of Voldemort. . . . He had not merely seen the snake, he had been the snake, he knew it now. . . .\n\nAnd then a truly terrible thought occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents. . . .\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he after apart from followers?\u201d\n\n\u201cStuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn\u2019t have last time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I\u2019m the one Voldemort\u2019s trying to use, that\u2019s why they\u2019ve got guards around me everywhere I go, it\u2019s not for my protection, it\u2019s for other people\u2019s, only it\u2019s not working, they can\u2019t have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts. . . . I did attack Mr. Weasley last night, it was me, Voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now. . . .\n\n\u201cAre you all right, Harry, dear?\u201d whispered Mrs. Weasley, leaning across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel. \u201cYou don\u2019t look very well. Are you feeling sick?\u201d\n\nThey were all watching him. He shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance.\n\n\u201cHarry, dear, are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley in a worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place. \u201cYou look ever so pale. . . . Are you sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now, and you can have a couple of hours\u2019 sleep before dinner, all right?\u201d\n\nHe nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the front door he proceeded straight past the troll\u2019s leg umbrella stand and up the stairs and hurried into his and Ron\u2019s bedroom.\n\nHere he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas Nigellus\u2019s empty portrait, his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas. . . .\n\nHow had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus. . . . No, he couldn\u2019t be, he would know. . . . perhaps Voldemort was an Animagus . . . Yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into a snake of course . . . and when he\u2019s possessing me, then we both transform. . . . That still doesn\u2019t explain how come I got to London and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes, though. . . . But then Voldemort\u2019s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from Dumbledore, it\u2019s probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that. . . .\n\nAnd then, with a terrible stab of panic he thought, but this is insane \u2014 if Voldemort\u2019s possessing me, I\u2019m giving him a clear view into the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He\u2019ll know who\u2019s in the Order and where Sirius is . . . and I\u2019ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn\u2019t have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here. . . .\n\nThere was only one thing for it: He would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at least. . . . But no, that wouldn\u2019t do, there were still plenty of people at Hogwarts to maim and injure, what if it was Seamus, Dean, or Neville next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus\u2019s empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach. He had no alternative: He was going to have to return to Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely. . . .\n\nWell, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts \u2014 well, her cage would be one less thing to carry \u2014 he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway toward the door when a sneaky voice said, \u201cRunning away, are we?\u201d\n\nHe looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared upon the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with an amused expression on his face.\n\n\u201cNot running away, no,\u201d said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room.\n\n\u201cI thought,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard, \u201cthat to belong in Gryffindor House you were supposed to be brave? It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own House. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my own neck I\u2019m saving,\u201d said Harry tersely, tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in front of the door.\n\n\u201cOh I see,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard. \u201cThis is no cowardly flight \u2014 you are being noble.\u201d\n\nHarry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas Nigellus said lazily, \u201cI have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.\u201d\n\nHarry spun around.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cStay where you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t moved!\u201d said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob. \u201cSo what\u2019s the message?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have just given it to you, dolt,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus smoothly. \u201cDumbledore says, \u2018Stay where you are.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. \u201cWhy does he want me to stay? What else did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing whatsoever,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent.\n\nHarry\u2019s temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, and then terror again in the last twelve hours, and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s it, is it?\u201d he said loudly. \u201cStay there? That\u2019s all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors too! Just stay put while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won\u2019t bother telling you anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, \u201cthis is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore\u2019s orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is planning something to do with me, then?\u201d said Harry swiftly.\n\n\u201cDid I say that?\u201d said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves. \u201cNow, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than to listen to adolescent agonizing. . . . Good day to you . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he strolled into his frame and out of sight.\n\n\u201cFine, go then!\u201d Harry bellowed at the empty frame. \u201cAnd tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!\u201d\n\nThe empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself facedown upon the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching. . . .\n\nHe felt he had journeyed miles and miles. . . . It seemed impossible that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe. . . . He was so tired. . . . He was scared to sleep . . . yet he did not know how long he could fight it. . . . Dumbledore had told him to stay. . . . That must mean he was allowed to sleep. . . . But he was scared. . . . What if it happened again . . . ?\n\nHe was sinking into shadows. . . .\n\nIt was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start. He was walking down a deserted corridor toward a plain black door, past rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway onto a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left. . . .\n\nHe reached the black door but could not open it. . . . He stood gazing at it, desperate for entry. . . . Something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond. . . . A prize beyond his dreams. . . . If only his scar would stop prickling . . . then he would be able to think more clearly . . .\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice, from far, far away, \u201cMum says dinner\u2019s ready, but she\u2019ll save you something if you want to stay in bed . . .\u201d\n\nHarry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to be on his own with me, Harry thought. Not after what he heard Moody say . . .\n\nHe supposed none of them would want him there anymore now that they knew what was inside him. . . .\n\nHe would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company upon them. He turned over onto his other side and after a while dropped back off to sleep, waking much later in the early hours of the morning, with his insides aching with hunger, and Ron snoring in the next bed. Squinting around the room he saw the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch over him, in case he attacked somebody else.\n\nThe feeling of being unclean intensified. He half wished he had not obeyed Dumbledore and stayed. . . . If this was how life was going to be in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in Privet Drive after all.\n\n\nEverybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room where he was sitting alone, watching the sky outside the windows growing whiter, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs. Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he retreated farther upstairs and ignored her.\n\nIt was around six o\u2019clock in the evening that the doorbell rang and Mrs. Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hippogriff\u2019s room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed Buckbeak dead rats. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re in there,\u201d said Hermione\u2019s voice. \u201cWill you please come out? I want to talk to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Harry asked her, pulling open the door, as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any fragments of rat he might have dropped. \u201cI thought you were skiing with your mum and dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, to tell the truth, skiing\u2019s not really my thing,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cSo I\u2019ve come for Christmas.\u201d There was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell Ron that, I told him it\u2019s really good because he kept laughing so much. Anyway, Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I\u2019ve told them that everyone who\u2019s serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do well, they\u2019ll understand. Anyway,\u201d she said briskly, \u201clet\u2019s go to your bedroom, Ron\u2019s mum\u2019s lit a fire in there and she\u2019s sent up sandwiches.\u201d\n\nHarry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the bedroom he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting for them, sitting on Ron\u2019s bed.\n\n\u201cI came on the Knight Bus,\u201d said Hermione airily, pulling off her jacket before Harry had time to speak. \u201cDumbledore told me what had happened first thing yesterday morning, but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her Mr. Weasley was in St. Mungo\u2019s, and he\u2019d given you all permission to visit. So . . .\u201d\n\nShe sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron looked up at Harry.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Harry stiffly.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t lie, Harry,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cRon and Ginny say you\u2019ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. Mungo\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey do, do they?\u201d said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed.\n\n\u201cWell, you have!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t look at any of us!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s you lot who won\u2019t look at me!\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re taking it in turns to look and keep missing each other,\u201d suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching.\n\n\u201cVery funny,\u201d snapped Harry, turning away.\n\n\u201cOh, stop feeling all misunderstood,\u201d said Hermione sharply. \u201cLook, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside. \u201cAll been talking about me, have you? Well, I\u2019m getting used to it . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to talk to you, Harry,\u201d said Ginny, \u201cbut as you\u2019ve been hiding ever since we got back \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to talk to me,\u201d said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled.\n\n\u201cWell, that was a bit stupid of you,\u201d said Ginny angrily, \u201cseeing as you don\u2019t know anyone but me who\u2019s been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.\u201d\n\nHarry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he turned on the spot to face her.\n\n\u201cI forgot,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLucky you,\u201d said Ginny coolly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry said, and he meant it. \u201cSo . . . so do you think I\u2019m being possessed, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, can you remember everything you\u2019ve been doing?\u201d Ginny asked. \u201cAre there big blank periods where you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been up to?\u201d\n\nHarry racked his brains.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen You-Know-Who hasn\u2019t ever possessed you,\u201d said Ginny simply. \u201cWhen he did it to me, I couldn\u2019t remember what I\u2019d been doing for hours at a time. I\u2019d find myself somewhere and not know how I got there.\u201d\n\nHarry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself.\n\n\u201cThat dream I had about your dad and the snake, though \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019ve had these dreams before,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cYou had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was different,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head. \u201cI was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake. . . . What if Voldemort somehow transported me to London \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne day,\u201d said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated, \u201cyou\u2019ll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps that will remind you that you can\u2019t Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn\u2019t just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t leave your bed, mate,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI saw you thrashing around in your sleep about a minute before we could wake you up . . .\u201d\n\nHarry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense . . . Without really thinking he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth. . . .\n\nI\u2019m not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius tramping past their door toward Buckbeak\u2019s room, singing \u201cGod Rest Ye Merry, Hippogriffs\u201d at the top of his voice.\n\n\nHow could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius\u2019s delight at having the house full again, and especially at having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more, than they would have done at Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable. The tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius\u2019s family tree from view; and even the stuffed elf heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards.\n\nHarry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.\n\n\u201cGood haul this year,\u201d he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. \u201cThanks for the Broom Compass, it\u2019s excellent, beats Hermione\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s got me a homework planner \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione\u2019s handwriting on it. She had given him too a book that resembled a diary, except that it said things like \u201cDo it today or later you\u2019ll pay!\u201d every time he opened a page.\n\nSirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the D.A. Hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks\u2019s present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version; Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; and Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside down to see whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and George Apparated at the foot of his bed.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d said George. \u201cDon\u2019t go downstairs for a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cMum\u2019s crying again,\u201d said Fred heavily. \u201cPercy sent back his Christmas jumper.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a note,\u201d added George. \u201cHasn\u2019t asked how Dad is or visited him or anything . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried to comfort her,\u201d said Fred, moving around the bed to look at Harry\u2019s portrait. \u201cTold her Percy\u2019s nothing more than a humongous pile of rat droppings \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 didn\u2019t work,\u201d said George, helping himself to a Chocolate Frog. \u201cSo Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast, I reckon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to be anyway?\u201d asked Fred, squinting at Dobby\u2019s painting. \u201cLooks like a gibbon with two black eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Harry!\u201d said George, pointing at the back of the picture. \u201cSays so on the back!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood likeness,\u201d said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily, \u201cIf you\u2019ve dotted the i\u2019s and crossed the t\u2019s then you may do whatever you please!\u201d\n\nThey got up and dressed; they could hear various inhabitants of the house calling \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d to each other. On their way downstairs they met Hermione. \u201cThanks for the book, Harry!\u201d she said happily. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! And that perfume is really unusual, Ron.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWho\u2019s that for anyway?\u201d he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying.\n\n\u201cKreacher,\u201d said Hermione brightly.\n\n\u201cIt had better not be clothes!\u201d said Ron warningly. \u201cYou know what Sirius said, Kreacher knows too much, we can\u2019t set him free!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t clothes,\u201d said Hermione, \u201calthough if I had my way I\u2019d certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it\u2019s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat bedroom?\u201d said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cWell, Sirius says it\u2019s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of \u2014 den,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cApparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen.\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold when she wished them Merry Christmas, and they all averted their eyes.\n\n\u201cSo, this is Kreacher\u2019s bedroom?\u201d said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen open.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. \u201cEr . . . I think we\u2019d better knock . . .\u201d\n\nRon rapped the door with his knuckles but there was no reply.\n\n\u201cHe must be sneaking around upstairs,\u201d he said, and without further ado pulled open the door. \u201cUrgh.\u201d\n\nHarry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot\u2019s space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and moldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpielike, from Sirius\u2019s purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered haughtily up at him, including \u2014 he felt a little jolt in his stomach \u2014 the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was Kreacher\u2019s favorite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll just leave his present here,\u201d said Hermione, laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly. \u201cHe\u2019ll find it later, that\u2019ll be fine . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome to think of it,\u201d said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, \u201chas anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since the night we came back here,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou were ordering him out of the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . .\u201d said Sirius, frowning. \u201cYou know, I think that\u2019s the last time I saw him, too. . . . He must be hiding upstairs somewhere . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have left, could he?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI mean, when you said \u2018out,\u2019 maybe he thought you meant, get out of the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, house-elves can\u2019t leave unless they\u2019re given clothes, they\u2019re tied to their family\u2019s house,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cThey can leave the house if they really want to,\u201d Harry contradicted him. \u201cDobby did, he left the Malfoys\u2019 to give me warnings three years ago. He had to punish himself afterward, but he still managed it.\u201d\n\nSirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll look for him later, I expect I\u2019ll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother\u2019s old bloomers or something. . . . Of course, he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died. . . . But I mustn\u2019t get my hopes up . . .\u201d\n\nFred, George, and Ron laughed; Hermione, however, looked reproachful.\n\nOnce they had had their Christmas lunch, the Weasleys and Harry and Hermione were planning to pay Mr. Weasley another visit, escorted by Mad-Eye and Lupin. Mundungus turned up in time for Christmas pudding and trifle, having managed to \u201cborrow\u201d a car for the occasion, as the Underground did not run on Christmas Day. The car, which Harry doubted very much had been taken with the knowledge or consent of its owner, had had a similar Enlarging Spell put upon it as the Weasleys\u2019 old Ford Anglia; although normally proportioned outside, ten people with Mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably. Mrs. Weasley hesitated at the point of getting inside; Harry knew that her disapproval of Mundungus was battling with her dislike of traveling without magic; finally the cold outside and her children\u2019s pleading triumphed, and she settled herself into the backseat between Fred and Bill with good grace.\n\nThe journey to St. Mungo\u2019s was quite quick, as there was very little traffic on the roads. A small trickle of witches and wizards were creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital. Harry and the others got out of the car, and Mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them; they strolled casually toward the window where the dummy in green nylon stood, then, one by one, stepped through the glass.\n\nThe reception area looked pleasantly festive: The crystal orbs that illuminated St. Mungo\u2019s had been turned to red and gold so that they became gigantic, glowing Christmas baubles; holly hung around every doorway, and shining white Christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner, each topped with a gleaming gold star. It was less crowded than the last time they had been there, although halfway across the room Harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril.\n\n\u201cFamily argument, eh?\u201d smirked the blonde witch behind the desk. \u201cYou\u2019re the third I\u2019ve seen today . . . Spell Damage, fourth floor . . .\u201d\n\nThey found Mr. Weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray in his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face.\n\n\u201cEverything all right, Arthur?\u201d asked Mrs. Weasley, after they had all greeted Mr. Weasley and handed over their presents.\n\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, a little too heartily. \u201cYou \u2014 er \u2014 haven\u2019t seen Healer Smethwyck, have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley suspiciously, \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d said Mr. Weasley airily, starting to unwrap his pile of gifts. \u201cWell, everyone had a good day? What did you all get for Christmas? Oh, Harry \u2014 this is absolutely wonderful \u2014\u201d\n\nFor he had just opened Harry\u2019s gift of fuse-wire and screwdrivers. Mrs. Weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with Mr. Weasley\u2019s answer. As her husband leaned over to shake Harry\u2019s hand, she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt.\n\n\u201cArthur,\u201d she said, with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap, \u201cyou\u2019ve had your bandages changed. Why have you had your bandages changed a day early, Arthur? They told me they wouldn\u2019t need doing until tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Mr. Weasley, looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest. \u201cNo, no \u2014 it\u2019s nothing \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014\u201d\n\nHe seemed to deflate under Mrs. Weasley\u2019s piercing gaze.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 now don\u2019t get upset, Molly, but Augustus Pye had an idea. . . . He\u2019s the Trainee Healer, you know, lovely young chap and very interested in . . . um . . . complementary medicine. . . . I mean, some of these old Muggle remedies . . . well, they\u2019re called stitches, Molly, and they work very well on \u2014 on Muggle wounds \u2014\u201d\n\nMrs. Weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl. Lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt up to accompany him, grinning.\n\n\u201cDo you mean to tell me,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, \u201cthat you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot messing about, Molly, dear,\u201d said Mr. Weasley imploringly. \u201cIt was just \u2014 just something Pye and I thought we\u2019d try \u2014 only, most unfortunately \u2014 well, with these particular kinds of wounds \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem to work as well as we\u2019d hoped \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . well, I don\u2019t know whether you know what \u2014 what stitches are?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds as though you\u2019ve been trying to sew your skin back together,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter, \u201cbut even you, Arthur, wouldn\u2019t be that stupid \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI fancy a cup of tea too,\u201d said Harry, jumping to his feet.\n\nHermione, Ron, and Ginny almost sprinted to the door with him. As it swung closed behind them, they heard Mrs. Weasley shriek, \u201cWHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT\u2019S THE GENERAL IDEA?\u201d\n\n\u201cTypical Dad,\u201d said Ginny, shaking her head as they set off up the corridor. \u201cStitches . . . I ask you . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,\u201d said Hermione fairly. \u201cI suppose something in that snake\u2019s venom dissolves them or something. . . . I wonder where the tearoom is?\u201d\n\n\u201cFifth floor,\u201d said Harry, remembering the sign over the Welcome Witch\u2019s desk.\n\nThey walked along the corridor through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. As they climbed it, the various Healers called out to them, diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies. Ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit.\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that supposed to be?\u201d he asked angrily, as the Healer pursued him through six more portraits, shoving the occupants out of the way.\n\n\u201c\u2019Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin, young master, that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWatch who you\u2019re calling gruesome!\u201d said Ron, his ears turning red.\n\n\u201cThe only remedy is to take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about your throat, stand naked by the full moon in a barrel of eels\u2019 eyes \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not got spattergroit!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the unsightly blemishes upon your visage, young master \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re freckles!\u201d said Ron furiously. \u201cNow get back in your own picture and leave me alone!\u201d\n\nHe rounded on the others, who were all keeping determinedly straight faces.\n\n\u201cWhat floor\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the fifth,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s the fourth,\u201d said Harry, \u201cone more \u2014\u201d\n\nBut as he stepped onto the landing he came to an abrupt halt, staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted SPELL DAMAGE. A man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass. He had wavy blond hair, bright blue eyes, and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth.\n\n\u201cBlimey!\u201d said Ron, also staring at the man.\n\n\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d said Hermione suddenly, sounding breathless. \u201cProfessor Lockhart!\u201d\n\nTheir ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved toward them, wearing a long lilac dressing gown.\n\n\u201cWell, hello there!\u201d he said. \u201cI expect you\u2019d like my autograph, would you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t changed much, has he?\u201d Harry muttered to Ginny, who grinned.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 how are you, Professor?\u201d said Ron, sounding slightly guilty. It had been Ron\u2019s malfunctioning wand that had damaged Professor Lockhart\u2019s memory so badly that he had landed here in the first place, though, as Lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe Harry and Ron\u2019s memories at the time, Harry\u2019s sympathy was limited.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very well indeed, thank you!\u201d said Lockhart exuberantly, pulling a rather battered peacock-feather quill from his pocket. \u201cNow, how many autographs would you like? I can do joined-up writing now, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 we don\u2019t want any at the moment, thanks,\u201d said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who asked, \u201cProfessor, should you be wandering around the corridors? Shouldn\u2019t you be in a ward?\u201d\n\nThe smile faded slowly from Lockhart\u2019s face. For a few moments he gazed intently at Harry, then he said, \u201cHaven\u2019t we met?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . yeah, we have,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou used to teach us at Hogwarts, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach?\u201d repeated Lockhart, looking faintly unsettled. \u201cMe? Did I?\u201d\n\nAnd then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming. \u201cTaught you everything you know, I expect, did I? Well, how about those autographs, then? Shall we say a round dozen, you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out!\u201d\n\nBut just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice said, \u201cGilderoy, you naughty boy, where have you wandered off to?\u201d\n\nA motherly looking Healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor, smiling warmly at Harry and the others.\n\n\u201cOh Gilderoy, you\u2019ve got visitors! How lovely, and on Christmas Day too! Do you know, he never gets visitors, poor lamb, and I can\u2019t think why, he\u2019s such a sweetie, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing autographs!\u201d Gilderoy told the Healer with another glittering smile. \u201cThey want loads of them, won\u2019t take no for an answer! I just hope we\u2019ve got enough photographs!\u201d\n\n\u201cListen to him,\u201d said the Healer, taking Lockhart\u2019s arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious two-year-old. \u201cHe was rather well known a few years ago; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be coming back a little bit. Will you step this way? He\u2019s in a closed ward, you know, he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents, the door\u2019s usually kept locked . . . not that he\u2019s dangerous! But,\u201d she lowered her voice to a whisper, \u201cbit of a danger to himself, bless him. . . . Doesn\u2019t know who he is, you see, wanders off and can\u2019t remember how to get back. . . . It is nice of you to have come to see him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Ron, gesturing uselessly at the floor above, \u201cactually, we were just \u2014 er \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the Healer was smiling expectantly at them, and Ron\u2019s feeble mutter of \u201cgoing to have a cup of tea\u201d trailed away into nothingness. They looked at one another rather hopelessly and then followed Lockhart and his Healer along the corridor.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not stay long,\u201d Ron said quietly.\n\nThe Healer pointed her wand at the door of the Janus Thickey ward and muttered \u201cAlohomora.\u201d The door swung open and she led the way inside, keeping a firm grasp on Gilderoy\u2019s arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed.\n\n\u201cThis is our long-term resident ward,\u201d she informed Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny in a low voice. \u201cFor permanent spell damage, you know. Of course, with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck, we can produce some improvement. . . . Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself, and we\u2019ve seen a real improvement in Mr. Bode, he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well, though he isn\u2019t speaking any language we recognize yet. . . . Well, I must finish giving out the Christmas presents, I\u2019ll leave you all to chat . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked around; this ward bore unmistakable signs of being a permanent home to its residents. They had many more personal effects around their beds than in Mr. Weasley\u2019s ward; the wall around Gilderoy\u2019s headboard, for instance, was papered with pictures of himself, all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals. He had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed, childish writing. The moment he had been deposited in his chair by the Healer, Gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs toward him, seized a quill, and started signing them all feverishly.\n\n\u201cYou can put them in envelopes,\u201d he said to Ginny, throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them. \u201cI am not forgotten, you know, no, I still receive a very great deal of fan mail. . . . Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly. . . . I just wish I knew why . . .\u201d He paused, looking faintly puzzled, then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigor. \u201cI suspect it is simply my good looks . . .\u201d\n\nA sallow-skinned, mournful-looking wizard lay in the bed opposite, staring at the ceiling; he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him. Two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur; Harry remembered something similar happening to Hermione during their second year, although fortunately the damage, in her case, had not been permanent. At the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy.\n\n\u201cHere you are, Agnes,\u201d said the Healer brightly to the furry-faced woman, handing her a small pile of Christmas presents. \u201cSee, not forgotten, are you? And your son\u2019s sent an owl to say he\u2019s visiting tonight, so that\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nAgnes gave several loud barks.\n\n\u201cAnd look, Broderick, you\u2019ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month, they\u2019ll brighten things up, won\u2019t they?\u201d said the Healer, bustling along to the mumbling man, setting a rather ugly plant with long, swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand. \u201cAnd \u2014 oh, Mrs. Longbottom, are you leaving already?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s head spun round. The curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds: a formidable-looking old witch wearing a long green dress, a moth-eaten fox fur, and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakably a stuffed vulture and, trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed \u2014 Neville.\n\nWith a sudden rush of understanding, Harry realized who the people in the end beds must be. He cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned, but Ron had looked up at the sound of the name \u201cLongbottom\u201d too, and before Harry could stop him had called, \u201cNeville!\u201d\n\nNeville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s us, Neville!\u201d said Ron brightly, getting to his feet. \u201cHave you seen? Lockhart\u2019s here! Who\u2019ve you been visiting?\u201d\n\n\u201cFriends of yours, Neville, dear?\u201d said Neville\u2019s grandmother graciously, bearing down upon them all.\n\nNeville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here. A dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them.\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d said his grandmother, peering at Harry and sticking out a shriveled, clawlike hand for him to shake. \u201cYes, yes, I know who you are, of course. Neville speaks most highly of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 thanks,\u201d said Harry, shaking hands. Neville did not look at him, but stared at his own feet, the color deepening in his face all the while.\n\n\u201cAnd you two are clearly Weasleys,\u201d Mrs. Longbottom continued, proffering her hand regally to Ron and Ginny in turn. \u201cYes, I know your parents \u2014 not well, of course \u2014 but fine people, fine people . . . and you must be Hermione Granger?\u201d\n\nHermione looked rather startled that Mrs. Longbottom knew her name, but shook hands all the same.\n\n\u201cYes, Neville\u2019s told me all about you. Helped him out of a few sticky spots, haven\u2019t you? He\u2019s a good boy,\u201d she said, casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at Neville, \u201cbut he hasn\u2019t got his father\u2019s talent, I\u2019m afraid to say . . .\u201d And she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward, so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron, looking amazed (Harry wanted to stamp on Ron\u2019s foot, but that sort of thing was much harder to bring off unnoticed when you were wearing jeans rather than robes). \u201cIs that your dad down the end, Neville?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d said Mrs. Longbottom sharply. \u201cHaven\u2019t you told your friends about your parents, Neville?\u201d\n\nNeville took a deep breath, looked up at the ceiling, and shook his head. Harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone, but he could not think of any way of helping Neville out of the situation.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of!\u201d said Mrs. Longbottom angrily. \u201cYou should be proud, Neville, proud! They didn\u2019t give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed,\u201d said Neville very faintly, still looking anywhere but at Harry and the others. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got a funny way of showing it!\u201d said Mrs. Longbottom. \u201cMy son and his wife,\u201d she said, turning haughtily to Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, \u201cwere tortured into insanity by You-Know-Who\u2019s followers.\u201d\n\nHermione and Ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths. Ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of Neville\u2019s parents and looked mortified.\n\n\u201cThey were Aurors, you know, and very well respected within the Wizarding community,\u201d Mrs. Longbottom went on. \u201cHighly gifted, the pair of them. I \u2014 yes, Alice dear, what is it?\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress. She no longer had the plump, happy-looking face Harry had seen in Moody\u2019s old photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix. Her face was thin and worn now, her eyes seemed overlarge, and her hair, which had turned white, was wispy and dead-looking. She did not seem to want to speak, or perhaps she was not able to, but she made timid motions toward Neville, holding something in her outstretched hand.\n\n\u201cAgain?\u201d said Mrs. Longbottom, sounding slightly weary. \u201cVery well, Alice dear, very well \u2014 Neville, take it, whatever it is . . .\u201d\n\nBut Neville had already stretched out his hand, into which his mother dropped an empty Drooble\u2019s Blowing Gum wrapper.\n\n\u201cVery nice, dear,\u201d said Neville\u2019s grandmother in a falsely cheery voice, patting his mother on the shoulder. But Neville said quietly, \u201cThanks Mum.\u201d\n\nHis mother tottered away, back up the ward, humming to herself. Neville looked around at the others, his expression defiant, as though daring them to laugh, but Harry did not think he\u2019d ever found anything less funny in his life.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019d better get back,\u201d sighed Mrs. Longbottom, drawing on long green gloves. \u201cVery nice to have met you all. Neville, put that wrapper in the bin, she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now . . .\u201d\n\nBut as they left, Harry was sure he saw Neville slip the wrapper into his pocket.\n\nThe door closed behind them.\n\n\u201cI never knew,\u201d said Hermione, who looked tearful.\n\n\u201cNor did I,\u201d said Ron rather hoarsely.\n\n\u201cNor me,\u201d whispered Ginny.\n\nThey all looked at Harry.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said glumly. \u201cDumbledore told me but I promised I wouldn\u2019t mention it . . . that\u2019s what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for, using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville\u2019s parents until they lost their minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cBellatrix Lestrange did that?\u201d whispered Hermione, horrified. \u201cThat woman Kreacher\u2019s got a photo of in his den?\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence, broken by Lockhart\u2019s angry voice. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t learn joined-up writing for nothing, you know!\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter24": "OCCLUMENCY\n\n\n\n\nKreacher, it transpired, had been lurking in the attic. Sirius said he had found him up there, covered in dust, no doubt looking for more relics of the Black family to hide in his cupboard. Though Sirius seemed satisfied with this story, it made Harry uneasy. Kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance, his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat, and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual, though once or twice Harry caught the house-elf staring avidly at him, always looking quickly away when he saw that Harry had noticed.\n\nHarry did not mention his vague suspicions to Sirius, whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that Christmas was over. As the date of their departure back to Hogwarts drew nearer, he became more and more prone to what Mrs. Weasley called \u201cfits of the sullens,\u201d in which he would become taciturn and grumpy, often withdrawing to Buckbeak\u2019s room for hours at a time. His gloom seeped through the house, oozing under doorways like some noxious gas, so that all of them became infected by it.\n\nHarry did not want to leave Sirius all alone again with only Kreacher for company. In fact, for the first time in his life, he was not looking forward to returning to Hogwarts. Going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores Umbridge, who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence. Then there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned; there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer; Dumbledore remained as remote as ever; in fact, if it had not been for the D.A., Harry felt he might have gone to Sirius and begged him to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in Grimmauld Place.\n\nThen, on the very last day of the holidays, something happened that made Harry positively dread his return to school.\n\n\u201cHarry dear,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, poking her head into his and Ron\u2019s bedroom, where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by Hermione, Ginny, and Crookshanks, \u201ccould you come down to the kitchen? Professor Snape would like a word with you.\u201d\n\nHarry did not immediately register what she had said; one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of Ron\u2019s, and he was egging it on enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cSquash him \u2014 squash him, he\u2019s only a pawn, you idiot \u2014 sorry, Mrs. Weasley, what did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, dear. In the kitchen. He\u2019d like a word.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open in horror. He looked around at Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, all of whom were gaping back at him. Crookshanks, whom Hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour, leapt gleefully upon the board and set the pieces running for cover, squealing at the top of their voices.\n\n\u201cSnape?\u201d said Harry blankly.\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, dear,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley reprovingly. \u201cNow come on, quickly, he says he can\u2019t stay long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he want with you?\u201d said Ron, looking unnerved as Mrs. Weasley withdrew from the room.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything, have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Harry indignantly, racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make Snape pursue him to Grimmauld Place. Had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a T?\n\nHe pushed open the kitchen door a minute or two later to find Sirius and Snape both seated at the long kitchen table, glaring in opposite directions. The silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike. A letter lay open on the table in front of Sirius.\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry to announce his presence.\n\nSnape looked around at him, his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair.\n\n\u201cSit down, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Sirius loudly, leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling, \u201cI think I\u2019d prefer it if you didn\u2019t give orders here, Snape. It\u2019s my house, you see.\u201d\n\nAn ugly flush suffused Snape\u2019s pallid face. Harry sat down in a chair beside Sirius, facing Snape across the table.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to see you alone, Potter,\u201d said Snape, the familiar sneer curling his mouth, \u201cbut Black \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m his godfather,\u201d said Sirius, louder than ever.\n\n\u201cI am here on Dumbledore\u2019s orders,\u201d said Snape, whose voice, by contrast, was becoming more and more quietly waspish, \u201cbut by all means stay, Black, I know you like to feel . . . involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d said Sirius, letting his chair fall back onto all four legs with a loud bang.\n\n\u201cMerely that I am sure you must feel \u2014 ah \u2014 frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful,\u201d Snape laid a delicate stress on the word, \u201cfor the Order.\u201d\n\nIt was Sirius\u2019s turn to flush. Snape\u2019s lip curled in triumph as he turned to Harry.\n\n\u201cThe headmaster has sent me to tell you, Potter, that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudy what?\u201d said Harry blankly.\n\nSnape\u2019s sneer became more pronounced.\n\n\u201cOcclumency, Potter. The magical defense of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart began to pump very fast indeed. Defense against external penetration? But he was not being possessed, they had all agreed on that. . . .\n\n\u201cWhy do I have to study Occlu \u2014 thing?\u201d he blurted out.\n\n\u201cBecause the headmaster thinks it a good idea,\u201d said Snape smoothly. \u201cYou will receive private lessons once a week, but you will not tell anybody what you are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge. You understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWho\u2019s going to be teaching me?\u201d\n\nSnape raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting. Extra lessons with Snape \u2014 what on earth had he done to deserve this? He looked quickly around at Sirius for support.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t Dumbledore teach Harry?\u201d asked Sirius aggressively. \u201cWhy you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose because it is a headmaster\u2019s privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks,\u201d said Snape silkily. \u201cI assure you I did not beg for the job.\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cI will expect you at six o\u2019clock on Monday evening, Potter. My office. If anybody asks, you are taking Remedial Potions. Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them.\u201d\n\nHe turned to leave, his black traveling cloak billowing behind him.\n\n\u201cWait a moment,\u201d said Sirius, sitting up straighter in his chair.\n\nSnape turned back to face them, sneering.\n\n\u201cI am in rather a hurry, Black . . . unlike you, I do not have unlimited leisure time . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get to the point, then,\u201d said Sirius, standing up. He was rather taller than Snape who, Harry noticed, had balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what Harry was sure was the handle of his wand. \u201cIf I hear you\u2019re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you\u2019ll have me to answer to.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow touching,\u201d Snape sneered. \u201cBut surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I have,\u201d said Sirius proudly.\n\n\u201cWell then, you\u2019ll know he\u2019s so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him,\u201d Snape said sleekly.\n\nSirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table toward Snape, pulling out his wand as he went; Snape whipped out his own. They were squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, Snape calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius\u2019s wand-tip to his face.\n\n\u201cSirius!\u201d said Harry loudly, but Sirius appeared not to hear him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve warned you, Snivellus,\u201d said Sirius, his face barely a foot from Snape\u2019s, \u201cI don\u2019t care if Dumbledore thinks you\u2019ve reformed, I know better \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but why don\u2019t you tell him so?\u201d whispered Snape. \u201cOr are you afraid he might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother\u2019s house for six months very seriously?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me, how is Lucius Malfoy these days? I expect he\u2019s delighted his lapdog\u2019s working at Hogwarts, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of dogs,\u201d said Snape softly, \u201cdid you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside? Clever idea, Black, getting yourself seen on a safe station platform . . . gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nSirius raised his wand.\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d Harry yelled, vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them, \u201cSirius, don\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you calling me a coward?\u201d roared Sirius, trying to push Harry out of the way, but Harry would not budge.\n\n\u201cWhy, yes, I suppose I am,\u201d said Snape.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 get \u2014 out \u2014 of \u2014 it!\u201d snarled Sirius, pushing him out of the way with his free hand.\n\nThe kitchen door opened and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr. Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pajamas covered by a mackintosh.\n\n\u201cCured!\u201d he announced brightly to the kitchen at large. \u201cCompletely cured!\u201d\n\nHe and all the other Weasleys froze on the threshold, gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also suspended in mid-action, both Sirius and Snape looking toward the door with their wands pointing into each other\u2019s faces and Harry immobile between them, a hand stretched out to each of them, trying to force them apart.\n\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s beard,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, the smile sliding off his face, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d\n\nBoth Sirius and Snape lowered their wands. Harry looked from one to the other. Each wore an expression of utmost contempt, yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses. Snape pocketed his wand and swept back across the kitchen, passing the Weasleys without comment. At the door he looked back.\n\n\u201cSix o\u2019clock Monday evening, Potter.\u201d\n\nHe was gone. Sirius glared after him, his wand at his side.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s been going on?\u201d asked Mr. Weasley again.\n\n\u201cNothing, Arthur,\u201d said Sirius, who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance. \u201cJust a friendly little chat between two old school friends . . .\u201d With what looked like an enormous effort, he smiled. \u201cSo . . . you\u2019re cured? That\u2019s great news, really great . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, leading her husband forward into a chair. \u201cHealer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end, found an antidote to whatever that snake\u2019s got in its fangs, and Arthur\u2019s learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine, haven\u2019t you, dear?\u201d she added, rather menacingly.\n\n\u201cYes, Molly dear,\u201d said Mr. Weasley meekly.\n\nThat night\u2019s meal should have been a cheerful one with Mr. Weasley back amongst them; Harry could tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at Fred and George\u2019s jokes or offering everyone more food, his face fell back into a moody, brooding expression. Harry was separated from him by Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to offer Mr. Weasley their congratulations; he wanted to talk to Sirius, to tell him that he should not listen to a word Snape said, that Snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told him and remaining in Grimmauld Place, but he had no opportunity to do so, and wondered occasionally, eyeing the ugly look on Sirius\u2019s face, whether he would have dared to even if he had the chance. Instead he told Ron and Hermione under his voice about having to take Occlumency lessons with Snape.\n\n\u201cDumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort,\u201d said Hermione at once. \u201cWell, you won\u2019t be sorry not to have them anymore, will you?\u201d\n\n\u201cExtra lessons with Snape?\u201d said Ron, sounding aghast. \u201cI\u2019d rather have the nightmares!\u201d\n\nThey were to return to Hogwarts on the Knight Bus the following day, escorted once again by Tonks and Lupin, both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrived there next morning. The adults seemed to have been midway through a whispered conversation when the door opened; all of them looked around hastily and fell silent.\n\nAfter a hurried breakfast they pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly gray January morning. Harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest; he did not want to say good-bye to Sirius. He had a bad feeling about this parting; he did not know when they would next see each other and felt that it was incumbent upon him to say something to Sirius to stop him doing anything stupid \u2014 Harry was worried that Snape\u2019s accusation of cowardice had stung Sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place. Before he could think of what to say, however, Sirius had beckoned him to his side.\n\n\u201cI want you to take this,\u201d he said quietly, thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into Harry\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cA way of letting me know if Snape\u2019s giving you a hard time. No, don\u2019t open it in here!\u201d said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs. Weasley, who was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens. \u201cI doubt Molly would approve \u2014 but I want you to use it if you need me, all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket, but he knew he would never use whatever it was. It would not be he, Harry, who lured Sirius from his place of safety, no matter how foully Snape treated him in their forthcoming Occlumency classes.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d said Sirius, clapping Harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly, and before Harry could say anything else, they were heading upstairs, stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door, surrounded by Weasleys.\n\n\u201cGood-bye, Harry, take care,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, hugging him.\n\n\u201cSee you Harry, and keep an eye out for snakes for me!\u201d said Mr. Weasley genially, shaking his hand.\n\n\u201cRight \u2014 yeah,\u201d said Harry distractedly. It was his last chance to tell Sirius to be careful; he turned, looked into his godfather\u2019s face and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could do so Sirius was giving him a brief, one-armed hug. He said gruffly, \u201cLook after yourself, Harry,\u201d and next moment Harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air, with Tonks (today heavily disguised as a tall, tweedy woman with iron-gray hair) chivvying him down the steps.\n\nThe door of number twelve slammed shut behind them. They followed Lupin down the front steps. As he reached the pavement, Harry looked around. Number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of it stretched sideways, squeezing it out of sight; one blink later, it had gone.\n\n\u201cCome on, the quicker we get on the bus the better,\u201d said Tonks, and Harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square. Lupin flung out his right arm.\n\nBANG.\n\nA violently purple, triple-decker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them, narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost, which jumped backward out of its way.\n\nA thin, pimply, jug-eared youth in a purple uniform leapt down onto the pavement and said, \u201cWelcome to the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, we know, thank you,\u201d said Tonks swiftly. \u201cOn, on, get on \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd she shoved Harry forward toward the steps, past the conductor, who goggled at Harry as he passed.\n\n\u201c\u2019Ere \u2014 it\u2019s \u2019Arry \u2014 !\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion,\u201d muttered Tonks menacingly, now shunting Ginny and Hermione forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go on this thing,\u201d said Ron happily, joining Harry on board and looking around.\n\nIt had been evening the last time Harry had traveled by Knight Bus and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads. Now, in the early morning, it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows. Some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in Grimmauld Place; a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet, grumbling, and somebody\u2019s shopping bag had slid the length of the bus; an unpleasant mixture of frog spawn, cockroaches, and custard creams was scattered all over the floor.\n\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019ll have to split up,\u201d said Tonks briskly, looking around for empty chairs. \u201cFred, George, and Ginny, if you just take those seats at the back . . . Remus can stay with you . . .\u201d\n\nShe, Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded up to the very top deck, where there were two chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back. Stan Shunpike, the conductor, followed Harry and Ron eagerly to the back. Heads turned as Harry passed and when he sat down, he saw all the faces flick back to the front again.\n\nAs Harry and Ron handed Stan eleven Sickles each, the bus set off again, swaying ominously. It rumbled around Grimmauld Square, weaving on and off the pavement, then, with another tremendous BANG, they were all flung backward; Ron\u2019s chair toppled right over and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his lap, burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down upon Hermione\u2019s shoulder instead. Harry, who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket, looked out of the window: they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway.\n\n\u201cJust outside Birmingham,\u201d said Stan happily, answering Harry\u2019s unasked question as Ron struggled up from the floor. \u201cYou keepin\u2019 well, then, \u2019Arry? I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer, but it weren\u2019t never nuffink very nice. . . . I said to Ern, I said, \u2018\u2019e didn\u2019t seem like a nutter when we met \u2019im, just goes to show, dunnit?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe handed over their tickets and continued to gaze, enthralled, at Harry; apparently Stan did not care how nutty somebody was if they were famous enough to be in the paper. The Knight Bus swayed alarmingly, overtaking a line of cars on the inside. Looking toward the front of the bus Harry saw Hermione cover her eyes with her hands, Pigwidgeon still swaying happily on her shoulder.\n\nBANG.\n\nChairs slid backward again as the Knight Bus jumped from the Birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends. Hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they mounted the verges. From here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town, then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills, then to a windswept road between high-rise flats, each time with a loud BANG.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d muttered Ron, picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time, \u201cI never want to ride on here again.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, it\u2019s \u2019Ogwarts stop after this,\u201d said Stan brightly, swaying toward them. \u201cThat bossy woman up front \u2019oo got on with you, she\u2019s given us a little tip to move you up the queue. We\u2019re just gonna let Madam Marsh off first, though \u2014\u201d There was more retching from downstairs, followed by a horrible spattering sound. \u201cShe\u2019s not feeling \u2019er best.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later the Knight Bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub, which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision. They could hear Stan ushering the unfortunate Madam Marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck. The bus moved on again, gathering speed, until \u2014\n\nBANG.\n\nThey were rolling through a snowy Hogsmeade. Harry caught a glimpse of the Hog\u2019s Head down its side street, the severed boar\u2019s head sign creaking in the wintry wind. Flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus. At last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to Hogwarts.\n\nLupin and Tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage and then got off to say good-bye. Harry glanced up at the three decks of the Knight Bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them, noses flat against the windows.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe once you\u2019re in the grounds,\u201d said Tonks, casting a careful eye around at the deserted road. \u201cHave a good term, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook after yourselves,\u201d said Lupin, shaking hands all round and reaching Harry last. \u201cAnd listen . . .\u201d He lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged last-minute good-byes with Tonks, \u201cHarry, I know you don\u2019t like Snape, but he is a superb Occlumens and we all \u2014 Sirius included \u2014 want you to learn to protect yourself, so work hard, all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d said Harry heavily, looking up into Lupin\u2019s prematurely lined face. \u201cSee you, then . . .\u201d\n\nThe six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle dragging their trunks. Hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime. Harry glanced back when they reached the oak front doors; the Knight Bus had already gone, and he half-wished, given what was coming the following day, that he was still on board.\n\n\nHarry spent most of the next day dreading the evening. His morning Potions lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation, as Snape was as unpleasant as ever, and Harry\u2019s mood was further lowered by the fact that members of the D.A. were continually approaching him in the corridors between classes, asking hopefully whether there would be a meeting that night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when the next one is,\u201d Harry said over and over again, \u201cbut I can\u2019t do it tonight, I\u2019ve got to go to \u2014 er \u2014 Remedial Potions . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou take Remedial Potions?\u201d asked Zacharias Smith superciliously, having cornered Harry in the entrance hall after lunch. \u201cGood Lord, you must be terrible, Snape doesn\u2019t usually give extra lessons, does he?\u201d\n\nAs Smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion, Ron glared after him.\n\n\u201cShall I jinx him? I can still get him from here,\u201d he said, raising his wand and taking aim between Smith\u2019s shoulder blades.\n\n\u201cForget it,\u201d said Harry dismally. \u201cIt\u2019s what everyone\u2019s going to think, isn\u2019t it? That I\u2019m really stup \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Harry,\u201d said a voice behind him. He turned around and found Cho standing there.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably. \u201cHi.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be in the library, Harry,\u201d said Hermione firmly, and she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble staircase.\n\n\u201cHad a good Christmas?\u201d asked Cho.\n\n\u201cYeah, not bad,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cMine was pretty quiet,\u201d said Cho. For some reason, she was looking rather embarrassed. \u201cErm . . . there\u2019s another Hogsmeade trip next month, did you see the notice?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Oh no, I haven\u2019t checked the notice board since I got back . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s on Valentine\u2019s Day . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, wondering why she was telling him this. \u201cWell, I suppose you want to \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if you do,\u201d she said eagerly.\n\nHarry stared. He had been about to say \u201cI suppose you want to know when the next D.A. meeting is?\u201d but her response did not seem to fit.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 er \u2014\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t,\u201d she said, looking mortified. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I-I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d\n\nShe walked away. Harry stood staring after her, his brain working frantically. Then something clunked into place.\n\n\u201cCho! Hey \u2014 CHO!\u201d\n\nHe ran after her, catching her halfway up the marble staircase.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 d\u2019you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d\n\n\u201cOooh, yes!\u201d she said, blushing crimson and beaming at him.\n\n\u201cRight . . . well . . . that\u2019s settled then,\u201d said Harry, and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all, he headed off to the library to pick up Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons, walking in a rather bouncy way himself.\n\nBy six o\u2019clock that evening, however, even the glow of having successfully asked out Cho Chang was insufficient to lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step Harry took toward Snape\u2019s office.\n\nHe paused outside the door when he reached it, wishing he were almost anywhere else, then, taking a deep breath, knocked, and entered.\n\nIt was a shadowy room lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which floated slimy bits of animals and plants, suspended in variously colored potions. In a corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry \u2014 not without reason \u2014 of robbing. Harry\u2019s attention was drawn toward the desk, however, where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight. Harry recognized it at once \u2014 Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve. Wondering what on earth it was doing here, he jumped when Snape\u2019s cold voice came out of the corner.\n\n\u201cShut the door behind you, Potter.\u201d\n\nHarry did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself as he did so. When he turned back to face the room Snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk. Harry sat down and so did Snape, his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Harry, dislike etched in every line of his face.\n\n\u201cWell, Potter, you know why you are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency. I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than Potions.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry tersely.\n\n\u201cThis may not be an ordinary class, Potter,\u201d said Snape, his eyes narrowed malevolently, \u201cbut I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me \u2018sir\u2019 or \u2018Professor\u2019 at all times.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes . . . sir,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cNow, Occlumency. As I told you back in your dear godfather\u2019s kitchen, this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it, sir?\u201d said Harry, looking directly into Snape\u2019s dark, cold eyes and wondering whether he would answer.\n\nSnape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously, \u201cSurely even you could have worked that out by now, Potter? The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another person\u2019s mind \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can read minds?\u201d said Harry quickly, his worst fears confirmed.\n\n\u201cYou have no subtlety, Potter,\u201d said Snape, his dark eyes glittering. \u201cYou do not understand fine distinctions. It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker.\u201d\n\nSnape paused for a moment, apparently to savor the pleasure of insulting Harry, before continuing, \u201cOnly Muggles talk of \u2018mind reading.\u2019 The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by any invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing, Potter . . . or at least, most minds are . . .\u201d He smirked. \u201cIt is true, however, that those who have mastered Legilimency are able, under certain conditions, to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly. The Dark Lord, for instance, almost always knows when somebody is lying to him. Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie, and so utter falsehoods in his presence without detection.\u201d\n\nWhatever Snape said, Legilimency sounded like mind reading to Harry and he did not like the sound of it at all.\n\n\u201cSo he could know what we\u2019re thinking right now? Sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them,\u201d said Snape. \u201cTime and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, why do I have to learn Occlumency?\u201d\n\nSnape eyed Harry, tracing his mouth with one long, thin finger as he did so.\n\n\u201cThe usual rules do not seem to apply with you, Potter. The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord. The evidence suggests that at times, when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable \u2014 when you are asleep, for instance \u2014 you are sharing the Dark Lord\u2019s thoughts and emotions. The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue. He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart was pumping fast again. None of this added up.\n\n\u201cBut why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cI don\u2019t like it much, but it\u2019s been useful, hasn\u2019t it? I mean . . . I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I hadn\u2019t, Professor Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t have been able to save him, would he? Sir?\u201d\n\nSnape stared at Harry for a few moments, still tracing his mouth with his finger. When he spoke again, it was slowly and deliberately, as though he weighed every word.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently. Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser. However, the vision you had shortly before Christmas \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with the snake and Mr. Weasley?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not interrupt me, Potter,\u201d said Snape in a dangerous voice. \u201cAs I was saying . . . the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord\u2019s thoughts \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw inside the snake\u2019s head, not his!\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I just told you not to interrupt me, Potter?\u201d\n\nBut Harry did not care if Snape was angry; at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business. He had moved forward in his chair so that, without realizing it, he was perched on the very edge, tense as though poised for flight.\n\n\u201cHow come I saw through the snake\u2019s eyes if it\u2019s Voldemort\u2019s thoughts I\u2019m sharing?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not say the Dark Lord\u2019s name!\u201d spat Snape.\n\nThere was a nasty silence. They glared at each other across the Pensieve.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore says his name,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\n\u201cDumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard,\u201d Snape muttered. \u201cWhile he may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .\u201d He rubbed his left forearm, apparently unconsciously, on the spot where Harry knew the Dark Mark was burned into his skin.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to know,\u201d Harry began again, forcing his voice back to politeness, \u201cwhy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem to have visited the snake\u2019s mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment,\u201d snarled Snape. \u201cHe was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Vol \u2014 he \u2014 realized I was there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems so,\u201d said Snape coolly.\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d said Harry urgently. \u201cIs this just Professor Dumbledore guessing, or \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d said Snape, rigid in his chair, his eyes slits, \u201cto call me \u2018sir.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Harry impatiently, \u201cbut how do you know \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is enough that we know,\u201d said Snape repressively. \u201cThe important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings. He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse; that is to say, he has realized that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he might try and make me do things?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cSir?\u201d he added hurriedly.\n\n\u201cHe might,\u201d said Snape, sounding cold and unconcerned. \u201cWhich brings us back to Occlumency.\u201d\n\nSnape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and Harry tensed in his chair, but Snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair. When he withdrew it, some silvery substance came away, stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand, which broke as he pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into the Pensieve, where it swirled silvery white, neither gas nor liquid. Twice more Snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin, then, without offering any explanation of his behavior, he picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face Harry with his wand held at the ready.\n\n\u201cStand up and take out your wand, Potter.\u201d\n\nHarry got to his feet feeling nervous. They faced each other with the desk between them.\n\n\u201cYou may use your wand to attempt to disarm me, or defend yourself in any other way you can think of,\u201d said Snape.\n\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do?\u201d Harry asked, eyeing Snape\u2019s wand apprehensively.\n\n\u201cI am about to attempt to break into your mind,\u201d said Snape softly. \u201cWe are going to see how well you resist. I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse. . . . You will find that similar powers are needed for this. . . . Brace yourself, now. . . . Legilimens!\u201d\n\nSnape had struck before Harry was ready, before Harry had even begun to summon any force of resistance: the office swam in front of his eyes and vanished, image after image was racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings. . . .\n\nHe was five, watching Dudley riding a new red bicycle, and his heart was bursting with jealousy. . . . He was nine, and Ripper the bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the Dursleys were laughing below on the lawn. . . . He was sitting under the Sorting Hat, and it was telling him he would do well in Slytherin. . . . Hermione was lying in the hospital wing, her face covered with thick black hair. . . . A hundred dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake. . . . Cho Chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe. . . .\n\nNo, said a voice in Harry\u2019s head, as the memory of Cho drew nearer, you\u2019re not watching that, you\u2019re not watching it, it\u2019s private \u2014\n\nHe felt a sharp pain in his knee. Snape\u2019s office had come back into view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor; one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snape\u2019s desk. He looked up at Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist. There was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark.\n\n\u201cDid you mean to produce a Stinging Hex?\u201d asked Snape coolly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry bitterly, getting up from the floor.\n\n\u201cI thought not,\u201d said Snape contemptuously. \u201cYou let me get in too far. You lost control.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see everything I saw?\u201d Harry asked, unsure whether he wanted to hear the answer.\n\n\u201cFlashes of it,\u201d said Snape, his lip curling. \u201cTo whom did the dog belong?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Aunt Marge,\u201d Harry muttered, hating Snape.\n\n\u201cWell, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been,\u201d said Snape, raising his wand once more. \u201cYou managed to stop me eventually, though you wasted time and energy shouting. You must remain focused. Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d said Harry angrily, \u201cbut you\u2019re not telling me how!\u201d\n\n\u201cManners, Potter,\u201d said Snape dangerously. \u201cNow, I want you to close your eyes.\u201d\n\nHarry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told. He did not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while Snape faced him, carrying a wand.\n\n\u201cClear your mind, Potter,\u201d said Snape\u2019s cold voice. \u201cLet go of all emotion . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry\u2019s anger at Snape continued to pound through his veins like venom. Let go of his anger? He could as easily detach his legs . . .\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not doing it, Potter. . . . You will need more discipline than this. . . . Focus, now . . .\u201d\n\nHarry tried to empty his mind, tried not to think, or remember, or feel. . . .\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go again . . . on the count of three . . . one \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014 Legilimens!\u201d\n\nA great black dragon was rearing in front of him. . . . His father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror. . . . Cedric Diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him . . .\n\n\u201cNOOOOOOO!\u201d\n\nHe was on his knees again, his face buried in his hands, his brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull.\n\n\u201cGet up!\u201d said Snape sharply. \u201cGet up! You are not trying, you are making no effort, you are allowing me access to memories you fear, handing me weapons!\u201d\n\nHarry stood up again, his heart thumping wildly as though he had really just seen Cedric dead in the graveyard. Snape looked paler than usual, and angrier, though not nearly as angry as Harry was.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 am \u2014 making \u2014 an \u2014 effort,\u201d he said through clenched teeth.\n\n\u201cI told you to empty yourself of emotion!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? Well, I\u2019m finding that hard at the moment,\u201d Harry snarled.\n\n\u201cThen you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord!\u201d said Snape savagely. \u201cFools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily \u2014 weak people, in other words \u2014 they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not weak,\u201d said Harry in a low voice, fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack Snape in a moment.\n\n\u201cThen prove it! Master yourself!\u201d spat Snape. \u201cControl your anger, discipline your mind! We shall try again! Get ready, now! Legilimens!\u201d\n\nHe was watching Uncle Vernon hammering the letter box shut. . . . A hundred dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds toward him. . . . He was running along a windowless passage with Mr. Weasley. . . . They were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor. . . . Harry expected to go through it . . . but Mr. Weasley led him off to the left, down a flight of stone steps. . . .\n\n\u201cI KNOW! I KNOW!\u201d\n\nHe was on all fours again on Snape\u2019s office floor, his scar was prickling unpleasantly, but the voice that had just issued from his mouth was triumphant. He pushed himself up again to find Snape staring at him, his wand raised. It looked as though, this time, Snape had lifted the spell before Harry had even tried to fight back.\n\n\u201cWhat happened then, Potter?\u201d he asked, eyeing Harry intently.\n\n\u201cI saw \u2014 I remembered,\u201d Harry panted. \u201cI\u2019ve just realized . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRealized what?\u201d asked Snape sharply.\n\nHarry did not answer at once; he was still savoring the moment of blinding realization as he rubbed his forehead. . . .\n\nHe had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months, without once realizing that it was a real place. Now, seeing the memory again, he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with Mr. Weasley on the twelfth of August as they hurried to the courtrooms in the Ministry. It was the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries, and Mr. Weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by Voldemort\u2019s snake. . . .\n\nHe looked up at Snape.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the Department of Mysteries?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Snape asked quietly and Harry saw, with deep satisfaction, that Snape was unnerved.\n\n\u201cI said, what\u2019s in the Department of Mysteries, sir?\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cAnd why,\u201d said Snape slowly, \u201cwould you ask such a thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d said Harry, watching Snape closely for a reaction, \u201cthat corridor I\u2019ve just seen \u2014 I\u2019ve been dreaming about it for months \u2014 I\u2019ve just recognized it \u2014 it leads to the Department of Mysteries . . . and I think Voldemort wants something from \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI have told you not to say the Dark Lord\u2019s name!\u201d\n\nThey glared at each other. Harry\u2019s scar seared again, but he did not care. Snape looked agitated. When he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned.\n\n\u201cThere are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, few of which you would understand and none of which concern you, do I make myself plain?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said, still rubbing his prickling scar, which was becoming more painful.\n\n\u201cI want you back here same time on Wednesday, and we will continue work then.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Harry. He was desperate to get out of Snape\u2019s office and find Ron and Hermione.\n\n\u201cYou are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep \u2014 empty it, make it blank and calm, you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, who was barely listening.\n\n\u201cAnd be warned, Potter . . . I shall know if you have not practiced . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Harry mumbled. He picked up his schoolbag, swung it over his shoulder, and hurried toward the office door. As he opened it he glanced back at Snape, who had his back to Harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the Pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head. Harry left without another word, closing the door carefully behind him, his scar still throbbing painfully.\n\nHarry found Ron and Hermione in the library, where they were working on Umbridge\u2019s most recent ream of homework. Other students, nearly all of them fifth years, sat at lamp-lit tables nearby, noses close to books, quills scratching feverishly, while the sky outside the mullioned windows grew steadily blacker. The only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of Madam Pince\u2019s shoes as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly, breathing down the necks of those touching her precious books.\n\nHarry felt shivery; his scar was still aching, he felt almost feverish. When he sat down opposite Ron and Hermione he caught sight of himself in the window opposite. He was very white, and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual.\n\n\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Hermione whispered, and then, looking concerned, \u201cAre you all right, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . fine . . . I dunno,\u201d said Harry impatiently, wincing as pain shot through his scar again. \u201cListen . . . I\u2019ve just realized something . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he told them what he had just seen and deduced.\n\n\u201cSo . . . so, are you saying . . .\u201d whispered Ron, as Madam Pince swept past, squeaking slightly, \u201cthat the weapon \u2014 the thing You-Know-Who\u2019s after \u2014 is in the Ministry of Magic?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the Department of Mysteries, it\u2019s got to be,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cI saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and it\u2019s definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him.\u201d\n\nHermione let out a long, slow sigh. \u201cOf course,\u201d she breathed.\n\n\u201cOf course what?\u201d said Ron rather impatiently.\n\n\u201cRon, think about it. . . . Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic. . . . It must have been that one, it\u2019s too much of a coincidence!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come Sturgis was trying to break in when he\u2019s on our side?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Hermione admitted. \u201cThat is a bit odd . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s in the Department of Mysteries?\u201d Harry asked Ron. \u201cHas your dad ever mentioned anything about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know they call the people who work in there \u2018Unspeakables,\u2019\u201d said Ron, frowning. \u201cBecause no one really seems to know what they do in there. . . . Weird place to have a weapon . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not weird at all, it makes perfect sense,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cIt will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect. . . . Harry, are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d\n\nFor Harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . fine . . .\u201d he said, lowering his hands, which were trembling. \u201cI just feel a bit . . . I don\u2019t like Occlumency much . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect anyone would feel shaky if they\u2019d had their mind attacked over and over again,\u201d said Hermione sympathetically. \u201cLook, let\u2019s get back to the common room, we\u2019ll be a bit more comfortable there . . .\u201d\n\nBut the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement; Fred and George were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise.\n\n\u201cHeadless Hats!\u201d shouted George, as Fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students. \u201cTwo Galleons each \u2014 watch Fred, now!\u201d\n\nFred swept the hat onto his head, beaming. For a second he merely looked rather stupid, then both hat and head vanished.\n\nSeveral girls screamed, but everyone else was roaring with laughter.\n\n\u201cAnd off again!\u201d shouted George, and Fred\u2019s hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder; then his head reappeared as he swept the pink-feathered hat from it again.\n\n\u201cHow do those hats work, then?\u201d said Hermione, distracted from her homework and watching Fred and George. \u201cI mean, obviously it\u2019s some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it\u2019s rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object. . . . I\u2019d imagine the charm wouldn\u2019t have a very long life though . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer; he was still feeling ill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to do this tomorrow,\u201d he muttered, pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it.\n\n\u201cWell, write it in your homework planner then!\u201d said Hermione encouragingly. \u201cSo you don\u2019t forget!\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag, withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave it till later, you big second-rater!\u201d chided the book as Harry scribbled down Umbridge\u2019s homework. Hermione beamed at it.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed,\u201d said Harry, stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got.\n\nHe walked across the common room, dodging George, who tried to put a Headless Hat on him, and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys\u2019 dormitories. He was feeling sick again, just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake, but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right.\n\nHe opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head. He did not know where he was, whether he was standing or lying down, he did not even know his own name. . . .\n\nManiacal laughter was ringing in his ears. . . . He was happier than he had been in a very long time. . . . Jubilant, ecstatic, triumphant . . . A wonderful, wonderful thing had happened. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry? HARRY!\u201d\n\nSomeone had hit him around the face. The insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain. The happiness was draining out of him, but the laughter continued. . . .\n\nHe opened his eyes and as he did so, he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth. The moment he realized this, it died away; Harry lay panting on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly. Ron was bending over him, looking very worried.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI . . . dunno . . .\u201d Harry gasped, sitting up again. \u201cHe\u2019s really happy . . . really happy . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou-Know-Who is?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething good\u2019s happened,\u201d mumbled Harry. He was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack Mr. Weasley and felt very sick. \u201cSomething he\u2019s been hoping for.\u201d\n\nThe words came, just as they had back in the Gryffindor changing room, as though a stranger was speaking them through Harry\u2019s mouth, yet he knew they were true. He took deep breaths, willing himself not to vomit all over Ron. He was very glad that Dean and Seamus were not here to watch this time.\n\n\u201cHermione told me to come and check on you,\u201d said Ron in a low voice, helping Harry to his feet. \u201cShe says your defenses will be low at the moment, after Snape\u2019s been fiddling around with your mind. . . . Still, I suppose it\u2019ll help in the long run, won\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHe looked doubtfully at Harry as he helped him toward bed. Harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows, aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening, his scar still prickling painfully. He could not help feeling that his first foray into Occlumency had weakened his mind\u2019s resistance rather than strengthening it, and he wondered, with a feeling of great trepidation, what had happened to make Lord Voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter25": "THE BEETLE AT BAY\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s question was answered the very next morning. When Hermione\u2019s Daily Prophet arrived she smoothed it out, gazed for a moment at the front page, and then gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry and Ron together.\n\nFor an answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards\u2019 faces and the tenth, a witch\u2019s. Some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering; others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures, looking insolent. Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban.\n\nAntonin Dolohov, read the legend beneath a wizard with a long, pale, twisted face who was sneering up at Harry, convicted of the brutal murders of Gideon and Fabian Prewett.\n\nAugustus Rookwood, said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture, looking bored, convicted of leaking Ministry of Magic Secrets to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.\n\nBut Harry\u2019s eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he had seen it sleek, thick, and shining. She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but something \u2014 perhaps Azkaban \u2014 had taken most of her beauty.\n\nBellatrix Lestrange, convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of Frank and Alice Longbottom.\n\nHermione nudged Harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures, which Harry, concentrating on Bellatrix, had not yet read.\n\nMASS BREAKOUT FROM AZKABAN MINISTRY FEARS BLACK IS \u201cRALLYING POINT\u201d FOR OLD DEATH EATERS\n\n\n\n\u201cBlack?\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cNot \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cShhh!\u201d whispered Hermione desperately. \u201cNot so loud \u2014 just read it!\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in his private office, Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, confirmed that ten high-security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening, and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals.\n\n\u201cWe find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped,\u201d said Fudge last night. \u201cNor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated. An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help, and we must remember that Black, as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban, would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps. We think it likely that these individuals, who include Black\u2019s cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader. We are, however, doing all we can to round up the criminals and beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious. On no account should any of these individuals be approached.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere you are, Harry,\u201d said Ron, looking awestruck. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was happy last night . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this,\u201d snarled Harry, \u201cFudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat other options does he have?\u201d said Hermione bitterly. \u201cHe can hardly say, \u2018Sorry everyone, Dumbledore warned me this might happen, the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort\u2019 \u2014 stop whimpering, Ron \u2014 \u2018and now Voldemort\u2019s worst supporters have broken out too.\u2019 I mean, he\u2019s spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nHermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall. He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione. There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish, and outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemort\u2019s ranks. . . .\n\nHe glanced up at the staff table. It was a different story here: Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave. Professor Sprout had the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon. Meanwhile, at the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge. For once her pouchy toad\u2019s eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students. She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently.\n\n\u201cOh my \u2014\u201d said Hermione wonderingly, still staring at the newspaper.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said Harry quickly; he was feeling jumpy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . horrible,\u201d said Hermione, looking shaken. She folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it back to Harry and Ron.\n\nTRAGIC DEMISE OF MINISTRY OF MAGIC WORKER\n\nSt. Mungo\u2019s Hospital promised a full inquiry last night after Ministry of Magic worker Broderick Bode, 49, was discovered dead in his bed, strangled by a potted-plant. Healers called to the scene were unable to revive Mr. Bode, who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death.\n\nHealer Miriam Strout, who was in charge of Mr. Bode\u2019s ward at the time of the incident, has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday, but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement, \u201cSt. Mungo\u2019s deeply regrets the death of Mr. Bode, whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident.\n\n\u201cWe have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout, busy over the Christmas period, overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode\u2019s bedside table. As his speech and mobility improved, Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to look after the plant himself, unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom, but a cutting of Devil\u2019s Snare, which, when touched by the convalescent Mr. Bode, throttled him instantly.\n\n\u201cSt. Mungo\u2019s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBode . . .\u201d said Ron. \u201cBode. It rings a bell . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw him,\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cIn St. Mungo\u2019s, remember? He was in the bed opposite Lockhart\u2019s, just lying there, staring at the ceiling. And we saw the Devil\u2019s Snare arrive. She \u2014 the Healer \u2014 said it was a Christmas present . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked back at the story. A feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat.\n\n\u201cHow come we didn\u2019t recognize Devil\u2019s Snare . . . ? We\u2019ve seen it before . . . we could\u2019ve stopped this from happening . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWho expects Devil\u2019s Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a potted plant?\u201d said Ron sharply. \u201cIt\u2019s not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame! They must be a real prat, why didn\u2019t they check what they were buying?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come on, Ron!\u201d said Hermione shakily, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could put Devil\u2019s Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it? This \u2014 this was murder. . . . A clever murder, as well. . . . If the plant was sent anonymously, how\u2019s anyone ever going to find out who did it?\u201d\n\nHarry was not thinking about Devil\u2019s Snare. He was remembering taking the lift down to the ninth level of the Ministry on the day of his hearing, and the sallow-faced man who had got in on the Atrium level.\n\n\u201cI met Bode,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI saw him at the Ministry with your dad . . .\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s mouth fell open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard Dad talk about him at home! He was an Unspeakable \u2014 he worked in the Department of Mysteries!\u201d\n\nThey looked at one another for a moment, then Hermione pulled the newspaper back toward her, closed it, glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped Death Eaters on the front, then leapt to her feet.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d said Ron, startled.\n\n\u201cTo send a letter,\u201d said Hermione, swinging her bag onto her shoulder. \u201cIt . . . well, I don\u2019t know whether . . . but it\u2019s worth trying . . . and I\u2019m the only one who can . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate it when she does that,\u201d grumbled Ron as he and Harry got up from the table and made their own, slower way out of the Great Hall. \u201cWould it kill her to tell us what she\u2019s up to for once? It\u2019d take her about ten more seconds \u2014 hey, Hagrid!\u201d\n\nHagrid was standing beside the doors into the entrance hall, waiting for a crowd of Ravenclaws to pass. He was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose.\n\n\u201cAll righ\u2019, you two?\u201d he said, trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace.\n\n\u201cAre you okay, Hagrid?\u201d asked Harry, following him as he lumbered after the Ravenclaws.\n\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d said Hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness; he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightened-looking Professor Vector, who was passing. \u201cJus\u2019 busy, yeh know, usual stuff \u2014 lessons ter prepare \u2014 couple o\u2019 salamanders got scale rot \u2014 an\u2019 I\u2019m on probation,\u201d he mumbled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on probation?\u201d said Ron very loudly, so that many students passing looked around curiously. \u201cSorry \u2014 I mean \u2014 you\u2019re on probation?\u201d he whispered.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201c\u2019S\u2019no more\u2019n I expected, ter tell yeh the truth. Yeh migh\u2019 not\u2019ve picked up on it, bu\u2019 that inspection didn\u2019 go too well, yeh know . . . anyway,\u201d he sighed deeply. \u201cBes\u2019 go an rub a bit more chili powder on them salamanders or their tails\u2019ll be hangin\u2019 off \u2019em next. See yeh, Harry . . . Ron . . .\u201d\n\nHe trudged away, out the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds. Harry watched him go, wondering how much more bad news he could stand.\n\n\nThe fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry\u2019s indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful. As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St. Mungo\u2019s, Harry, Ron, and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers. Rumors were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had done.\n\nThose who came from Wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemort\u2019s; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort\u2019s reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, who had an uncle, aunt, and cousins who had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how you stand it, it\u2019s horrible,\u201d she said bluntly, dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of Screechsnap seedlings, causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort.\n\nIt was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers\u2019 voices. They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet\u2019s version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of Azkaban fortress. In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them, the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year.\n\nIt was not only the students\u2019 mood that had changed. It was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low, urgent whispers in the corridors, breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching.\n\n\u201cThey obviously can\u2019t talk freely in the staffroom anymore,\u201d said Hermione in a low voice, as she, Harry, and Ron passed Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout huddled together outside the Charms classroom one day. \u201cNot with Umbridge there.\u201d\n\n\u201cReckon they know anything new?\u201d said Ron, gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers.\n\n\u201cIf they do, we\u2019re not going to hear about it, are we?\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cNot after Decree . . . What number are we on now?\u201d\n\nFor new signs had appeared on the house notice boards the morning after news of the Azkaban breakout:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 BY ORDER OF \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe High Inquisitor of Hogwarts\n\n\n\n\nTeachers are hereby banned from giving students any information that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach.\n\n\n\nThe above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-six.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students. Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class.\n\n\u201cExploding Snap\u2019s got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor! That\u2019s not information relating to your subject!\u201d\n\nWhen Harry next saw Lee, the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly. Harry recommended essence of murtlap.\n\nHarry had thought that the breakout from Azkaban might have humbled Umbridge a little, that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under her beloved Fudge\u2019s nose. It seemed, however, to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at Hogwarts under her personal control. She seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long, and the only question was whether it would be Professor Trelawney or Hagrid who went first.\n\nEvery single Divination and Care of Magical Creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of Umbridge and her clipboard. She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting Professor Trelawney\u2019s increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about Ornithomancy and Heptomology, insisting that she predict students\u2019 answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves, and the rune stones in turn. Harry thought that Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain; several times he passed her in the corridors (in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room), muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands, and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, all the time giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry. If he had not been so worried about Hagrid, he would have felt sorry for her \u2014 but if one of them was to be ousted out of a job, there could be only one choice for Harry as to who should remain.\n\nUnfortunately, Harry could not see that Hagrid was putting up a better show than Trelawney. Though he seemed to be following Hermione\u2019s advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a crup, a creature indistinguishable from a Jack Russell terrier except for its forked tail, since before Christmas, he also seemed to have lost his nerve. He was oddly distracted and jumpy in lessons, losing the thread of what he was saying while talking to the class, answering questions wrongly and glancing anxiously at Umbridge all the time. He was also more distant with Harry, Ron, and Hermione than he had ever been before, expressly forbidding them to visit him after dark.\n\n\u201cIf she catches yeh, it\u2019ll be all of our necks on the line,\u201d he told them flatly, and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized his job further, they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings.\n\nIt seemed to Harry that Umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at Hogwarts worth living: visits to Hagrid\u2019s house, letters from Sirius, his Firebolt, and Quidditch. He took his revenge the only way he had: redoubling his efforts for the D.A.\n\nHarry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville. The news of his parents\u2019 attacker\u2019s escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, Ron, and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo\u2019s, and taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers\u2019 escape; in fact, he barely spoke during D.A. meetings anymore, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and countercurse Harry taught them, his plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents, working harder than anyone else in the room. He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm, a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker, only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.\n\nIn fact Harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at Occlumency as Neville was making during D.A. meetings. Harry\u2019s sessions with Snape, which had started badly enough, were not improving; on the contrary, Harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson.\n\nBefore he had started studying Occlumency, his scar had prickled occasionally, usually during the night, or else following one of those strange flashes of Voldemort\u2019s thoughts or moods that he experienced every now and then. Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort\u2019s mood, and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor toward the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams that always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a bit like an illness,\u201d said Hermione, looking concerned when Harry confided in her and Ron. \u201cA fever or something. It has to get worse before it gets better.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lessons with Snape that are making it worse,\u201d said Harry flatly. \u201cI\u2019m getting sick of my scar hurting, and I\u2019m getting bored walking down that corridor every night.\u201d He rubbed his forehead angrily. \u201cI just wish the door would open, I\u2019m sick of standing staring at it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d said Hermione sharply. \u201cDumbledore doesn\u2019t want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn\u2019t have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You\u2019re just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am working!\u201d said Harry, nettled. \u201cYou try it sometime, Snape trying to get inside your head, it\u2019s not a bundle of laughs, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe . . .\u201d said Ron slowly.\n\n\u201cMaybe what?\u201d said Hermione rather snappishly.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not Harry\u2019s fault he can\u2019t close his mind,\u201d said Ron darkly.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe Snape isn\u2019t really trying to help Harry . . .\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione stared at him. Ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said again in a lower voice, \u201che\u2019s actually trying to open Harry\u2019s mind a bit wider . . . make it easier for You-Know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, Ron,\u201d said Hermione angrily. \u201cHow many times have you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe used to be a Death Eater,\u201d said Ron stubbornly. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve never seen proof that he really swapped sides . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore trusts him,\u201d Hermione repeated. \u201cAnd if we can\u2019t trust Dumbledore, we can\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d\n\n\nWith so much to worry about and so much to do \u2014 startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the fifth years working until past midnight, secret D.A. meetings, and regular classes with Snape \u2014 January seemed to be passing alarmingly fast. Before Harry knew it, February had arrived, bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second Hogsmeade visit of the year. Harry had had very little time to spare on conversations with Cho since they had agreed to visit the village together, but suddenly found himself facing a Valentine\u2019s Day spent entirely in her company.\n\nOn the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully. He and Ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls. Hedwig was not there \u2014 not that he had expected her \u2014 but Hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down.\n\n\u201cAnd about time! If it hadn\u2019t come today . . .\u201d she said eagerly, tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment. Her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face.\n\n\u201cListen, Harry,\u201d she said, looking up at him. \u201cThis is really important. . . . Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . I dunno,\u201d said Harry dubiously. \u201cCho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her. We never said what we were going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, bring her along if you must,\u201d said Hermione urgently. \u201cBut will you come?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . all right, but why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got time to tell you now, I\u2019ve got to answer this quickly \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd she hurried out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of uneaten toast in the other.\n\n\u201cAre you coming?\u201d Harry asked Ron, but he shook his head, looking glum.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come into Hogsmeade at all, Angelina wants a full day\u2019s training. Like it\u2019s going to help \u2014 we\u2019re the worst team I\u2019ve ever seen. You should see Sloper and Kirke, they\u2019re pathetic, even worse than I am.\u201d He heaved a great sigh. \u201cI dunno why Angelina won\u2019t just let me resign . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re good when you\u2019re on form, that\u2019s why,\u201d said Harry irritably.\n\nHe found it very hard to be sympathetic to Ron\u2019s plight when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against Hufflepuff. Ron seemed to notice Harry\u2019s tone, because he did not mention Quidditch again during breakfast, and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said good-bye to each other shortly afterward. Ron departed for the Quidditch pitch and Harry, after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon, proceeded alone to the entrance hall to meet Cho, feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about.\n\nShe was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors, looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long ponytail. Harry\u2019s feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked toward her, and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they looked swinging at his sides.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Cho slightly breathlessly.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Harry.\n\nThey stared at each other for a moment, then Harry said, \u201cWell \u2014 er \u2014 shall we go, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh \u2014 yes . . .\u201d\n\nThey joined the queue of people being signed out by Filch, occasionally catching each other\u2019s eye and grinning shiftily, but not talking to each other. Harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air, finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand there looking awkward. It was a fresh, breezy sort of day and as they passed the Quidditch stadium, Harry glimpsed Ron and Ginny skimming over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them. . . .\n\n\u201cYou really miss it, don\u2019t you?\u201d said Cho.\n\nHe looked around and saw her watching him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d sighed Harry. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember the first time we played against each other?\u201d she asked him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, grinning. \u201cYou kept blocking me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to,\u201d said Cho, smiling reminiscently. \u201cI heard he got taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, it was Puddlemere United, I saw him at the World Cup last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I saw you there too, remember? We were on the same campsite. It was really good, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe subject of the Quidditch World Cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates. Harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to her, no more difficult, in fact, than talking to Ron and Hermione, and he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of Slytherin girls passed them, including Pansy Parkinson.\n\n\u201cPotter and Chang!\u201d screeched Pansy to a chorus of snide giggles. \u201cUrgh, Chang, I don\u2019t think much of your taste. . . . At least Diggory was good-looking!\u201d\n\nThey sped up, talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at Harry and Cho, leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake. Harry could think of nothing else to say about Quidditch, and Cho, slightly flushed, was watching her feet.\n\n\u201cSo . . . where d\u2019you want to go?\u201d Harry asked as they entered Hogsmeade. The High Street was full of students ambling up and down, peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements.\n\n\u201cOh . . . I don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Cho, shrugging. \u201cUm . . . shall we just have a look in the shops or something?\u201d\n\nThey wandered toward Dervish and Banges. A large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few Hogsmeaders were looking at it. They moved aside when Harry and Cho approached and Harry found himself staring once more at the ten pictures of the escaped Death Eaters. The poster (\u201cBy Order of the Ministry of Magic\u201d) offered a thousand-Galleon reward to any witch or wizard with information relating to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it,\u201d said Cho in a low voice, also gazing up at the pictures of the Death Eaters. \u201cRemember when that Sirius Black escaped, and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there aren\u2019t dementors anywhere . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, tearing his eyes away from Bellatrix Lestrange\u2019s face to glance up and down the High Street. \u201cYeah, it is weird . . .\u201d\n\nHe was not sorry that there were no dementors nearby, but now he came to think of it, their absence was highly significant. They had not only let the Death Eaters escape, they were not bothering to look for them. . . . It looked as though they really were outside Ministry control now.\n\nThe ten escaped Death Eaters were staring out of every shop window he and Cho passed. It started to rain as they passed Scrivenshaft\u2019s; cold, heavy drops of water kept hitting Harry\u2019s face and the back of his neck.\n\n\u201cUm . . . d\u2019you want to get a coffee?\u201d said Cho tentatively, as the rain began to fall more heavily.\n\n\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d said Harry, looking around. \u201cWhere \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s a really nice place just up here, haven\u2019t you ever been to Madam Puddifoot\u2019s?\u201d she said brightly, and she led him up a side road and into a small tea shop that Harry had never noticed before. It was a cramped, steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows. Harry was reminded unpleasantly of Umbridge\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cCute, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Cho happily.\n\n\u201cEr . . . yeah,\u201d said Harry untruthfully.\n\n\u201cLook, she\u2019s decorated it for Valentine\u2019s Day!\u201d said Cho, indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small, circular tables, occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants.\n\n\u201cAaah . . .\u201d\n\nThey sat down at the last remaining table, which was situated in the steamy window. Roger Davies, the Ravenclaw Quidditch Captain, was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl. They were holding hands. The sight made Harry feel uncomfortable, particularly when, looking around the tea shop, he saw that it was full of nothing but couples, all of them holding hands. Perhaps Cho would expect him to hold her hand.\n\n\u201cWhat can I get you, m\u2019dears?\u201d said Madam Puddifoot, a very stout woman with a shiny black bun, squeezing between their table and Roger Davies\u2019s with great difficulty.\n\n\u201cTwo coffees, please,\u201d said Cho.\n\nIn the time it took for their coffees to arrive, Roger Davies and his girlfriend started kissing over their sugar bowl. Harry wished they wouldn\u2019t; he felt that Davies was setting a standard with which Cho would soon expect him to compete. He felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window, but it was so steamed up he could not see the street outside. To postpone the moment when he had to look at Cho he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub.\n\nAfter a few more painful minutes Cho mentioned Umbridge; Harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her, but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during D.A. meetings it did not last very long. Silence fell again. Harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say.\n\n\u201cEr . . . listen, d\u2019you want to come with me to the Three Broomsticks at lunchtime? I\u2019m meeting Hermione Granger there.\u201d\n\nCho raised her eyebrows.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re meeting Hermione Granger? Today?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Well, she asked me to, so I thought I would. D\u2019you want to come with me? She said it wouldn\u2019t matter if you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh . . . well . . . that was nice of her.\u201d\n\nBut Cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all; on the contrary, her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding.\n\nA few more minutes passed in total silence, Harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup. Next door, Roger Davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together by the lips.\n\nCho\u2019s hand was lying on the table beside her coffee, and Harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it. Just do it, he told himself, as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest. Just reach out and grab it. . . . Amazing how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than to snatch a speeding Snitch from midair . . .\n\nBut just as he moved his hand forward, Cho took hers off the table. She was now watching Roger Davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression.\n\n\u201cHe asked me out, you know,\u201d she said in a quiet voice. \u201cA couple of weeks ago. Roger. I turned him down, though.\u201d\n\nHarry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table, could not think why she was telling him this. If she wished she were sitting at the table next door being heartily kissed by Roger Davies, why had she agreed to come out with him?\n\nHe said nothing. Their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them; some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee Harry had been about to drink.\n\n\u201cI came in here with Cedric last year,\u201d said Cho.\n\nIn the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, Harry\u2019s insides had become glacial. He could not believe she wanted to talk about Cedric now, while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads.\n\nCho\u2019s voice was rather higher when she spoke again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to ask you for ages. . . . Did Cedric \u2014 did he m-m-mention me at all before he died?\u201d\n\nThis was the very last subject on earth Harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with Cho.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 no \u2014\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThere \u2014 there wasn\u2019t time for him to say anything. Erm . . . so . . . d\u2019you . . . d\u2019you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays? You support the Tornados, right?\u201d\n\nHis voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. To his horror, he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again, just as they had been after the last D.A. meeting before Christmas.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said desperately, leaning in so that nobody else could overhear, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about Cedric right now. . . . Let\u2019s talk about something else . . .\u201d\n\nBut this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.\n\n\u201cI thought,\u201d she said, tears spattering down onto the table. \u201cI thought you\u2019d u-u-understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n-need to talk about it t-too! I mean, you saw it happen, d-didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nEverything was going nightmarishly wrong; Roger Davies\u2019 girlfriend had even unglued herself to look around at Cho crying.\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 I have talked about it,\u201d Harry said in a whisper, \u201cto Ron and Hermione, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ll talk to Hermione Granger!\u201d she said shrilly, her face now shining with tears, and several more kissing couples broke apart to stare. \u201cBut you won\u2019t talk to me! P-perhaps it would be best if we just . . . just p-paid and you went and met up with Hermione G-Granger, like you obviously want to!\u201d\n\nHarry stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it.\n\n\u201cCho?\u201d he said weakly, wishing Roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and Cho.\n\n\u201cGo on, leave!\u201d she said, now crying into the napkin. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you asked me out in the first place if you\u2019re going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me. . . . How many are you meeting after Hermione?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that!\u201d said Harry, and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed, which he realized a split second too late was a mistake.\n\nCho sprang to her feet. The whole tearoom was quiet, and everybody was watching them now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you around, Harry,\u201d she said dramatically, and hiccuping slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open, and hurried off into the pouring rain.\n\n\u201cCho!\u201d Harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle.\n\nThere was total silence within the tea shop. Every eye was upon Harry. He threw a Galleon down onto the table, shook pink confetti out of his eyes, and followed Cho out of the door.\n\nIt was raining hard now, and she was nowhere to be seen. He simply did not understand what had happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine.\n\n\u201cWomen!\u201d he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with his hands in his pockets. \u201cWhat did she want to talk about Cedric for anyway? Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe?\u201d\n\nHe turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the Three Broomsticks. He knew he was too early to meet Hermione, but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time. He shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. Hagrid was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose.\n\n\u201cHi, Hagrid!\u201d he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him.\n\nHagrid jumped and looked down at Harry as though he barely recognized him. Harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Harry,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cYou all righ\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d lied Harry; in fact, next to this battered and mournful-looking Hagrid, he felt he did not have much to complain about. \u201cEr \u2014 are you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m grand, Harry, grand . . .\u201d\n\nHe gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed. Harry did not know what to say to him. They sat side by side in silence for a moment. Then Hagrid said abruptly, \u201cIn the same boat, you an\u2019 me, aren\u2019 we, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . I\u2019ve said it before. . . . Both outsiders, like,\u201d said Hagrid, nodding wisely. \u201cAn\u2019 both orphans. Yeah . . . both orphans.\u201d\n\nHe took a great swig from his tankard.\n\n\u201cMakes a diff\u2019rence, havin\u2019 a decent family,\u201d he said. \u201cMe dad was decent. An\u2019 your mum an\u2019 dad were decent. If they\u2019d lived, life woulda bin diff\u2019rent, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . I s\u2019pose,\u201d said Harry cautiously. Hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood.\n\n\u201cFamily,\u201d said Hagrid gloomily. \u201cWhatever yeh say, blood\u2019s important . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Harry, unable to stop himself, \u201cwhere are you getting all these injuries?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d said Hagrid, looking startled. \u201cWha\u2019 injuries?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those!\u201d said Harry, pointing at Hagrid\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cOh . . . tha\u2019s jus\u2019 normal bumps an\u2019 bruises, Harry,\u201d said Hagrid dismissively. \u201cI got a rough job.\u201d\n\nHe drained his tankard, set it back upon the table, and got to his feet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be seein\u2019 yeh, Harry. . . . Take care now . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disappeared into the torrential rain. Harry watched him go, feeling miserable. Hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he seemed determined not to accept help. What was going on? But before Harry could think about the matter any further, he heard a voice calling his name.\n\n\u201cHarry! Harry, over here!\u201d\n\nHermione was waving at him from the other side of the room. He got up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub. He was still a few tables away when he realized that Hermione was not alone; she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined: Luna Lovegood and none other than Rita Skeeter, ex-journalist on the Daily Prophet and one of Hermione\u2019s least favorite people in the world.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re early!\u201d said Hermione, moving along to give him room to sit down. \u201cI thought you were with Cho, I wasn\u2019t expecting you for another hour at least!\u201d\n\n\u201cCho?\u201d said Rita at once, twisting around in her seat to stare avidly at Harry. \u201cA girl?\u201d\n\nShe snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business if Harry\u2019s been with a hundred girls,\u201d Hermione told Rita coolly. \u201cSo you can put that away right now.\u201d\n\nRita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid-green quill from her bag. Looking as though she had been forced to swallow Stinksap, she snapped her bag shut again.\n\n\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d Harry asked, sitting down and staring from Rita to Luna to Hermione.\n\n\u201cLittle Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived,\u201d said Rita, taking a large slurp of her drink. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m allowed to talk to him, am I?\u201d she shot at Hermione.\n\n\u201cYes, I suppose you are,\u201d said Hermione coldly.\n\nUnemployment did not suit Rita. The hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face. The scarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses. She took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth, \u201cPretty girl, is she, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne more word about Harry\u2019s love life and the deal\u2019s off and that\u2019s a promise,\u201d said Hermione irritably.\n\n\u201cWhat deal?\u201d said Rita, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. \u201cYou haven\u2019t mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy, you just told me to turn up. Oh, one of these days . . .\u201d She took a deep shuddering breath.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, one of these days you\u2019ll write more horrible stories about Harry and me,\u201d said Hermione indifferently. \u201cFind someone who cares, why don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help,\u201d said Rita, shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, \u201cHow has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe feels angry, of course,\u201d said Hermione in a hard, clear voice. \u201cBecause he\u2019s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister\u2019s too much of an idiot to believe him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you actually stick to it, do you, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?\u201d said Rita, lowering her glass and subjecting Harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag. \u201cYou stand by all this garbage Dumbledore\u2019s been telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t the sole witness,\u201d snarled Harry. \u201cThere were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love them,\u201d breathed Rita, now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. \u201cA great bold headline: \u2018Potter Accuses . . .\u2019 A subheading: \u2018Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.\u2019 And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you: \u2018Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Who\u2019s attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being Death Eaters . . .\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Quick-Quotes Quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face.\n\n\u201cBut of course,\u201d she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at Hermione, \u201cLittle Miss Perfect wouldn\u2019t want that story out there, would she?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d said Hermione sweetly, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.\u201d\n\nRita stared at her. So did Harry. Luna, on the other hand, sang, \u201cWeasley Is Our King\u201d dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick.\n\n\u201cYou want me to report what he says about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\u201d Rita asked Hermione in a hushed voice.\n\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cThe true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry reports them. He\u2019ll give you all the details, he\u2019ll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he\u2019ll tell you what Voldemort looks like now \u2014 oh, get a grip on yourself,\u201d she added contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for at the sound of Voldemort\u2019s name, Rita had jumped so badly that she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself.\n\nRita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at Hermione. Then she said baldly, \u201cThe Prophet wouldn\u2019t print it. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull story. Everyone thinks he\u2019s delusional. Now, if you let me write the story from that angle \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need another story about how Harry\u2019s lost his marbles!\u201d said Hermione angrily. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of those already, thank you! I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no market for a story like that,\u201d said Rita coldly.\n\n\u201cYou mean the Prophet won\u2019t print it because Fudge won\u2019t let them,\u201d said Hermione irritably.\n\nRita gave Hermione a long, hard look. Then, leaning forward across the table toward her, she said in a businesslike tone, \u201cAll right, Fudge is leaning on the Prophet, but it comes to the same thing. They won\u2019t print a story that shows Harry in a good light. Nobody wants to read it. It\u2019s against the public mood. This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough. People just don\u2019t want to believe You-Know-Who\u2019s back.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it?\u201d said Hermione scathingly.\n\nRita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of firewhisky.\n\n\u201cThe Prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl,\u201d she said coldly.\n\n\u201cMy dad thinks it\u2019s an awful paper,\u201d said Luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly. Sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at Rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad eyes. \u201cHe publishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know. He doesn\u2019t care about making money.\u201d\n\nRita looked disparagingly at Luna.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter?\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Twenty-five Ways to Mingle with Muggles\u2019 and the dates of the next Bring-and-Fly Sale?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Luna, dipping her onion back into her gillywater, \u201che\u2019s the editor of The Quibbler.\u201d\n\nRita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked around in alarm.\n\n\u201c\u2018Important stories he thinks the public needs to know\u2019?\u201d she said witheringly. \u201cI could manure my garden with the contents of that rag.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hermione pleasantly. \u201cLuna says her father\u2019s quite happy to take Harry\u2019s interview. That\u2019s who\u2019ll be publishing it.\u201d\n\nRita stared at them both for a moment and then let out a great whoop of laughter.\n\n\u201cThe Quibbler!\u201d she said, cackling. \u201cYou think people will take him seriously if he\u2019s published in The Quibbler?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people won\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione in a level voice. \u201cBut the Daily Prophet\u2019s version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it. I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there isn\u2019t a better explanation of what happened, and if there\u2019s an alternative story available, even if it is published in a\u201d \u2014 she glanced sideways at Luna, \u201cin a \u2014 well, an unusual magazine \u2014 I think they might be rather keen to read it.\u201d\n\nRita did not say anything for a while, but eyed Hermione shrewdly, her head a little to one side.\n\n\u201cAll right, let\u2019s say for a moment I\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cWhat kind of fee am I going to get?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine,\u201d said Luna dreamily. \u201cThey do it because it\u2019s an honor, and, of course, to see their names in print.\u201d\n\nRita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to do this for free?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink. \u201cOtherwise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider\u2019s account of life in Azkaban . . .\u201d\n\nRita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of Hermione\u2019s drink and thrust it up her nose.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ve got any choice, have I?\u201d said Rita, her voice shaking slightly. She opened her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a piece of parchment, and raised her Quick-Quotes Quill.\n\n\u201cDaddy will be pleased,\u201d said Luna brightly. A muscle twitched in Rita\u2019s jaw.\n\n\u201cOkay, Harry?\u201d said Hermione, turning to him. \u201cReady to tell the public the truth?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Harry, watching Rita balancing the Quick-Quotes Quill at the ready on the parchment between them.\n\n\u201cFire away, then, Rita,\u201d said Hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out of the bottom of her glass."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter26": "SEEN AND UNFORESEEN\n\n\n\n\nLuna said vaguely that she did not know how soon Rita\u2019s interview with Harry would appear in The Quibbler, that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. \u201cAnd, of course, that\u2019ll be a very important story, so Harry\u2019s might have to wait for the following issue,\u201d said Luna.\n\nHarry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when Voldemort had returned. Rita had pressed him for every little detail, and he had given her everything he could remember, knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth. He wondered how people would react to the story. He guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane, not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks. But the breakout of Bellatrix Lestrange and her fellow Death Eaters had given Harry a burning desire to do something, whether it worked or not. . . .\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public,\u201d said Dean, sounding awestruck at dinner on Monday night. Seamus was shoveling down large amounts of chicken-and-ham pie on Dean\u2019s other side, but Harry knew he was listening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, Harry,\u201d said Neville, who was sitting opposite him. He was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, \u201cIt must have been . . . tough . . . talking about it. . . . Was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d mumbled Harry, \u201cbut people have got to know what Voldemort\u2019s capable of, haven\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Neville, nodding, \u201cand his Death Eaters too . . . People should know . . .\u201d\n\nNeville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato. Seamus looked up, but when he caught Harry\u2019s eye he looked quickly back at his plate again. After a while Dean, Seamus, and Neville departed for the common room, leaving Harry and Hermione at the table waiting for Ron, who had not yet had dinner because of Quidditch practice.\n\nCho Chang walked into the hall with her friend Marietta. Harry\u2019s stomach gave an unpleasant lurch, but she did not look over at the Gryffindor table and sat down with her back to him.\n\n\u201cOh, I forgot to ask you,\u201d said Hermione brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, \u201cwhat happened on your date with Cho? How come you were back so early?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . well, it was . . .\u201d said Harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble toward him and helping himself to seconds, \u201ca complete fiasco, now you mention it.\u201d\n\nAnd he told her what had happened in Madam Puddifoot\u2019s Tea Shop.\n\n\u201c. . . so then,\u201d he finished several minutes later, as the final bit of crumble disappeared, \u201cshe jumps up, right, and says \u2018I\u2019ll see you around, Harry,\u2019 and runs out of the place!\u201d He put down his spoon and looked at Hermione. \u201cI mean, what was all that about? What was going on?\u201d\n\nHermione glanced over at the back of Cho\u2019s head and sighed. \u201cOh, Harry,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry, but you were a bit tactless.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, tactless?\u201d said Harry, outraged. \u201cOne minute we were getting on fine, next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her out, and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea shop \u2014 how was I supposed to feel about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you see,\u201d said Hermione, with the patient air of one explaining that one plus one equals two to an overemotional toddler, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, but,\u201d spluttered Harry, \u201cbut \u2014 you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without telling her \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should have told her differently,\u201d said Hermione, still with that maddeningly patient air. \u201cYou should have said it was really annoying, but I\u2019d made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn\u2019t want to go, you\u2019d much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you, and hopefully you\u2019d be able to get away more quickly? And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too,\u201d Hermione added as an afterthought.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ugly,\u201d said Harry, bemused.\n\nHermione laughed.\n\n\u201cHarry, you\u2019re worse than Ron. . . . Well, no, you\u2019re not,\u201d she sighed, as Ron himself came stumping into the Hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy. \u201cLook \u2014 you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous. It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that what she was doing?\u201d said Harry as Ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach toward himself. \u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t it have been easier if she\u2019d just asked me whether I liked her better than you?\u201d\n\n\u201cGirls don\u2019t often ask questions like that,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWell, they should!\u201d said Harry forcefully. \u201cThen I could\u2019ve just told her I fancy her, and she wouldn\u2019t have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying what she did was sensible,\u201d said Hermione, as Ginny joined them, just as muddy as Ron and looking equally disgruntled. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should write a book,\u201d Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes, \u201ctranslating mad things girls do so boys can understand them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry fervently, looking over at the Ravenclaw table. Cho had just got up; still not looking at him, she left the Great Hall. Feeling rather depressed, he looked back at Ron and Ginny. \u201cSo, how was Quidditch practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a nightmare,\u201d said Ron in a surly voice.\n\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d said Hermione, looking at Ginny, \u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it was,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cIt was appalling. Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it.\u201d\n\nRon and Ginny went off for baths after dinner; Harry and Hermione returned to the busy Gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework. Harry had been struggling with a new star chart for Astronomy for half an hour when Fred and George turned up.\n\n\u201cRon and Ginny not here?\u201d asked Fred, looking around as he pulled up a chair and, when Harry shook his head, he said, \u201cGood. We were watching their practice. They\u2019re going to be slaughtered. They\u2019re complete rubbish without us.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, Ginny\u2019s not bad,\u201d said George fairly, sitting down next to Fred. \u201cActually, I dunno how she got so good, seeing how we never let her play with us . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren\u2019t looking,\u201d said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said George, looking mildly impressed. \u201cWell \u2014 that\u2019d explain it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas Ron saved a goal yet?\u201d asked Hermione, peering over the top of Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms.\n\n\u201cWell, he can do it if he doesn\u2019t think anyone\u2019s watching him,\u201d said Fred, rolling his eyes. \u201cSo all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday.\u201d\n\nHe got up again and moved restlessly to the window, staring out across the dark grounds.\n\n\u201cYou know, Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for.\u201d\n\nHermione cast him a stern look.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got exams coming!\u201d\n\n\u201cTold you already, we\u2019re not fussed about N.E.W.T.s,\u201d said Fred. \u201cThe Snackboxes are ready to roll, we found out how to get rid of those boils, just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them, Lee put us onto it . . .\u201d\n\nGeorge yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky.\n\n\u201cI dunno if I even want to watch this match. If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cKill him, more like,\u201d said Fred firmly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with Quidditch,\u201d said Hermione absentmindedly, once again bent over her Rune translation, \u201cit creates all this bad feeling and tension between the Houses.\u201d\n\nShe looked up to find her copy of Spellman\u2019s Syllabary and caught Fred, George, and Harry looking at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces.\n\n\u201cWell, it does!\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s only a game, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d said Harry, shaking his head, \u201cyou\u2019re good on feelings and stuff, but you just don\u2019t understand about Quidditch.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d she said darkly, returning to her translation again, \u201cbut at least my happiness doesn\u2019t depend on Ron\u2019s goalkeeping ability.\u201d\n\nAnd though Harry would rather have jumped off the Astronomy Tower than admit it to her, by the time he had watched the game the following Saturday he would have given any number of Galleons not to care about Quidditch either.\n\nThe very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short; the Gryffindor spectators had to endure only twenty-two minutes of agony. It was hard to say what the worst thing was: Harry thought it was a close-run contest between Ron\u2019s fourteenth failed save, Sloper missing the Bludger but hitting Angelina in the mouth with his bat, and Kirke shrieking and falling backward off his broom as Zacharias Smith zoomed at him carrying the Quaffle. The miracle was that Gryffindor only lost by ten points: Ginny managed to snatch the Snitch from right under Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby\u2019s nose, so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty.\n\n\u201cGood catch,\u201d Harry told Ginny back in the common room, where the atmosphere closely resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral.\n\n\u201cI was lucky,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very fast Snitch and Summerby\u2019s got a cold, he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment. Anyway, once you\u2019re back on the team \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGinny, I\u2019ve got a lifelong ban.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school,\u201d Ginny corrected him. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference. Anyway, once you\u2019re back, I think I\u2019ll try out for Chaser. Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal-scoring to Seeking anyway.\u201d\n\nHarry looked over at Ron, who was hunched in a corner, staring at his knees, a bottle of butterbeer clutched in his hand.\n\n\u201cAngelina still won\u2019t let him resign,\u201d Ginny said, as though reading Harry\u2019s mind. \u201cShe says she knows he\u2019s got it in him.\u201d\n\nHarry liked Angelina for the faith she was showing in Ron, but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team. Ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of \u201cWeasley Is Our King\u201d sung with great gusto by the Slytherins, who were now favorites to win the Quidditch Cup.\n\nFred and George wandered over.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got the heart to take the mickey out of him, even,\u201d said Fred, looking over at Ron\u2019s crumpled figure. \u201cMind you . . . when he missed the fourteenth . . .\u201d\n\nHe made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright doggy-paddle.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll save it for parties, eh?\u201d\n\nRon dragged himself up to bed shortly after this. Out of respect for his feelings, Harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself, so that Ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to. Sure enough, when Harry finally entered the room Ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible.\n\nHarry got into bed, thinking about the match. It had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines. He was quite impressed by Ginny\u2019s performance but he felt that if he had been playing he could have caught the Snitch sooner. . . . There had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke\u2019s ankle; if she hadn\u2019t hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor. . . .\n\nUmbridge had been sitting a few rows below Harry and Hermione. Once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him, her wide toad\u2019s mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile. The memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark. After a few minutes, however, he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept, as Snape kept instructing him at the end of every Occlumency lesson.\n\nHe tried for a moment or two, but the thought of Snape on top of memories of Umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment, and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them. Slowly, Ron\u2019s snores died away, replaced by the sound of deep, slow breathing. It took Harry much longer to get to sleep; his body was tired, but it took his brain a long time to close down.\n\nHe dreamed that Neville and Professor Sprout were waltzing around the Room of Requirement while Professor McGonagall played the bagpipes. He watched them happily for a while, then decided to go and find the other members of the D.A . . .\n\nBut when he left the room he found himself facing, not the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall. He turned his head slowly to the left. There, at the far end of the windowless passage, was a plain, black door.\n\nHe walked toward it with a sense of mounting excitement. He had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last, and find the way to open it. . . . He was feet from it and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the right-hand side. . . . The door was ajar. . . . He stretched out his hand to push it wide and \u2014\n\nRon gave a loud, rasping, genuine snore, and Harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness, to open a door that was hundreds of miles away. He let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt. He knew he should not have seen the door, but at the same time, felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with Ron. . . . If he could have saved his snore for just another minute . . .\n\n\nThey entered the Great Hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on Monday morning. Hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her Daily Prophet: Nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped Death Eaters, who, despite many reported sightings, had still not been caught. She gave the delivery owl a Knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while Harry helped himself to orange juice; as he had only received one note during the entire year he was sure, when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him, that it had made a mistake.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019re you after?\u201d he asked it, languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forward to see the recipient\u2019s name and address:\n\n\n\nHarry Potter\n\nGreat Hall\n\nHogwarts School\n\n\n\n\n\nFrowning, he made to take the letter from the owl, but before he could do so, three, four, five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position, treading in the butter, knocking over the salt, and each attempting to give him their letters first.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ron asked in amazement, as the whole of Gryffindor table leaned forward to watch as another seven owls landed amongst the first ones, screeching, hooting, and flapping their wings.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d said Hermione breathlessly, plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long, cylindrical package. \u201cI think I know what this means \u2014 open this one first!\u201d\n\nHarry ripped off the brown packaging. Out rolled a tightly furled copy of March\u2019s edition of The Quibbler. He unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover. In large red letters across his picture were the words:\n\n\n\nHARRY POTTER SPEAKS OUT AT LAST: THE TRUTH ABOUT HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED AND THE NIGHT I SAW HIM RETURN\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Luna, who had drifted over to the Gryffindor table and now squeezed herself onto the bench between Fred and Ron. \u201cIt came out yesterday, I asked Dad to send you a free copy. I expect all these,\u201d she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of Harry, \u201care letters from readers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d said Hermione eagerly, \u201cHarry, d\u2019you mind if we \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d said Harry, feeling slightly bemused.\n\nRon and Hermione both started ripping open envelopes.\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s from a bloke who thinks you\u2019re off your rocker,\u201d said Ron, glancing down his letter. \u201cAh well . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThis woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St. Mungo\u2019s,\u201d said Hermione, looking disappointed and crumpling up a second.\n\n\u201cThis one looks okay, though,\u201d said Harry slowly, scanning a long letter from a witch in Paisley. \u201cHey, she says she believes me!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s in two minds,\u201d said Fred, who had joined in the letter-opening with enthusiasm. \u201cSays you don\u2019t come across as a mad person, but he really doesn\u2019t want to believe You-Know-Who\u2019s back so he doesn\u2019t know what to think now. . . . Blimey, what a waste of parchment . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s another one you\u2019ve convinced, Harry!\u201d said Hermione excitedly. \u201c\u2018Having read your side of the story I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly. . . . Little though I want to think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth . . .\u2019 Oh this is wonderful!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother one who thinks you\u2019re barking,\u201d said Ron, throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder, \u201cbut this one says you\u2019ve got her converted, and she now thinks you\u2019re a real hero \u2014 she\u2019s put in a photograph too \u2014 wow \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d said a falsely sweet, girlish voice.\n\nHarry looked up with his hands full of envelopes. Professor Umbridge was standing behind Fred and Luna, her bulging toad\u2019s eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of Harry. Behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly.\n\n\u201cWhy have you got all these letters, Mr. Potter?\u201d she asked slowly.\n\n\u201cIs that a crime now?\u201d said Fred loudly. \u201cGetting mail?\u201d\n\n\u201cBe careful, Mr. Weasley, or I shall have to put you in detention,\u201d said Umbridge. \u201cWell, Mr. Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry hesitated, but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet; it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of The Quibbler came to Umbridge\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cPeople have written to me because I gave an interview,\u201d said Harry. \u201cAbout what happened to me last June.\u201d\n\nFor some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this. He had the strangest feeling that Dumbledore had been watching him a second before, but when he looked, Dumbledore seemed to be absorbed in conversation with Professor Flitwick.\n\n\u201cAn interview?\u201d repeated Umbridge, her voice thinner and higher than ever. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHere \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd he threw the copy of The Quibbler at her. She caught it and stared down at the cover. Her pale, doughy face turned an ugly, patchy violet.\n\n\u201cWhen did you do this?\u201d she asked, her voice trembling slightly.\n\n\u201cLast Hogsmeade weekend,\u201d said Harry.\n\nShe looked up at him, incandescent with rage, the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers.\n\n\u201cThere will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you, Mr. Potter,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow you dare . . . how you could . . .\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies. The message, apparently, has still not sunk in. Fifty points from Gryffindor and another week\u2019s worth of detentions.\u201d\n\nShe stalked away, clutching The Quibbler to her chest, the eyes of many students following her.\n\nBy mid-morning enormous signs had been put up all over the school, not just on House notice boards, but in the corridors and classrooms too.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 BY ORDER OF \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe High Inquisitor of Hogwarts\n\n\n\n\nAny student found in possession of the magazine The Quibbler will be expelled.\n\n\n\nThe above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-seven.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some reason, every time Hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure.\n\n\u201cWhat exactly are you so happy about?\u201d Harry asked her.\n\n\u201cOh Harry, don\u2019t you see?\u201d Hermione breathed. \u201cIf she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview, it was banning it!\u201d\n\nAnd it seemed that Hermione was quite right. By the end of that day, though Harry had not seen so much as a corner of The Quibbler anywhere in the school, the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview at each other; Harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes, discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons, while Hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls\u2019 toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before Ancient Runes.\n\n\u201cAnd then they spotted me, and obviously they know I know you, so they were bombarding me with questions,\u201d Hermione told Harry, her eyes shining, \u201cand Harry, I think they believe you, I really do, I think you\u2019ve finally got them convinced!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Professor Umbridge was stalking the school, stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets. Harry knew she was looking for copies of The Quibbler, but the students were several steps ahead of her. The pages carrying Harry\u2019s interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read it, or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again. Soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it.\n\nThe teachers were, of course, forbidden from mentioning the interview by Educational Decree Number Twenty-six, but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same. Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering can; a beaming Professor Flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the end of Charms, said \u201cShh!\u201d and hurried away; and Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during Divination and announced to the startled class, and a very disapproving Umbridge, that Harry was not going to suffer an early death after all, but would live to a ripe old age, become Minister of Magic, and have twelve children.\n\nBut what made Harry happiest was Cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to Transfiguration the next day. Before he knew what had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear, \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry. That interview was so brave . . . it made me cry.\u201d\n\nHe was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it, but very glad they were on speaking terms again, and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again. And unbelievably, no sooner had he arrived outside Transfiguration than something just as good happened: Seamus stepped out of the queue to face him.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to say,\u201d he mumbled, squinting at Harry\u2019s left knee, \u201cI believe you. And I\u2019ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam.\u201d\n\nIf anything more was needed to complete Harry\u2019s happiness, it was Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\u2019s reactions. He saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library, together with a weedy-looking boy Hermione whispered was called Theodore Nott. They looked around at Harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on Partial Vanishment, and Goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and Malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe. Harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this: He had named all of their fathers as Death Eaters.\n\n\u201cAnd the best bit is,\u201d whispered Hermione gleefully as they left the library, \u201cthey can\u2019t contradict you, because they can\u2019t admit they\u2019ve read the article!\u201d\n\nTo cap it all, Luna told him over dinner that no copy of The Quibbler had ever sold out faster.\n\n\u201cDad\u2019s reprinting!\u201d she told Harry, her eyes popping excitedly. \u201cHe can\u2019t believe it, he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks!\u201d\n\nHarry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that night; daringly, Fred and George had put an Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry\u2019s giant head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally saying things like \u201cThe Ministry are morons\u201d and \u201cEat dung, Umbridge\u201d in a booming voice. Hermione did not find this very amusing; she said it interfered with her concentration, and ended up going to bed early out of irritation. Harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two, especially when the talking spell had started to wear off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like \u201cDung\u201d and \u201cUmbridge\u201d at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice. In fact it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again. To disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him, asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time, he announced that he too needed an early night.\n\nThe dormitory was empty when he reached it. He rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed; it felt soothing against his scar. Then he undressed and got into bed, wishing his headache would go away. He also felt slightly sick. He rolled over onto his side, closed his eyes, and fell asleep almost at once. . . .\n\nHe was standing in a dark, curtained room lit by a single branch of candles. His hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him. They were long-fingered and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large, pale spiders against the dark velvet of the chair.\n\nBeyond the chair, in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles, knelt a man in black robes.\n\n\u201cI have been badly advised, it seems,\u201d said Harry, in a high, cold voice that pulsed with anger.\n\n\u201cMaster, I crave your pardon . . .\u201d croaked the man kneeling on the floor. The back of his head glimmered in the candlelight. He seemed to be trembling.\n\n\u201cI do not blame you, Rookwood,\u201d said Harry in that cold, cruel voice.\n\nHe relinquished his grip upon the chair and walked around it, closer to the man cowering upon the floor, until he stood directly over him in the darkness, looking down from a far greater height than usual.\n\n\u201cYou are sure of your facts, Rookwood?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, my Lord, yes . . . I used to work in the department after \u2014 after all . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAvery told me Bode would be able to remove it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBode could never have taken it, Master. . . . Bode would have known he could not. . . . Undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy\u2019s Imperius Curse . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cStand up, Rookwood,\u201d whispered Harry.\n\nThe kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey. His face was pockmarked; the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight. He remained a little stooped when standing, as though halfway through a bow, and he darted terrified looks up at Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cYou have done well to tell me this,\u201d said Harry. \u201cVery well . . . I have wasted months on fruitless schemes, it seems. . . . But no matter . . . We begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort\u2019s gratitude, Rookwood . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lord . . . yes, my Lord,\u201d gasped Rookwood, his voice hoarse with relief.\n\n\u201cI shall need your help. I shall need all the information you can give me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, my Lord, of course . . . anything . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well . . . you may go. Send Avery to me.\u201d\n\nRookwood scurried backward, bowing, and disappeared through a door.\n\nLeft alone in the dark room, Harry turned toward the wall. A cracked, age-spotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadows. Harry moved toward it. His reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness. . . . A face whiter than a skull . . . red eyes with slits for pupils . . .\n\n\u201cNOOOOOOOOO!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d yelled a voice nearby.\n\nHarry flailed around madly, became entangled in the hangings, and fell out of his bed. For a few seconds he did not know where he was; he was convinced that he was about to see the white, skull-like face looming at him out of the dark again, then Ron\u2019s voice spoke very near to him.\n\n\u201cWill you stop acting like a maniac, and I can get you out of here!\u201d\n\nRon wrenched the hangings apart, and Harry stared up at him in the moonlight, as he lay flat on his back, his scar searing with pain. Ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed; one arm was out of his robes.\n\n\u201cHas someone been attacked again?\u201d asked Ron, pulling Harry roughly to his feet. \u201cIs it Dad? Is it that snake?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 everyone\u2019s fine \u2014\u201d gasped Harry, whose forehead felt as though it was on fire again. \u201cWell . . . Avery isn\u2019t. . . . He\u2019s in trouble. . . . He gave him the wrong information. . . . He\u2019s really angry . . .\u201d\n\nHarry groaned and sank, shaking, onto his bed, rubbing his scar.\n\n\u201cBut Rookwood\u2019s going to help him now. . . . He\u2019s on the right track again . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Ron, sounding scared. \u201cD\u2019you mean . . . did you just see You-Know-Who?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was You-Know-Who,\u201d said Harry, and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face to check that they were no longer deathly white and long-fingered. \u201cHe was with Rookwood, he\u2019s one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban, remember? Rookwood\u2019s just told him Bode couldn\u2019t have done it . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDone what?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemove something. . . . He said Bode would have known he couldn\u2019t have done it. . . . Bode was under the Imperius Curse. . . . I think he said Malfoy\u2019s dad put it on him . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBode was bewitched to remove something?\u201d Ron said. \u201cBut \u2014 Harry, that\u2019s got to be \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe weapon,\u201d Harry finished the sentence for him. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nThe dormitory door opened; Dean and Seamus came in. Harry swung his legs back into bed. He did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened, seeing as Seamus had only just stopped thinking Harry was a nutter.\n\n\u201cDid you say,\u201d murmured Ron, putting his head close to Harry\u2019s on the pretense of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table, \u201cthat you were You-Know-Who?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\nRon took an unnecessarily large gulp of water. Harry saw it spill over his chin onto his chest.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he said, as Dean and Seamus clattered around noisily, pulling off their robes, and talking, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to tell \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got to tell anyone,\u201d said Harry shortly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency. I\u2019m supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out. That\u2019s what they want.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cthey\u201d he meant Dumbledore. He got back into bed and rolled over onto his side with his back to Ron and after a while he heard Ron\u2019s mattress creak as he lay back down too. His scar began to burn; he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise. Somewhere, he knew, Avery was being punished. . . .\n\n\nHarry and Ron waited until break next morning to tell Hermione exactly what had happened. They wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard. Standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard, Harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember. When he had finished, she said nothing at all for a few moments, but stared with a kind of painful intensity at Fred and George, who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why they killed him,\u201d she said quietly, withdrawing her gaze from Fred and George at last. \u201cWhen Bode tried to steal this weapon, something funny happened to him. I think there must be defensive spells on it, or around it, to stop people from touching it. That\u2019s why he was in St. Mungo\u2019s, his brain had gone all funny and he couldn\u2019t talk. But remember what the Healer told us? He was recovering. And they couldn\u2019t risk him getting better, could they? I mean, the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift. Once he\u2019d got his voice back, he\u2019d explain what he\u2019d been doing, wouldn\u2019t he? They would have known he\u2019d been sent to steal the weapon. Of course, it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him. Never out of the Ministry, is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was even hanging around that day I had my hearing,\u201d said Harry. \u201cIn the \u2014 hang on . . .\u201d he said slowly. \u201cHe was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing, but what if \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSturgis,\u201d gasped Hermione, looking thunderstruck.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d said Ron, looking bewildered.\n\n\u201cSturgis Podmore,\u201d said Hermione, breathlessly. \u201cArrested for trying to get through a door. Lucius Malfoy got him too. I bet he did it the day you saw him there, Harry. Sturgis had Moody\u2019s Invisibility Cloak, right? So what if he was standing guard by the door, invisible, and Malfoy heard him move, or guessed he was there, or just did the Imperius Curse on the off chance that a guard was there? So when Sturgis next had an opportunity \u2014 probably when it was his turn on guard duty again \u2014 he tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for Voldemort \u2014 Ron, be quiet \u2014 but he got caught and sent to Azkaban . . .\u201d\n\nShe gazed at Harry.\n\n\u201cAnd now Rookwood\u2019s told Voldemort how to get the weapon?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear all the conversation, but that\u2019s what it sounded like,\u201d said Harry. \u201cRookwood used to work there. . . . Maybe Voldemort\u2019ll send Rookwood to do it?\u201d\n\nHermione nodded, apparently still lost in thought. Then, quite abruptly, she said, \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have seen this at all, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, taken aback.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing,\u201d said Hermione, suddenly stern.\n\n\u201cI know I am,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think we should just try and forget what you saw,\u201d said Hermione firmly. \u201cAnd you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on.\u201d\n\nThe week did not improve as it progressed: Harry received two more D\u2019s in Potions, was still on tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack, and could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in which he had seen Voldemort, though he did not bring it up with Ron and Hermione again because he did not want another telling-off from Hermione. He wished very much that he could have talked to Sirius about it, but that was out of the question, so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind.\n\nUnfortunately, the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been.\n\n\u201cGet up, Potter.\u201d\n\nA couple of weeks after his dream of Rookwood, Harry was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of Snape\u2019s office, trying to clear his head. He had just been forced, yet again, to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realized he still had, most of them concerning humiliations Dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school.\n\n\u201cThat last memory,\u201d said Snape. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry, getting wearily to his feet. He was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that Snape kept calling forth. \u201cYou mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Snape softly. \u201cI mean the one concerning a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . nothing,\u201d said Harry.\n\nSnape\u2019s dark eyes bored into Harry\u2019s. Remembering what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial to Legilimency, Harry blinked and looked away.\n\n\u201cHow do that man and that room come to be inside your head, Potter?\u201d said Snape.\n\n\u201cIt \u2014\u201d said Harry, looking everywhere but at Snape, \u201cit was \u2014 just a dream I had.\u201d\n\n\u201cA dream,\u201d repeated Snape.\n\nThere was a pause during which Harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a purple liquid in its jar.\n\n\u201cYou do know why we are here, don\u2019t you, Potter?\u201d said Snape in a low, dangerous voice. \u201cYou do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry stiffly.\n\n\u201cRemind me why we are here, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I can learn Occlumency,\u201d said Harry, now glaring at a dead eel.\n\n\u201cCorrect, Potter. And dim though you may be\u201d \u2014 Harry looked back at Snape, hating him \u2014 \u201cI would have thought that after two months\u2019 worth of lessons you might have made some progress. How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust that one,\u201d lied Harry.\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Snape, his dark, cold eyes narrowing slightly, \u201cperhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams, Potter. Maybe they make you feel special \u2014 important?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry, his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand.\n\n\u201cThat is just as well, Potter,\u201d said Snape coldly, \u201cbecause you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 that\u2019s your job, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry shot at him.\n\nHe had not meant to say it; it had burst out of him in temper. For a long moment they stared at each other, Harry convinced he had gone too far. But there was a curious, almost satisfied expression on Snape\u2019s face when he answered.\n\n\u201cYes, Potter,\u201d he said, his eyes glinting. \u201cThat is my job. Now, if you are ready, we will start again . . .\u201d\n\nHe raised his wand. \u201cOne \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014 Legilimens!\u201d\n\nA hundred dementors were swooping toward Harry across the lake in the grounds. . . . He screwed up his face in concentration. . . . They were coming closer. . . . He could see the dark holes beneath their hoods . . . yet he could also see Snape standing in front of him, his eyes fixed upon Harry\u2019s face, muttering under his breath. . . . And somehow, Snape was growing clearer, and the dementors were growing fainter . . .\n\nHarry raised his own wand.\n\n\u201cProtego!\u201d\n\nSnape staggered; his wand flew upward, away from Harry \u2014 and suddenly Harry\u2019s mind was teeming with memories that were not his \u2014 a hook-nosed man was shouting at a cowering woman, while a small dark-haired boy cried in a corner. . . . A greasy-haired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom, pointing his wand at the ceiling, shooting down flies. . . . A girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick \u2014\n\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest; he took several staggering steps backward, hit some of the shelves covering Snape\u2019s walls and heard something crack. Snape was shaking slightly, very white in the face.\n\nThe back of Harry\u2019s robes were damp. One of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it; the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion.\n\n\u201cReparo!\u201d hissed Snape, and the jar sealed itself once more. \u201cWell, Potter . . . that was certainly an improvement . . .\u201d Panting slightly, Snape straightened the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though checking that they were still there. \u201cI don\u2019t remember telling you to use a Shield Charm . . . but there is no doubt that it was effective . . .\u201d\n\nHarry did not speak; he felt that to say anything might be dangerous. He was sure he had just broken into Snape\u2019s memories, that he had just seen scenes from Snape\u2019s childhood, and it was unnerving to think that the crying little boy who had watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes. . . .\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try again, shall we?\u201d said Snape.\n\nHarry felt a thrill of dread: He was about to pay for what had just happened, he was sure of it. They moved back into position with the desk between them, Harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time. . . .\n\n\u201cOn the count of three, then,\u201d said Snape, raising his wand once more. \u201cOne \u2014 two \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind, for Snape had already cried \u201cLegilimens!\u201d\n\nHe was hurtling along the corridor toward the Department of Mysteries, past the blank stone walls, past the torches \u2014 the plain black door was growing ever larger; he was moving so fast he was going to collide with it, he was feet from it and he could see that chink of faint blue light again \u2014\n\nThe door had flown open! He was through it at last, inside a black-walled, black-floored circular room lit with blue-flamed candles, and there were more doors all around him \u2014 he needed to go on \u2014 but which door ought he to take \u2014 ?\n\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\n\nHarry opened his eyes. He was flat on his back again with no memory of having gotten there; he was also panting as though he really had run the length of the Department of Mysteries corridor, really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room. . . .\n\n\u201cExplain yourself!\u201d said Snape, who was standing over him, looking furious.\n\n\u201cI . . . dunno what happened,\u201d said Harry truthfully, standing up. There was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before. I mean, I told you, I\u2019ve dreamed about the door . . . but it\u2019s never opened before . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not working hard enough!\u201d\n\nFor some reason, Snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before, when Harry had seen into his own memories.\n\n\u201cYou are lazy and sloppy, Potter, it is small wonder that the Dark Lord \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you tell me something, sir?\u201d said Harry, firing up again. \u201cWhy do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I\u2019ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape opened his mouth in a snarl \u2014 and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room.\n\nSnape\u2019s head jerked upward; he was gazing at the ceiling.\n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d he muttered.\n\nHarry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the entrance hall. Snape looked around at him, frowning.\n\n\u201cDid you see anything unusual on your way down here, Potter?\u201d\n\nHarry shook his head. Somewhere above them, the woman screamed again. Snape strode to his office door, his wand still held at the ready, and swept out of sight. Harry hesitated for a moment, then followed.\n\nThe screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall; they grew louder as Harry ran toward the stone steps leading up from the dungeons. When he reached the top he found the entrance hall packed. Students had come flooding out of the Great Hall, where dinner was still in progress, to see what was going on. Others had crammed themselves onto the marble staircase. Harry pushed forward through a knot of tall Slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring, some of them looking shocked, others even frightened. Professor McGonagall was directly opposite Harry on the other side of the hall; she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick.\n\nProfessor Trelawney was standing in the middle of the entrance hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other, looking utterly mad. Her hair was sticking up on end, her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other; her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders, giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams. Two large trunks lay on the floor beside her, one of them upside down; it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her. Professor Trelawney was staring, apparently terrified, at something Harry could not see but that seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cNO! This cannot be happening. . . . It cannot . . . I refuse to accept it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t realize this was coming?\u201d said a high girlish voice, sounding callously amused, and Harry, moving slightly to his right, saw that Trelawney\u2019s terrifying vision was nothing other than Professor Umbridge. \u201cIncapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow\u2019s weather, you must surely have realized that your pitiful performance during my inspections, and lack of any improvement, would make it inevitable you would be sacked?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou c-can\u2019t!\u201d howled Professor Trelawney, tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses, \u201cyou c-can\u2019t sack me! I\u2019ve b-been here sixteen years! H-Hogwarts is m-my h-home!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was your home,\u201d said Professor Umbridge, and Harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched Professor Trelawney sink, sobbing uncontrollably, onto one of her trunks, \u201cuntil an hour ago, when the Minister of Magic countersigned the order for your dismissal. Now kindly remove yourself from this hall. You are embarrassing us.\u201d\n\nBut she stood and watched, with an expression of gloating enjoyment, as Professor Trelawney shuddered and moaned, rocking backward and forward on her trunk in paroxysms of grief. Harry heard a sob to his left and looked around. Lavender and Parvati were both crying silently, their arms around each other. Then he heard footsteps. Professor McGonagall had broken away from the spectators, marched straight up to Professor Trelawney and was patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes.\n\n\u201cThere, there, Sybill . . . Calm down. . . . Blow your nose on this. . . . It\u2019s not as bad as you think, now. . . . You are not going to have to leave Hogwarts . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh really, Professor McGonagall?\u201d said Umbridge in a deadly voice, taking a few steps forward. \u201cAnd your authority for that statement is . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be mine,\u201d said a deep voice.\n\nThe oak front doors had swung open. Students beside them scuttled out of the way as Dumbledore appeared in the entrance. What he had been doing out in the grounds Harry could not imagine, but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night. Leaving the doors wide behind him, he strode forward through the circle of onlookers toward the place where Professor Trelawney sat, tearstained and trembling, upon her trunk, Professor McGonagall alongside her.\n\n\u201cYours, Professor Dumbledore?\u201d said Umbridge with a singularly unpleasant little laugh. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you do not understand the position. I have here\u201d \u2014 she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes \u2014 \u201can Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister of Magic. Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect, place upon probation, and sack any teacher she \u2014 that is to say, I \u2014 feel is not performing up to the standard required by the Ministry of Magic. I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch. I have dismissed her.\u201d\n\nTo Harry\u2019s very great surprise, Dumbledore continued to smile. He looked down at Professor Trelawney, who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk, and said, \u201cYou are quite right, of course, Professor Umbridge. As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to send them away from the castle. I am afraid,\u201d he went on, with a courteous little bow, \u201cthat the power to do that still resides with the headmaster, and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts.\u201d\n\nAt this, Professor Trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccup was barely hidden.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 no, I\u2019ll g-go, Dumbledore! I sh-shall l-leave Hogwarts and s-seek my fortune elsewhere \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dumbledore sharply. \u201cIt is my wish that you remain, Sybill.\u201d\n\nHe turned to Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cMight I ask you to escort Sybill back upstairs, Professor McGonagall?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said McGonagall. \u201cUp you get, Sybill . . .\u201d\n\nProfessor Sprout came hurrying forward out of the crowd and grabbed Professor Trelawney\u2019s other arm. Together they guided her past Umbridge and up the marble stairs. Professor Flitwick went scurrying after them, his wand held out before him; he squeaked, \u201cLocomotor trunks!\u201d and Professor Trelawney\u2019s luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her, Professor Flitwick bringing up the rear.\n\nProfessor Umbridge was standing stock-still, staring at Dumbledore, who continued to smile benignly.\n\n\u201cAnd what,\u201d she said in a whisper that nevertheless carried all around the entrance hall, \u201care you going to do with her once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d said Dumbledore pleasantly. \u201cYou see, I have already found us a new Divination teacher, and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve found \u2014 ?\u201d said Umbridge shrilly. \u201cYou\u2019ve found? Might I remind you, Dumbledore, that under Educational Decree Twenty-two \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 the Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if \u2014 and only if \u2014 the headmaster is unable to find one,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded. May I introduce you?\u201d\n\nHe turned to face the open front doors, through which night mist was now drifting. Harry heard hooves. There was a shocked murmur around the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even farther backward, some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer.\n\nThrough the mist came a face Harry had seen once before on a dark, dangerous night in the Forbidden Forest: white-blond hair and astonishingly blue eyes, the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse.\n\n\u201cThis is Firenze,\u201d said Dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck Umbridge. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find him suitable.\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter27": "THE CENTAUR AND THE SNEAK\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll bet you wish you hadn\u2019t given up Divination now, don\u2019t you, Hermione?\u201d asked Parvati, smirking.\n\nIt was breakfast time a few days after the sacking of Professor Trelawney, and Parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon. They were to have their first lesson with Firenze that morning.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Hermione indifferently, who was reading the Daily Prophet. \u201cI\u2019ve never really liked horses.\u201d\n\nShe turned a page of the newspaper, scanning its columns.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a horse, he\u2019s a centaur!\u201d said Lavender, sounding shocked.\n\n\u201cA gorgeous centaur . . .\u201d sighed Parvati.\n\n\u201cEither way, he\u2019s still got four legs,\u201d said Hermione coolly. \u201cAnyway, I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are!\u201d Lavender assured her. \u201cWe went up to her office to see her, we took her some daffodils \u2014 not the honking ones that Sprout\u2019s got, nice ones . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is she?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cNot very good, poor thing,\u201d said Lavender sympathetically. \u201cShe was crying and saying she\u2019d rather leave the castle forever than stay here if Umbridge is still here, and I don\u2019t blame her. Umbridge was horrible to her, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible,\u201d said Hermione darkly.\n\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d said Ron, who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon. \u201cShe can\u2019t get any worse than she\u2019s been already.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mark my words, she\u2019s going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her,\u201d said Hermione, closing the newspaper. \u201cEspecially another part-human. You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze . . .\u201d\n\nAfter breakfast Hermione departed for her Arithmancy class and Harry and Ron followed Parvati and Lavender into the entrance hall, heading for Divination.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t we going up to North Tower?\u201d asked Ron, looking puzzled, as Parvati bypassed the marble staircase.\n\nParvati looked scornfully over her shoulder at him.\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you expect Firenze to climb that ladder? We\u2019re in classroom eleven now, it was on the notice board yesterday.\u201d\n\nClassroom eleven was situated in the ground-floor corridor leading off the entrance hall on the opposite side to the Great Hall. Harry knew it to be one of those classrooms that were never used regularly, and that it therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom. When he entered it right behind Ron, and found himself right in the middle of a forest clearing, he was therefore momentarily stunned.\n\n\u201cWhat the \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nThe classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled, green light. The students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders, arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests, looking rather nervous. In the middle of the room, where there were no trees, stood Firenze.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d he said, holding out a hand when Harry entered.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 hi,\u201d said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile. \u201cEr \u2014 good to see you . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d said the centaur, inclining his white-blond head. \u201cIt was foretold that we would meet again.\u201d\n\nHarry noticed that there was the shadow of a hoof-shaped bruise on Firenze\u2019s chest. As he turned to join the rest of the class upon the floor, he saw that they were all looking at him with awe, apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with Firenze, whom they seemed to find intimidating.\n\nWhen the door was closed and the last student had sat down upon a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket, Firenze gestured around the room.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us,\u201d said Firenze, when everyone had settled down, \u201cin imitation of my natural habitat. I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden Forest, which was \u2014 until Monday \u2014 my home . . . but this is not possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease \u2014 er \u2014 sir \u2014\u201d said Parvati breathlessly, raising her hand, \u201cwhy not? We\u2019ve been in there with Hagrid, we\u2019re not frightened!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a question of your bravery,\u201d said Firenze, \u201cbut of my position. I can no longer return to the forest. My herd has banished me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHerd?\u201d said Lavender in a confused voice, and Harry knew she was thinking of cows. \u201cWhat \u2014 oh!\u201d Comprehension dawned on her face. \u201cThere are more of you?\u201d she said, stunned.\n\n\u201cDid Hagrid breed you, like the thestrals?\u201d asked Dean eagerly.\n\nFirenze turned his head very slowly to face Dean, who seemed to realize at once that he had said something very offensive.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2014 I meant \u2014 sorry,\u201d he finished in a hushed voice.\n\n\u201cCentaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans,\u201d said Firenze quietly. There was a pause, then Parvati raised her hand again.\n\n\u201cPlease, sir . . . why have the other centaurs banished you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore,\u201d said Firenze. \u201cThey see this as a betrayal of our kind.\u201d\n\nHarry remembered how, nearly four years ago, the centaur Bane had shouted at Firenze for allowing Harry to ride to safety upon his back, calling him a \u201ccommon mule.\u201d He wondered whether it had been Bane who had kicked Firenze in the chest.\n\n\u201cLet us begin,\u201d said Firenze. He swished his long palomino tail, raised his hand toward the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it slowly, and as he did so, the light in the room dimmed, so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight, and stars emerged upon the ceiling. There were oohs and gasps, and Ron said audibly, \u201cBlimey!\u201d\n\n\u201cLie back upon the floor,\u201d said Firenze in his calm voice, \u201cand observe the heavens. Here is written, for those who can see, the fortune of our races.\u201d\n\nHarry stretched out on his back and gazed upward at the ceiling. A twinkling red star winked at him from overhead.\n\n\u201cI know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy,\u201d said Firenze\u2019s calm voice, \u201cand that you have mapped the stars\u2019 progress through the heavens. Centaurs have unraveled the mysteries of these movements over centuries. Our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Trelawney did Astrology with us!\u201d said Parvati excitedly, raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay on her back. \u201cMars causes accidents and burns and things like that, and when it makes an angle to Saturn, like now\u201d \u2014 she drew a right angle in the air above her \u2014 \u201cthat means that people need to be extra careful when handling hot things \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d said Firenze calmly, \u201cis human nonsense.\u201d\n\nParvati\u2019s hand fell limply to her side.\n\n\u201cTrivial hurts, tiny human accidents,\u201d said Firenze, as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor. \u201cThese are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe, and are unaffected by planetary movements.\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Trelawney \u2014\u201d began Parvati, in a hurt and indignant voice.\n\n\u201c\u2014 is a human,\u201d said Firenze simply. \u201cAnd is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind.\u201d\n\nHarry turned his head very slightly to look at Parvati. She looked very offended, as did several of the people surrounding her.\n\n\u201cSybill Trelawney may have Seen, I do not know,\u201d continued Firenze, and Harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them, \u201cbut she wastes her time, in the main, on the self-flattering nonsense humans call fortune-telling. I, however, am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs, which is impersonal and impartial. We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there. It may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing.\u201d\n\nFirenze pointed to the red star directly above Harry.\n\n\u201cIn the past decade, the indications have been that Wizard-kind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars. Mars, bringer of battle, shines brightly above us, suggesting that the fight must break out again soon. How soon, centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves, by the observation of fume and flame . . .\u201d\n\nIt was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended. They did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes, but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described, telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this, that it took centaurs years and years to become competent, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things anyway, because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly. He was nothing like any human teacher Harry had ever had. His priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing, not even centaurs\u2019 knowledge, was foolproof.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not very definite on anything, is he?\u201d said Ron in a low voice, as they put out their mallowsweet fire. \u201cI mean, I could do with a few more details about this war we\u2019re about to have, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped; Harry had completely forgotten that they were still inside the castle, quite convinced that he was really in the forest. The class filed out, looking slightly perplexed; Harry and Ron were on the point of following them when Firenze called, \u201cHarry Potter, a word, please.\u201d\n\nHarry turned. The centaur advanced a little toward him. Ron hesitated.\n\n\u201cYou may stay,\u201d Firenze told him. \u201cBut close the door, please.\u201d\n\nRon hastened to obey.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, you are a friend of Hagrid\u2019s, are you not?\u201d said the centaur.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThen give him a warning from me. His attempt is not working. He would do better to abandon it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis attempt is not working?\u201d Harry repeated blankly.\n\n\u201cAnd he would do better to abandon it,\u201d said Firenze, nodding. \u201cI would warn Hagrid myself, but I am banished \u2014 it would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now \u2014 Hagrid has troubles enough, without a centaurs\u2019 battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 what\u2019s Hagrid attempting to do?\u201d said Harry nervously.\n\nFirenze looked at Harry impassively.\n\n\u201cHagrid has recently rendered me a great service,\u201d said Firenze, \u201cand he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures. I shall not betray his secret. But he must be brought to his senses. The attempt is not working. Tell him, Harry Potter. Good day to you.\u201d\n\n\nThe happiness Harry had felt in the aftermath of The Quibbler interview had long since evaporated. As a dull March blurred into a squally April, his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and problems again.\n\nUmbridge had continued attending all Care of Magical Creatures lessons, so it had been very difficult to deliver Firenze\u2019s warning to Hagrid. At last Harry had managed it by pretending he had lost his copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and doubling back after class one day. When he passed on Firenze\u2019s message, Hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy, blackened eyes, apparently taken aback. Then he seemed to pull himself together.\n\n\u201cNice bloke, Firenze,\u201d he said gruffly, \u201cbut he don\u2019 know what he\u2019s talkin\u2019 abou\u2019 on this. The attemp\u2019s comin\u2019 on fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid, what\u2019re you up to?\u201d asked Harry seriously. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got to be careful, Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and if you ask me, she\u2019s on a roll. If you\u2019re doing anything you shouldn\u2019t be \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things more importan\u2019 than keepin\u2019 a job,\u201d said Hagrid, though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of knarl droppings crashed to the floor. \u201cDon\u2019 worry abou\u2019 me, Harry, jus\u2019 get along now, there\u2019s a good lad . . .\u201d\n\nHarry had no choice but to leave Hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor, but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle.\n\nMeanwhile, as the teachers and Hermione persisted in reminding them, the O.W.L.s were drawing ever nearer. All the fifth years were suffering from stress to some degree, but Hannah Abbott became the first to receive a Calming Draught from Madam Pomfrey after she burst into tears during Herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now.\n\nIf it had not been for the D.A. lessons, Harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy. He sometimes felt that he was living for the hours he spent in the Room of Requirement, working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time, swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow D.A. members and saw how far they had come. Indeed, Harry sometimes wondered how Umbridge was going to react when all the members of the D.A. received \u201cOutstanding\u201d in their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L.s.\n\nThey had finally started work on Patronuses, which everybody had been very keen to practice, though as Harry kept reminding them, producing a Patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different to producing it when confronted by something like a dementor.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a killjoy,\u201d said Cho brightly, watching her silvery swan-shaped Patronus soar around the Room of Requirement during their last lesson before Easter. \u201cThey\u2019re so pretty!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not supposed to be pretty, they\u2019re supposed to protect you,\u201d said Harry patiently. \u201cWhat we really need is a boggart or something; that\u2019s how I learned, I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a dementor \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that would be really scary!\u201d said Lavender, who was shooting puffs of silver vapor out of the end of her wand. \u201cAnd I still \u2014 can\u2019t \u2014 do it!\u201d she added angrily.\n\nNeville was having trouble too. His face was screwed up in concentration, but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand-tip.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think of something happy,\u201d Harry reminded him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d said Neville miserably, who was trying so hard his round face was actually shining with sweat.\n\n\u201cHarry, I think I\u2019m doing it!\u201d yelled Seamus, who had been brought along to his first ever D.A. meeting by Dean. \u201cLook \u2014 ah \u2014 it\u2019s gone. . . . But it was definitely something hairy, Harry!\u201d\n\nHermione\u2019s Patronus, a shining silver otter, was gamboling around her.\n\n\u201cThey are sort of nice, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she said, looking at it fondly.\n\nThe door of the Room of Requirement opened and then closed again; Harry looked around to see who had entered, but there did not seem to be anybody there. It was a few moments before he realized that the people close to the door had fallen silent. Next thing he knew, something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee. He looked down and saw, to his very great astonishment, Dobby the house-elf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight hats.\n\n\u201cHi, Dobby!\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you \u2014 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\nFor the elf\u2019s eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking. The members of the D.A. closest to Harry had fallen silent now: Everybody in the room was watching Dobby. The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room looking much darker than before.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, sir . . .\u201d squeaked the elf, trembling from head to foot, \u201cHarry Potter, sir . . . Dobby has come to warn you . . . but the house-elves have been warned not to tell . . .\u201d\n\nHe ran headfirst at the wall: Harry, who had some experience of Dobby\u2019s habits of self-punishment, made to seize him, but Dobby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats. Hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened, Dobby?\u201d Harry asked, grabbing the elf\u2019s tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself.\n\n\u201cHarry Potter . . . she . . . she . . .\u201d\n\nDobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist: Harry seized that too.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018she,\u2019 Dobby?\u201d\n\nBut he thought he knew \u2014 surely only one \u201cshe\u201d could induce such fear in Dobby? The elf looked up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly.\n\n\u201cUmbridge?\u201d asked Harry, horrified.\n\nDobby nodded, then tried to bang his head off Harry\u2019s knees; Harry held him at bay.\n\n\u201cWhat about her? Dobby \u2014 she hasn\u2019t found out about this \u2014 about us \u2014 about the D.A.?\u201d\n\nHe read the answer in the elf\u2019s stricken face. His hands held fast by Harry, the elf tried to kick himself and sank to his knees.\n\n\u201cIs she coming?\u201d Harry asked quietly.\n\nDobby let out a howl. \u201cYes, Harry Potter, yes!\u201d\n\nHarry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf.\n\n\u201cWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\u201d Harry bellowed. \u201cRUN!\u201d\n\nThey all pelted toward the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through; Harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories. It was only ten to nine, if they just took refuge in the library or the Owlery, which were both nearer \u2014\n\n\u201cHarry, come on!\u201d shrieked Hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out.\n\nHe scooped up Dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue.\n\n\u201cDobby \u2014 this is an order \u2014 get back down to the kitchen with the other elves, and if she asks you whether you warned me, lie and say no!\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnd I forbid you to hurt yourself!\u201d he added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the door behind him.\n\n\u201cThank you, Harry Potter!\u201d squeaked Dobby, and he streaked off. Harry glanced left and right, the others were all moving so fast that he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished. He started to run right; there was a boys\u2019 bathroom up ahead, he could pretend he\u2019d been in there all the time if he could just reach it \u2014\n\n\u201cAAARGH!\u201d\n\nSomething caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly, skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt. Someone behind him was laughing. He rolled over onto his back and saw Malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase.\n\n\u201cTrip Jinx, Potter!\u201d he said. \u201cHey, Professor \u2014 PROFESSOR! I\u2019ve got one!\u201d\n\nUmbridge came bustling around the far corner, breathless but wearing a delighted smile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d she said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. \u201cExcellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good \u2014 fifty points to Slytherin! I\u2019ll take him from here. . . . Stand up, Potter!\u201d\n\nHarry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them. He had never seen Umbridge looking so happy. She seized his arm in a vicelike grip and turned, beaming broadly, to Malfoy. \u201cYou hop along and see if you can round up anymore of them, Draco,\u201d she said. \u201cTell the others to look in the library \u2014 anybody out of breath \u2014 check the bathrooms, Miss Parkinson can do the girls\u2019 ones \u2014 off you go \u2014 and you,\u201d she added in her softest, most dangerous voice, as Malfoy walked away. \u201cYou can come with me to the headmaster\u2019s office, Potter.\u201d\n\nThey were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. Harry wondered how many of the others had been caught. He thought of Ron \u2014 Mrs. Weasley would kill him \u2014 and of how Hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her O.W.L.s. And it had been Seamus\u2019s very first meeting . . . and Neville had been getting so good. . . .\n\n\u201cFizzing Whizbee,\u201d sang Umbridge, and the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split open, and they ascended the moving stone staircase. They reached the polished door with the griffin knocker, but Umbridge did not bother to knock, she strode straight inside, still holding tight to Harry.\n\nThe office was full of people. Dumbledore was sitting behind his desk, his expression serene, the tips of his long fingers together. Professor McGonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face extremely tense. Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, was rocking backward and forward on his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with the situation. Kingsley Shacklebolt and a tough-looking wizard Harry did not recognize with very short, wiry hair were positioned on either side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of Percy Weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands, apparently poised to take notes.\n\nThe portraits of old headmasters and mistresses were not shamming sleep tonight. All of them were watching what was happening below, alert and serious. As Harry entered, a few flitted into neighboring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbors\u2019 ears.\n\nHarry pulled himself free of Umbridge\u2019s grasp as the door swung shut behind them. Cornelius Fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction upon his face.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, well, well . . .\u201d\n\nHarry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster. His heart drummed madly inside him, but his brain was oddly cool and clear.\n\n\u201cHe was heading back to Gryffindor Tower,\u201d said Umbridge. There was an indecent excitement in her voice, the same callous pleasure Harry had heard as she watched Professor Trelawney dissolving with misery in the entrance hall. \u201cThe Malfoy boy cornered him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he, did he?\u201d said Fudge appreciatively. \u201cI must remember to tell Lucius. Well, Potter . . . I expect you know why you are here?\u201d\n\nHarry fully intended to respond with a defiant \u201cyes\u201d: His mouth had opened and the word was half formed when he caught sight of Dumbledore\u2019s face. Dumbledore was not looking directly at Harry; his eyes were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder, but as Harry stared at him, he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side.\n\nHarry changed direction mid-word.\n\n\u201cYeh \u2014 no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d said Fudge.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, firmly.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know why you are here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry.\n\nFudge looked incredulously from Harry to Professor Umbridge; Harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at Dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink.\n\n\u201cSo you have no idea,\u201d said Fudge in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm, \u201cwhy Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office? You are not aware that you have broken any school rules?\u201d\n\n\u201cSchool rules?\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr Ministry decrees?\u201d amended Fudge angrily.\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d said Harry blandly.\n\nHis heart was still hammering very fast. It was almost worth telling these lies to watch Fudge\u2019s blood pressure rising, but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them. If somebody had tipped off Umbridge about the D.A. then he, the leader, might as well be packing his trunk right now.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s news to you, is it,\u201d said Fudge, his voice now thick with anger, \u201cthat an illegal student organization has been discovered within this school?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d said Harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise onto his face.\n\n\u201cI think, Minister,\u201d said Umbridge silkily from beside him, \u201cwe might make better progress if I fetch our informant.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, do,\u201d said Fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at Dumbledore as Umbridge left the room. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a good witness, is there, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing at all, Cornelius,\u201d said Dumbledore gravely, inclining his head.\n\nThere was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then Harry heard the door open behind him. Umbridge moved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder Cho\u2019s curly-haired friend Marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, dear, don\u2019t be frightened,\u201d said Professor Umbridge softly, patting her on the back, \u201cit\u2019s quite all right, now. You have done the right thing. The Minister is very pleased with you. He\u2019ll be telling your mother what a good girl you\u2019ve been. Marietta\u2019s mother, Minister,\u201d she added, looking up at Fudge, \u201cis Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation. Floo Network office \u2014 she\u2019s been helping us police the Hogwarts fires, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cJolly good, jolly good!\u201d said Fudge heartily. \u201cLike mother, like daughter, eh? Well, come on, now, dear, look up, don\u2019t be shy, let\u2019s hear what you\u2019ve got to \u2014 galloping gargoyles!\u201d\n\nAs Marietta raised her head, Fudge leapt backward in shock, nearly landing himself in the fire. He cursed and stamped on the hem of his cloak, which had started to smoke, and Marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before the whole room had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word \u201cSNEAK.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind the spots now, dear,\u201d said Umbridge impatiently, \u201cjust take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically.\n\n\u201cOh, very well, you silly girl, I\u2019ll tell him,\u201d snapped Umbridge. She hitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said, \u201cWell, Minister, Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me. She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the Room of Requirement, I would find out something to my advantage. I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortunately at that point this hex,\u201d she waved impatiently at Marietta\u2019s concealed face, \u201ccame into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now,\u201d said Fudge, fixing Marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look. \u201cIt is very brave of you, my dear, coming to tell Professor Umbridge, you did exactly the right thing. Now, will you tell me what happened at this meeting? What was its purpose? Who was there?\u201d\n\nBut Marietta would not speak. She merely shook her head again, her eyes wide and fearful.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t we got a counterjinx for this?\u201d Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently, gesturing at Marietta\u2019s face. \u201cSo she can speak freely?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not yet managed to find one,\u201d Umbridge admitted grudgingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione\u2019s jinxing ability. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter if she won\u2019t speak, I can take up the story from here.\n\n\u201cYou will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog\u2019s Head in Hogsmeade \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what is your evidence for that?\u201d cut in Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cI have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired,\u201d said Umbridge smugly. \u201cHe heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!\u201d said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. \u201cWhat an interesting insight into our justice system!\u201d\n\n\u201cBlatant corruption!\u201d roared the portrait of the corpulent, red-nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore\u2019s desk. \u201cThe Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Fortescue, that will do,\u201d said Dumbledore softly.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of Potter\u2019s meeting with these students,\u201d continued Professor Umbridge, \u201cwas to persuade them to join an illegal society, whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll find you\u2019re wrong there, Dolores,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly, peering at her over the half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose.\n\nHarry stared at him. He could not see how Dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one; if Willy Widdershins had indeed heard every word he said in the Hog\u2019s Head there was simply no escaping it.\n\n\u201cOho!\u201d said Fudge, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again. \u201cYes, do let\u2019s hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble! Go on, then, Dumbledore, go on \u2014 Willy Widdershins was lying, was he? Or was it Potter\u2019s identical twin in the Hog\u2019s Head that day? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time, a dead man coming back to life, and a couple of invisible dementors?\u201d\n\nPercy Weasley let out a hearty laugh.\n\n\u201cOh, very good, Minister, very good!\u201d\n\nHarry could have kicked him. Then he saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore was smiling gently too.\n\n\u201cCornelius, I do not deny \u2014 and nor, I am sure, does Harry \u2014 that he was in the Hog\u2019s Head that day, nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group. I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was, at that time, illegal. If you remember, the Ministry decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry\u2019s Hogsmeade meeting, so he was not breaking any rules in the Hog\u2019s Head at all.\u201d\n\nPercy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy. Fudge remained motionless in mid-bounce, his mouth hanging open.\n\nUmbridge recovered first.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all very fine, Headmaster,\u201d she said, smiling sweetly. \u201cBut we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all those that have happened since most certainly are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore, surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers, \u201cthey certainly would be, if they had continued after the decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence that these meetings continued?\u201d\n\nAs Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there.\n\n\u201cEvidence?\u201d repeated Umbridge with that horrible wide toadlike smile. \u201cHave you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, can she tell us about six months\u2019 worth of meetings?\u201d said Dumbledore, raising his eyebrows. \u201cI was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Edgecombe,\u201d said Umbridge at once, \u201ctell us how long these meetings have been going on, dear. You can simply nod or shake your head, I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t make the spots worse. Have they been happening regularly over the last six months?\u201d\n\nHarry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach. This was it, they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even Dumbledore would be able to shift aside. . . .\n\n\u201cJust nod or shake your head, dear,\u201d Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta. \u201cCome on, now, that won\u2019t activate the jinx further . . .\u201d\n\nEveryone in the room was gazing at the top of Marietta\u2019s face. Only her eyes were visible between the pulled up robes and her curly fringe. Perhaps it was a trick of the firelight, but her eyes looked oddly blank. And then \u2014 to Harry\u2019s utter amazement \u2014 Marietta shook her head.\n\nUmbridge looked quickly at Fudge and then back at Marietta.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you understood the question, did you, dear? I\u2019m asking whether you\u2019ve been going to these meetings for the past six months? You have, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAgain, Marietta shook her head.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by shaking your head, dear?\u201d said Umbridge in a testy voice.\n\n\u201cI would have thought her meaning was quite clear,\u201d said Professor McGonagall harshly. \u201cThere have been no secret meetings for the past six months. Is that correct, Miss Edgecombe?\u201d\n\nMarietta nodded.\n\n\u201cBut there was a meeting tonight!\u201d said Umbridge furiously. \u201cThere was a meeting, Miss Edgecombe, you told me about it, in the Room of Requirement! And Potter was the leader, was he not, Potter organized it, Potter \u2014 why are you shaking your head, girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, usually when a person shakes their head,\u201d said McGonagall coldly, \u201cthey mean \u2018no.\u2019 So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign language as yet unknown to humans \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge seized Marietta, pulled her around to face her, and began shaking her very hard. A split second later Dumbledore was on his feet, his wand raised. Kingsley started forward and Umbridge leapt back from Marietta, waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned.\n\n\u201cI cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores,\u201d said Dumbledore, and for the first time, he looked angry.\n\n\u201cYou want to calm yourself, Madam Umbridge,\u201d said Kingsley in his deep, slow voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get yourself into trouble now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Umbridge breathlessly, glancing up at the towering figure of Kingsley. \u201cI mean, yes \u2014 you\u2019re right, Shacklebolt \u2014 I \u2014 I forgot myself.\u201d\n\nMarietta was standing exactly where Umbridge had released her. She seemed neither perturbed by Umbridge\u2019s sudden attack, nor relieved by her release. She was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes, staring straight ahead of her. A sudden suspicion connected to Kingsley\u2019s whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him sprang into Harry\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cDolores,\u201d said Fudge, with the air of trying to settle something once and for all, \u201cthe meeting tonight \u2014 the one we know definitely happened \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Umbridge, pulling herself together, \u201cyes . . . well, Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor, accompanied by certain trustworthy students, so as to catch those in the meeting red-handed. It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival, however, because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction. It does not matter, however. I have all their names here, Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind. . . . We needed evidence and the room provided . . .\u201d\n\nAnd to Harry\u2019s horror, she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the Room of Requirement\u2019s wall and handed it to Fudge.\n\n\u201cThe moment I saw Potter\u2019s name on the list, I knew what we were dealing with,\u201d she said softly.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Fudge, a smile spreading across his face. \u201cExcellent, Dolores. And . . . by thunder . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked up at Dumbledore, who was still standing beside Marietta, his wand held loosely in his hand.\n\n\u201cSee what they\u2019ve named themselves?\u201d said Fudge quietly. \u201cDumbledore\u2019s Army.\u201d\n\nDumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from Fudge. He gazed at the heading scribbled by Hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak. Then he looked up, smiling.\n\n\u201cWell, the game is up,\u201d he said simply. \u201cWould you like a written confession from me, Cornelius \u2014 or will a statement before these witnesses suffice?\u201d\n\nHarry saw McGonagall and Kingsley look at each other. There was fear in both faces. He did not understand what was going on, and neither, apparently, did Fudge.\n\n\u201cStatement?\u201d said Fudge slowly. \u201cWhat \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s Army, Cornelius,\u201d said Dumbledore, still smiling as he waved the list of names before Fudge\u2019s face. \u201cNot Potter\u2019s Army. Dumbledore\u2019s Army.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 but \u2014\u201d\n\nUnderstanding blazed suddenly in Fudge\u2019s face. He took a horrified step backward, yelped, and jumped out of the fire again.\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d he whispered, stamping again on his smoldering cloak.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Dumbledore pleasantly.\n\n\u201cYou organized this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYou recruited these students for \u2014 for your army?\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight was supposed to be the first meeting,\u201d said Dumbledore, nodding. \u201cMerely to see whether they would be interested in joining me. I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe, of course.\u201d\n\nMarietta nodded. Fudge looked from her to Dumbledore, his chest swelling.\n\n\u201cThen you have been plotting against me!\u201d he yelled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Dumbledore cheerfully.\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d shouted Harry.\n\nKingsley flashed a look of warning at him, McGonagall widened her eyes threateningly, but it had suddenly dawned upon Harry what Dumbledore was about to do, and he could not let it happen.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 Professor Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Harry, or I am afraid you will have to leave my office,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly.\n\n\u201cYes, shut up, Potter!\u201d barked Fudge, who was still ogling Dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight. \u201cWell, well, well \u2014 I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead you get to arrest me,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWeasley!\u201d cried Fudge, now positively quivering with delight, \u201cWeasley, have you written it all down, everything he\u2019s said, his confession, have you got it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I think so, sir!\u201d said Percy eagerly, whose nose was splattered with ink from the speed of his note-taking.\n\n\u201cThe bit about how he\u2019s been trying to build up an army against the Ministry, how he\u2019s been working to destabilize me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I\u2019ve got it, yes!\u201d said Percy, scanning his notes joyfully.\n\n\u201cVery well, then,\u201d said Fudge, now radiant with glee. \u201cDuplicate your notes, Weasley, and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once. If we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition!\u201d Percy dashed from the room, slamming the door behind him, and Fudge turned back to Dumbledore. \u201cYou will now be escorted back to the Ministry, where you will be formally charged and then sent to Azkaban to await trial!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Dumbledore gently, \u201cyes. Yes, I thought we might hit that little snag.\u201d\n\n\u201cSnag?\u201d said Fudge, his voice still vibrating with joy. \u201cI see no snag, Dumbledore!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh really?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 it\u2019s just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to \u2014 what is the phrase? \u2018Come quietly.\u2019 I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all, Cornelius. I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban. I could break out, of course \u2014 but what a waste of time, and frankly, I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing.\u201d\n\nUmbridge\u2019s face was growing steadily redder, she looked as though she was being filled with boiling water. Fudge stared at Dumbledore with a very silly expression on his face, as though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened. He made a small choking noise and then looked around at Kingsley and the man with short gray hair, who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far. The latter gave Fudge a reassuring nod and moved forward a little, away from the wall. Harry saw his hand drift, almost casually, toward his pocket.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Dawlish,\u201d said Dumbledore kindly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you are an excellent Auror, I seem to remember that you achieved \u2018Outstanding\u2019 in all your N.E.W.T.s, but if you attempt to \u2014 er \u2014 \u2018bring me in\u2019 by force, I will have to hurt you.\u201d\n\nThe man called Dawlish blinked, looking rather foolish. He looked toward Fudge again, but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d sneered Fudge, recovering himself, \u201cyou intend to take on Dawlish, Shacklebolt, Dolores, and myself single-handed, do you, Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cMerlin\u2019s beard, no,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cNot unless you are foolish enough to force me to.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will not be single-handed!\u201d said Professor McGonagall loudly, plunging her hand inside her robes.\n\n\u201cOh yes he will, Minerva!\u201d said Dumbledore sharply. \u201cHogwarts needs you!\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough of this rubbish!\u201d said Fudge, pulling out his own wand. \u201cDawlish! Shacklebolt! Take him!\u201d\n\nA streak of silver light flashed around the room. There was a bang like a gunshot, and the floor trembled. A hand grabbed the scruff of Harry\u2019s neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash went off \u2014 several of the portraits yelled, Fawkes screeched, and a cloud of dust filled the air. Coughing in the dust, Harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him. There was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried, \u201cNo!\u201d Then the sound of breaking glass, frantically scuffling footsteps, a groan \u2014 and silence.\n\nHarry struggled around to see who was half-strangling him and saw Professor McGonagall crouched beside him. She had forced both him and Marietta out of harm\u2019s way. Dust was still floating gently down through the air onto them. Panting slightly, Harry saw a very tall figure moving toward them.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d said Professor McGonagall, getting up and dragging Harry and Marietta with her.\n\nThe dust was clearing. The wreckage of the office loomed into view: Dumbledore\u2019s desk had been overturned, all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor, their silver instruments in pieces. Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley, and Dawlish lay motionless on the floor. Fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them, singing softly.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I had to hex Kingsley too, or it would have looked very suspicious,\u201d said Dumbledore in a low voice. \u201cHe was remarkably quick on the uptake, modifying Miss Edgecombe\u2019s memory like that while everyone was looking the other way \u2014 thank him for me, won\u2019t you, Minerva?\n\n\u201cNow, they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate \u2014 you must act as though no time has passed, as though they were merely knocked to the ground, they will not remember \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere will you go, Dumbledore?\u201d whispered Professor McGonagall. \u201cGrimmauld Place?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Dumbledore with a grim smile. \u201cI am not leaving to go into hiding. Fudge will soon wish he\u2019d never dislodged me from Hogwarts, I promise you . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore . . .\u201d Harry began.\n\nHe did not know what to say first: how sorry he was that he had started the D.A. in the first place and caused all this trouble, or how terrible he felt that Dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion? But Dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word.\n\n\u201cListen to me, Harry,\u201d he said urgently, \u201cyou must study Occlumency as hard as you can, do you understand me? Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams \u2014 you will understand why soon enough, but you must promise me \u2014\u201d\n\nThe man called Dawlish was stirring. Dumbledore seized Harry\u2019s wrist.\n\n\u201cRemember \u2014 close your mind \u2014\u201d\n\nBut as Dumbledore\u2019s fingers closed over Harry\u2019s skin, a pain shot through the scar on his forehead, and he felt again that terrible, snakelike longing to strike Dumbledore, to bite him, to hurt him \u2014\n\n\u201c\u2014 you will understand,\u201d whispered Dumbledore.\n\nFawkes circled the office and swooped low over him. Dumbledore released Harry, raised his hand, and grasped the phoenix\u2019s long golden tail. There was a flash of fire and the pair of them had gone.\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d yelled Fudge, pushing himself up from the ground. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d shouted Kingsley, also leaping to his feet.\n\n\u201cWell, he can\u2019t have Disapparated!\u201d cried Umbridge. \u201cYou can\u2019t inside this school \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stairs!\u201d cried Dawlish, and he flung himself upon the door, wrenched it open, and disappeared, followed closely by Kingsley and Umbridge. Fudge hesitated, then got to his feet slowly, brushing dust from his front. There was a long and painful silence.\n\n\u201cWell, Minerva,\u201d said Fudge nastily, straightening his torn shirtsleeve, \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think so, do you?\u201d said Professor McGonagall scornfully.\n\nFudge seemed not to hear her. He was looking around at the wrecked office. A few of the portraits hissed at him; one or two even made rude hand gestures.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get those two off to bed,\u201d said Fudge, looking back at Professor McGonagall with a dismissive nod toward Harry and Marietta.\n\nShe said nothing, but marched Harry and Marietta to the door. As it swung closed behind them, Harry heard Phineas Nigellus\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cYou know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts . . . but you cannot deny he\u2019s got style . . .\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter28": "SNAPE\u2019S WORST MEMORY\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 BY ORDER OF \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Magic\n\n\n\n\nDolores Jane Umbridge (High Inquisitor) has replaced Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\n\n\nThe above is in accordance with Educational Decree Number Twenty-eight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe notices had gone up all over the school overnight, but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that Dumbledore had overcome two Aurors, the High Inquisitor, the Minister of Magic, and his Junior Assistant to escape. No matter where Harry went within the castle next day, the sole topic of conversation was Dumbledore\u2019s flight, and though some of the details might have gone awry in the retelling (Harry overheard one second-year girl assuring another that Fudge was now lying in St. Mungo\u2019s with a pumpkin for a head), it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was. Everybody seemed aware, for instance, that Harry and Marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in Dumbledore\u2019s office, and as Marietta was now in the hospital wing, Harry found himself besieged with requests to give a firsthand account wherever he went.\n\n\u201cDumbledore will be back before long,\u201d said Ernie Macmillan confidently on the way back from Herbology after listening intently to Harry\u2019s story. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t keep him away in our second year and they won\u2019t be able to this time. The Fat Friar told me . . .\u201d He dropped his voice conspiratorially, so that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to lean closer to him to hear, \u201c. . . that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they\u2019d searched the castle and grounds for him. Couldn\u2019t get past the gargoyle. The Head\u2019s office has sealed itself against her.\u201d Ernie smirked. \u201cApparently she had a right little tantrum . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head\u2019s office,\u201d said Hermione viciously, as they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall. \u201cLording it over all the other teachers, the stupid puffed-up, power-crazy old \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, do you really want to finish that sentence, Granger?\u201d\n\nDraco Malfoy had slid out from behind the door, followed by Crabbe and Goyle. His pale, pointed face was alight with malice.\n\n\u201cAfraid I\u2019m going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff,\u201d he drawled.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take points from fellow prefects, Malfoy,\u201d said Ernie at once.\n\n\u201cI know prefects can\u2019t dock points from each other,\u201d sneered Malfoy; Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. \u201cBut members of the Inquisitorial Squad \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d said Hermione sharply.\n\n\u201cThe Inquisitorial Squad, Granger,\u201d said Malfoy, pointing toward a tiny silver I upon his robes just beneath his prefect\u2019s badge. \u201cA select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic, hand-picked by Professor Umbridge. Anyway, members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points. . . . So, Granger, I\u2019ll have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress. . . . Macmillan, five for contradicting me. . . . Five because I don\u2019t like you, Potter . . . Weasley, your shirt\u2019s untucked, so I\u2019ll have another five for that. . . . Oh yeah, I forgot, you\u2019re a Mudblood, Granger, so ten for that . . .\u201d\n\nRon pulled out his wand, but Hermione pushed it away, whispering, \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cWise move, Granger,\u201d breathed Malfoy. \u201cNew Head, new times . . . Be good now, Potty . . . Weasel King . . .\u201d\n\nHe strode away, laughing heartily with Crabbe and Goyle.\n\n\u201cHe was bluffing,\u201d said Ernie, looking appalled. \u201cHe can\u2019t be allowed to dock points . . . that would be ridiculous. . . . It would completely undermine the prefect system . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry, Ron, and Hermione had turned automatically toward the giant hourglasses set in niches along the wall behind them, which recorded the House points. Gryffindor and Ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning. Even as they watched, stones flew upward, reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs. In fact, the only glass that seemed unchanged was the emerald-filled one of Slytherin.\n\n\u201cNoticed, have you?\u201d said Fred\u2019s voice.\n\nHe and George had just come down the marble staircase and joined Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie in front of the hourglasses.\n\n\u201cMalfoy just docked us all about fifty points,\u201d said Harry furiously, as they watched several more stones fly upward from the Gryffindor hourglass.\n\n\u201cYeah, Montague tried to do us during break,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018tried\u2019?\u201d said Ron quickly.\n\n\u201cHe never managed to get all the words out,\u201d said Fred, \u201cdue to the fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor.\u201d\n\nHermione looked very shocked.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll get into terrible trouble!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot until Montague reappears, and that could take weeks, I dunno where we sent him,\u201d said Fred coolly. \u201cAnyway . . . we\u2019ve decided we don\u2019t care about getting into trouble anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever?\u201d asked Hermione.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course we have,\u201d said George. \u201cNever been expelled, have we?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always known where to draw the line,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cWe might have put a toe across it occasionally,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cBut now?\u201d said Ron tentatively.\n\n\u201cWell, now \u2014\u201d said George.\n\n\u201c\u2014 what with Dumbledore gone \u2014\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201c\u2014 we reckon a bit of mayhem \u2014\u201d said George.\n\n\u201c\u2014 is exactly what our dear new Head deserves,\u201d said Fred.\n\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t!\u201d whispered Hermione. \u201cYou really mustn\u2019t! She\u2019d love a reason to expel you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, Hermione, do you?\u201d said Fred, smiling at her. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about staying anymore. We\u2019d walk out right now if we weren\u2019t determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first. So anyway,\u201d he checked his watch, \u201cphase one is about to begin. I\u2019d get in the Great Hall for lunch if I were you, that way the teachers will see you can\u2019t have had anything to do with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything to do with what?\u201d said Hermione anxiously.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d said George. \u201cRun along, now.\u201d\n\nFred and George turned away and disappeared in the swelling crowd descending the stairs toward lunch. Looking highly disconcerted, Ernie muttered something about unfinished Transfiguration homework and scurried away.\n\n\u201cI think we should get out of here, you know,\u201d said Hermione nervously. \u201cJust in case . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d said Ron, and the three of them moved toward the doors to the Great Hall, but Harry had barely glimpsed today\u2019s ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and, turning, he found himself almost nose to nose with Filch, the caretaker. He took several hasty steps backward; Filch was best viewed at a distance.\n\n\u201cThe headmistress would like to see you, Potter,\u201d he leered.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Harry stupidly, thinking of whatever Fred and George were planning. Filch\u2019s jowls wobbled with silent laughter.\n\n\u201cGuilty conscience, eh?\u201d he wheezed. \u201cFollow me . . .\u201d\n\nHarry glanced back at Ron and Hermione, who were both looking worried. He shrugged and followed Filch back into the entrance hall, against the tide of hungry students.\n\nFilch seemed to be in an extremely good mood; he hummed creakily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase. As they reached the first landing he said, \u201cThings are changing around here, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed,\u201d said Harry coldly.\n\n\u201cYerse . . . I\u2019ve been telling Dumbledore for years and years he\u2019s too soft with you all,\u201d said Filch, chuckling nastily. \u201cYou filthy little beasts would never have dropped Stinkpellets if you\u2019d known I had it in my power to whip you raw, would you, now? Nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I could\u2019ve strung you up by the ankles in my office, would they? But when Educational Decree Twenty-nine comes in, Potter, I\u2019ll be allowed to do them things. . . . And she\u2019s asked the Minister to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves. . . . Oh, things are going to be very different around here with her in charge . . .\u201d\n\nUmbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her side, Harry thought, and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon; his knowledge of the school\u2019s secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to the Weasley twins.\n\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, leering down at Harry as he rapped three times upon Professor Umbridge\u2019s door and pushed it open. \u201cThe Potter boy to see you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nUmbridge\u2019s office, so very familiar to Harry from his many detentions, was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word HEADMISTRESS; also his Firebolt, and Fred\u2019s and George\u2019s Cleansweeps, which he saw with a pang were now chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk. Umbridge was sitting behind the desk, busily scribbling upon some of her pink parchment, but looked up and smiled widely at their entrance.\n\n\u201cThank you, Argus,\u201d she said sweetly.\n\n\u201cNot at all, ma\u2019am, not at all,\u201d said Filch, bowing as low as his rheumatism would permit, and exiting backward.\n\n\u201cSit,\u201d said Umbridge curtly, pointing toward a chair, and Harry sat. She continued to scribble for a few moments. He watched some of the foul kittens gamboling around the plates over her head, wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him.\n\n\u201cWell now,\u201d she said finally, setting down her quill and looking like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly. \u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, quite sure he had misheard her.\n\n\u201cTo drink, Mr. Potter,\u201d she said, smiling still more widely. \u201cTea? Coffee? Pumpkin juice?\u201d\n\nAs she named each drink, she gave her short wand a wave, and a cup or glass of it appeared upon her desk.\n\n\u201cNothing, thank you,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI wish you to have a drink with me,\u201d she said, her voice becoming more dangerously sweet. \u201cChoose one.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine . . . tea then,\u201d said Harry, shrugging.\n\nShe got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him. She then bustled around the desk with it, smiling in sinisterly sweet fashion.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d she said, handing it to him. \u201cDrink it before it gets cold, won\u2019t you? Well, now, Mr. Potter . . . I thought we ought to have a little chat, after the distressing events of last night.\u201d\n\nHe said nothing. She settled herself back into her seat and waited. When several long moments had passed in silence, she said gaily, \u201cYou\u2019re not drinking up!\u201d\n\nHe raised the cup to his lips and then, just as suddenly, lowered it. One of the horrible painted kittens behind Umbridge had great round blue eyes just like Mad-Eye Moody\u2019s magical one, and it had just occurred to Harry what Mad-Eye would say if he ever heard that Harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Umbridge, who was still watching him. \u201cDo you want sugar?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip, though keeping his mouth tightly closed. Umbridge\u2019s smile widened.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she whispered. \u201cVery good. Now then . . .\u201d She leaned forward a little. \u201cWhere is Albus Dumbledore?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Harry promptly.\n\n\u201cDrink up, drink up,\u201d she said, still smiling. \u201cNow, Mr. Potter, let us not play childish games. I know that you know where he has gone. You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning. Consider your position, Mr. Potter . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d\n\nHarry pretended to drink again.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Umbridge, looking displeased. \u201cIn that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer. He tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together, so that some of the hot liquid trickled down onto his robes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said a little too quickly.\n\n\u201cMr. Potter,\u201d said Umbridge, \u201clet me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October. I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today, I promise you. I repeat, Mr. Potter . . . Where is Sirius Black?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d said Harry loudly. \u201cHaven\u2019t got a clue.\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other so long that Harry felt his eyes watering. Then she stood up.\n\n\u201cVery well, Potter, I will take your word for it this time, but be warned: The might of the Ministry stands behind me. All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored. A Floo Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts \u2014 except my own, of course. My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle. And Mr. Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle. If I find a shred of evidence . . .\u201d\n\nBOOM!\n\nThe very floor of the office shook; Umbridge slipped sideways, clutching her desk for support, looking shocked.\n\n\u201cWhat was \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nShe was gazing toward the door; Harry took the opportunity to empty his almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers. He could hear people running and screaming several floors below.\n\n\u201cBack to lunch with you, Potter!\u201d cried Umbridge, raising her wand and dashing out of the office. Harry gave her a few seconds\u2019 start then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was.\n\nIt was not difficult to find. One floor down, pandemonium reigned. Somebody (and Harry had a very shrewd idea who) had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks.\n\nDragons comprised entirely of green-and-gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors, emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went. Shocking-pink Catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers. Rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls. Sparklers were writing swearwords in midair of their own accord. Firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere Harry looked, and instead of burning themselves out, fading from sight, or fizzling to a halt, these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched.\n\nFilch and Umbridge were standing, apparently transfixed with horror, halfway down the stairs. As Harry watched, one of the larger Catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to maneuver; it whirled toward Umbridge and Filch with a sinister wheeeeeeeeee. Both adults yelled with fright and ducked and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds. Meanwhile, several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape toward the second floor.\n\n\u201cHurry, Filch, hurry!\u201d shrieked Umbridge. \u201cThey\u2019ll be all over the school unless we do something \u2014 Stupefy!\u201d\n\nA jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets. Instead of freezing in midair, it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppy-looking witch in the middle of a meadow \u2014 she ran for it just in time, reappearing seconds later squashed into the painting next door, where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Stun them, Filch!\u201d shouted Umbridge angrily, for all the world as though it had been his suggestion.\n\n\u201cRight you are, Headmistress!\u201d wheezed Filch, who was a Squib and could no more have Stunned the fireworks than swallowed them. He dashed to a nearby cupboard, pulled out a broom, and began swatting at the fireworks in midair; within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze.\n\nHarry had seen enough. Laughing, he ducked down low, ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find Fred and George hiding just behind it, listening to Umbridge\u2019s and Filch\u2019s yells and quaking with suppressed mirth.\n\n\u201cImpressive,\u201d Harry said quietly, grinning. \u201cVery impressive . . . You\u2019ll put Dr. Filibuster out of business, no problem . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCheers,\u201d whispered George, wiping tears of laughter from his face. \u201cOh, I hope she tries Vanishing them next. . . . They multiply by ten every time you try . . .\u201d\n\nThe fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon. Though they caused plenty of disruption, particularly the firecrackers, the other teachers did not seem to mind them very much.\n\n\u201cDear, dear,\u201d said Professor McGonagall sardonically, as one of the dragons soared around her classroom, emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame. \u201cMiss Brown, would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom?\u201d\n\nThe upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her. When the final bell rang and the students were heading back to Gryffindor Tower with their bags, Harry saw, with immense satisfaction, a disheveled and soot-blackened Umbridge tottering sweaty-faced from Professor Flitwick\u2019s classroom.\n\n\u201cThank you so much, Professor!\u201d said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice. \u201cI could have got rid of the sparklers myself, of course, but I wasn\u2019t sure whether I had the authority . . .\u201d\n\nBeaming, he closed his classroom door in her snarling face.\n\nFred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room. Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd around them to congratulate them.\n\n\u201cThey were wonderful fireworks,\u201d she said admiringly.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d said George, looking both surprised and pleased. \u201cWeasleys\u2019 Wildfire Whiz-Bangs. Only thing is, we used our whole stock, we\u2019re going to have to start again from scratch now . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was worth it, though,\u201d said Fred, who was taking orders from clamoring Gryffindors. \u201cIf you want to add your name to the waiting list, Hermione, it\u2019s five Galleons for your Basic Blaze box and twenty for the Deflagration Deluxe . . .\u201d\n\nHermione returned to the table where Harry and Ron were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework might spring out of it and start doing itself.\n\n\u201cOh, why don\u2019t we have a night off?\u201d said Hermione brightly, as a silver-tailed Weasley rocket zoomed past the window. \u201cAfter all, the Easter holidays start on Friday, we\u2019ll have plenty of time then . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d Ron asked, staring at her in disbelief.\n\n\u201cNow you mention it,\u201d said Hermione happily, \u201cd\u2019you know . . . I think I\u2019m feeling a bit . . . rebellious.\u201d\n\nHarry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and Ron went up to bed an hour later, and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower, still resolutely spelling out the word \u201cPOO\u201d.\n\nHe got into bed, yawning. With his glasses off, the occasional firework still passing the window became blurred, looking like sparkling clouds, beautiful and mysterious against the black sky. He turned onto his side, wondering how Umbridge was feeling about her first day in Dumbledore\u2019s job, and how Fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption. . . . Smiling to himself, he closed his eyes. . . .\n\nThe whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant . . . or perhaps he, Harry, was simply speeding away from them. . . .\n\nHe had fallen right into the corridor leading to the Department of Mysteries. He was speeding toward the plain black door. . . . Let it open. . . . Let it open. . . .\n\nIt did. He was inside the circular room lined with doors. . . . He crossed it, placed his hand upon an identical door, and it swung inward. . . .\n\nNow he was in a long, rectangular room full of an odd, mechanical clicking. There were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate. . . . He had to go on. . . .\n\nThere was a door at the far end. . . . It too opened at his touch. . . .\n\nAnd now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church, full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves, each laden with small, dusty, spun-glass spheres. . . . Now Harry\u2019s heart was beating fast with excitement. . . . He knew where to go. . . . He ran forward, but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous, deserted room. . . .\n\nThere was something in this room he wanted very, very much. . . .\n\nSomething he wanted. . . . or somebody else wanted. . . .\n\nHis scar was hurting. . . .\n\nBANG! Harry awoke instantly, confused and angry. The dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter.\n\n\u201cCool!\u201d said Seamus, who was silhouetted against the window. \u201cI think one of those Catherine wheels hit a rocket and it\u2019s like they mated, come and see!\u201d\n\nHarry heard Ron and Dean scramble out of bed for a better look. He lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him. He felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment. . . . He had got so close that time. . . .\n\nGlittering, pink-and-silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of Gryffindor Tower. Harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of Gryffindors in the dormitories below them. His stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had Occlumency the following evening. . . .\n\n\nHarry spent the whole of the next day dreading what Snape was going to say if he found out how much farther into the Department of Mysteries he had penetrated during his last dream. With a surge of guilt he realized that he had not practiced Occlumency once since their last lesson: There had been too much going on since Dumbledore had left. He was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried. He doubted, however, whether Snape would accept that excuse. . . .\n\nHe attempted a little last-minute practice during classes that day, but it was no good, Hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and, after all, the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing review questions at the class.\n\nResigned to the worst, he set off for Snape\u2019s office after dinner. Halfway across the entrance hall, however, Cho came hurrying up to him.\n\n\u201cOver here,\u201d said Harry, glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with Snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant hourglasses stood. Gryffindor\u2019s was now almost empty. \u201cAre you okay? Umbridge hasn\u2019t been asking you about the D.A., has she?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Cho hurriedly. \u201cNo, it was only . . . Well, I just wanted to say . . . Harry, I never dreamed Marietta would tell . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d said Harry moodily. He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully. It was small consolation that the last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely person really,\u201d said Cho. \u201cShe just made a mistake \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry looked at her incredulously.\n\n\u201cA lovely person who made a mistake? She sold us all out, including you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . we all got away, didn\u2019t we?\u201d said Cho pleadingly. \u201cYou know, her mum works for the Ministry, it\u2019s really difficult for her \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRon\u2019s dad works for the Ministry too!\u201d Harry said furiously. \u201cAnd in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, he hasn\u2019t got \u2018sneak\u2019 written across his face \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger\u2019s,\u201d said Cho fiercely. \u201cShe should have told us she\u2019d jinxed that list \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was a brilliant idea,\u201d said Harry coldly. Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter.\n\n\u201cOh yes, I forgot \u2014 of course, if it was darling Hermione\u2019s idea \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t start crying again,\u201d said Harry warningly.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to!\u201d she shouted.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . well . . . good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got enough to cope with at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo and cope with it then!\u201d she said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off.\n\nFuming, Harry descended the stairs to Snape\u2019s dungeon, and though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for Snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful, he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good things he should have said to Cho about Marietta before reaching the dungeon door.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late, Potter,\u201d said Snape coldly, as Harry closed the door behind him.\n\nSnape was standing with his back to Harry, removing, as usual, certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve. He dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face Harry.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you been practicing?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Harry lied, looking carefully at one of the legs of Snape\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll soon find out, won\u2019t we?\u201d said Snape smoothly. \u201cWand out, Potter.\u201d\n\nHarry moved into his usual position, facing Snape with the desk between them. His heart was pumping fast with anger at Cho and anxiety about how much Snape was about to extract from his mind.\n\n\u201cOn the count of three then,\u201d said Snape lazily. \u201cOne \u2014 two \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s office door banged open and Draco Malfoy sped in.\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, sir \u2014 oh \u2014 sorry \u2014\u201d\n\nMalfoy was looking at Snape and Harry in some surprise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Draco,\u201d said Snape, lowering his wand. \u201cPotter is here for a little Remedial Potions.\u201d\n\nHarry had not seen Malfoy look so gleeful since Umbridge had turned up to inspect Hagrid.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said, leering at Harry, who knew his face was burning. He would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at Malfoy \u2014 or, even better, to hit him with a good curse.\n\n\u201cWell, Draco, what is it?\u201d asked Snape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Professor Umbridge, sir \u2014 she needs your help,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cThey\u2019ve found Montague, sir. He\u2019s turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he get in there?\u201d demanded Snape.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir, he\u2019s a bit confused . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, very well \u2014 Potter,\u201d said Snape, \u201cwe shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening instead.\u201d\n\nHe turned and swept from his office. Malfoy mouthed \u201cRemedial Potions?\u201d at Harry behind Snape\u2019s back before following him.\n\nSeething, Harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room. At least he had twenty-four more hours in which to practice; he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape, though it was hard that it came at the expense of Malfoy telling the whole school that he needed Remedial Potions. . . .\n\nHe was at the office door when he saw it: a patch of shivering light dancing on the door frame. He stopped, looking at it, reminded of something. . . . Then he remembered: It was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night, the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the Department of Mysteries.\n\nHe turned around. The light was coming from the Pensieve sitting on Snape\u2019s desk. The silver-white contents were ebbing and swirling within. Snape\u2019s thoughts . . . things he did not want Harry to see if he broke through Snape\u2019s defenses accidentally. . . .\n\nHarry gazed at the Pensieve, curiosity welling inside him. . . . What was it that Snape was so keen to hide from Harry?\n\nThe silvery lights shivered on the wall. . . . Harry took two steps toward the desk, thinking hard. Could it possibly be information about the Department of Mysteries that Snape was determined to keep from him?\n\nHarry looked over his shoulder, his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever. How long would it take Snape to release Montague from the toilet? Would he come straight back to his office afterward, or accompany Montague to the hospital wing? Surely the latter . . . Montague was Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, Snape would want to make sure he was all right. . . .\n\nHarry walked the remaining few feet to the Pensieve and stood over it, gazing into its depths. He hesitated, listening, then pulled out his wand again. The office and the corridor beyond were completely silent. He gave the contents of the Pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand.\n\nThe silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast. Harry leaned forward over it and saw that it had become transparent. He was, once again, looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling. . . . In fact, unless he was much mistaken, he was looking down upon the Great Hall. . . .\n\nHis breath was actually fogging the surface of Snape\u2019s thoughts. . . . His brain seemed to be in limbo. . . . It would be insane to do the thing that he was so strongly tempted to do . . . He was trembling. . . . Snape could be back at any moment . . . but Harry thought of Cho\u2019s anger, of Malfoy\u2019s jeering face, and a reckless daring seized him.\n\nHe took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface of Snape\u2019s thoughts. At once, the floor of the office lurched, tipping Harry headfirst into the Pensieve. . . .\n\nHe was falling through cold blackness, spinning furiously as he went, and then \u2014\n\nHe was standing in the middle of the Great Hall, but the four House tables were gone. Instead there were more than a hundred smaller tables, all facing the same way, at each of which sat a student, head bent low, scribbling on a roll of parchment. The only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment. It was clearly exam time.\n\nSunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light. Harry looked around carefully. Snape had to be here somewhere. . . . This was his memory. . . .\n\nAnd there he was, at a table right behind Harry. Harry stared. Snape-the-teenager had a stringy, pallid look about him, like a plant kept in the dark. His hair was lank and greasy and was flopping onto the table, his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled. Harry moved around behind Snape and read the heading of the examination paper:\n\nDEFENSE AGAINST THE DARK ARTS \u2014 ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL\n\n\n\nSo Snape had to be fifteen or sixteen, around Harry\u2019s own age. His hand was flying across the parchment; he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbors, and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped.\n\n\u201cFive more minutes!\u201d\n\nThe voice made Harry jump; turning, he saw the top of Professor Flitwick\u2019s head moving between the desks a short distance away. Professor Flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair . . . very untidy black hair. . . .\n\nHarry moved so quickly that, had he been solid, he would have knocked desks flying. Instead he seemed to slide, dreamlike, across two aisles and up a third. The back of the black-haired boy\u2019s head drew nearer and nearer. . . . He was straightening up now, putting down his quill, pulling his roll of parchment toward him so as to reread what he had written. . . .\n\nHarry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-year-old father.\n\nExcitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: It was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James\u2019s eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry\u2019s, and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows. James\u2019s hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry\u2019s did, his hands could have been Harry\u2019s, and Harry could tell that when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other\u2019s heights.\n\nJames yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair, making it even messier than it had been. Then, with a glance toward Professor Flitwick, he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him.\n\nWith another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James\u2019s nor Harry\u2019s could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn\u2019t seem to have noticed. And two seats along from this girl \u2014 Harry\u2019s stomach gave another pleasurable squirm \u2014 was Remus Lupin. He looked rather pale and peaky (was the full moon approaching?) and was absorbed in the exam: As he reread his answers he scratched his chin with the end of his quill, frowning slightly.\n\nSo that meant Wormtail had to be around here somewhere too . . . and sure enough, Harry spotted him within seconds: a small, mousy-haired boy with a pointed nose. Wormtail looked anxious; he was chewing his fingernails, staring down at his paper, scuffing the ground with his toes. Every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neighbor\u2019s paper. Harry stared at Wormtail for a moment, then back at James, who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment. He had drawn a Snitch and was now tracing the letters L. E. What did they stand for?\n\n\u201cQuills down, please!\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick. \u201cThat means you too, Stebbins! Please remain seated while I collect your parchment! Accio!\u201d\n\nMore than a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into Professor Flitwick\u2019s outstretched arms, knocking him backward off his feet. Several people laughed. A couple of students at the front desks got up, took hold of Professor Flitwick beneath the elbows, and lifted him onto his feet again.\n\n\u201cThank you . . . thank you,\u201d panted Professor Flitwick. \u201cVery well, everybody, you\u2019re free to go!\u201d\n\nHarry looked down at his father, who had hastily crossed out the L. E. he had been embellishing, jumped to his feet, stuffed his quill and the exam question paper into his bag, which he slung over his back, and stood waiting for Sirius to join him.\n\nHarry looked around and glimpsed Snape a short way away, moving between the tables toward the doors into the entrance hall, still absorbed in his own examination paper. Round-shouldered yet angular, he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider, his oily hair swinging about his face.\n\nA gang of chattering girls separated Snape from James and Sirius, and by planting himself in the midst of this group, Harry managed to keep Snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of James and his friends.\n\n\u201cDid you like question ten, Moony?\u201d asked Sirius as they emerged into the entrance hall.\n\n\u201cLoved it,\u201d said Lupin briskly. \u201c\u2018Give five signs that identify the werewolf.\u2019 Excellent question.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think you managed to get all the signs?\u201d said James in tones of mock concern.\n\n\u201cThink I did,\u201d said Lupin seriously, as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds. \u201cOne: He\u2019s sitting on my chair. Two: He\u2019s wearing my clothes. Three: His name\u2019s Remus Lupin . . .\u2019\u201d\n\nWormtail was the only one who didn\u2019t laugh.\n\n\u201cI got the snout shape, the pupils of the eyes, and the tufted tail,\u201d he said anxiously, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t think what else \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow thick are you, Wormtail?\u201d said James impatiently. \u201cYou run round with a werewolf once a month \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d implored Lupin.\n\nHarry looked anxiously behind him again. Snape remained close by, still buried in his examination questions; but this was Snape\u2019s memory, and Harry was sure that if Snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds, he, Harry, would not be able to follow James any farther. To his intense relief, however, when James and his three friends strode off down the lawn toward the lake, Snape followed, still poring over the paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going. By jogging a little ahead of him, Harry managed to maintain a close watch on James and the others.\n\n\u201cWell, I thought that paper was a piece of cake,\u201d he heard Sirius say. \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if I don\u2019t get Outstanding on it at least.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d said James. He put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling Golden Snitch.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNicked it,\u201d said James casually. He started playing with the Snitch, allowing it to fly as much as a foot away and seizing it again; his reflexes were excellent. Wormtail watched him in awe.\n\nThey stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where Harry, Ron, and Hermione had spent a Sunday finishing their homework, and threw themselves down on the grass.\n\nHarry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw, to his delight, that Snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadows of a clump of bushes. He was as deeply immersed in the O.W.L. paper as ever, which left Harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree.\n\nThe sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake, on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the Great Hall were sitting with shoes and socks off, cooling their feet in the water.\n\nLupin had pulled out a book and was reading. Sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass, looking rather haughty and bored, but very handsomely so. James was still playing with the Snitch, letting it zoom farther and farther away, almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second. Wormtail was watching him with his mouth open. Every time James made a particularly difficult catch, Wormtail gasped and applauded. After five minutes of this, Harry wondered why James didn\u2019t tell Wormtail to get a grip on himself, but James seemed to be enjoying the attention. Harry noticed his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to make sure it did not get too tidy, and also that he kept looking over at the girls by the water\u2019s edge.\n\n\u201cPut that away, will you?\u201d said Sirius finally, as James made a fine catch and Wormtail let out a cheer. \u201cBefore Wormtail wets himself from excitement.\u201d\n\nWormtail turned slightly pink but James grinned.\n\n\u201cIf it bothers you,\u201d he said, stuffing the Snitch back in his pocket. Harry had the distinct impression that Sirius was the only one for whom James would have stopped showing off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cWish it was full moon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might,\u201d said Lupin darkly from behind his book. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got Transfiguration, if you\u2019re bored you could test me . . . Here.\u201d He held out his book.\n\nSirius snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t need to look at that rubbish, I know it all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis\u2019ll liven you up, Padfoot,\u201d said James quietly. \u201cLook who it is . . .\u201d\n\nSirius\u2019s head turned. He had become very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSnivellus.\u201d\n\nHarry turned to see what Sirius was looking at.\n\nSnape was on his feet again, and was stowing the O.W.L. paper in his bag. As he emerged from the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass, Sirius and James stood up. Lupin and Wormtail remained sitting: Lupin was still staring down at his book, though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows. Wormtail was looking from Sirius and James to Snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face.\n\n\u201cAll right, Snivellus?\u201d said James loudly.\n\nSnape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack: Dropping his bag, he plunged his hand inside his robes, and his wand was halfway into the air when James shouted, \u201cExpelliarmus!\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him. Sirius let out a bark of laughter.\n\n\u201cImpedimenta!\u201d he said, pointing his wand at Snape, who was knocked off his feet, halfway through a dive toward his own fallen wand.\n\nStudents all around had turned to watch. Some of them had gotten to their feet and were edging nearer to watch. Some looked apprehensive, others entertained.\n\nSnape lay panting on the ground. James and Sirius advanced on him, wands up, James glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the water\u2019s edge as he went. Wormtail was on his feet now, watching hungrily, edging around Lupin to get a clearer view.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d the exam go, Snivelly?\u201d said James.\n\n\u201cI was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment,\u201d said Sirius viciously. \u201cThere\u2019ll be great grease marks all over it, they won\u2019t be able to read a word.\u201d\n\nSeveral people watching laughed; Snape was clearly unpopular. Wormtail sniggered shrilly. Snape was trying to get up, but the jinx was still operating on him; he was struggling, as though bound by invisible ropes.\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 wait,\u201d he panted, staring up at James with an expression of purest loathing. \u201cYou \u2014 wait . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWait for what?\u201d said Sirius coolly. \u201cWhat\u2019re you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?\u201d\n\nSnape let out a stream of mixed swearwords and hexes, but his wand being ten feet away nothing happened.\n\n\u201cWash out your mouth,\u201d said James coldly. \u201cScourgify!\u201d\n\nPink soap bubbles streamed from Snape\u2019s mouth at once; the froth was covering his lips, making him gag, choking him \u2014\n\n\u201cLeave him ALONE!\u201d\n\nJames and Sirius looked around. James\u2019s free hand jumped to his hair again.\n\nIt was one of the girls from the lake edge. She had thick, dark red hair that fell to her shoulders and startlingly green almond-shaped eyes \u2014 Harry\u2019s eyes.\n\nHarry\u2019s mother . . .\n\n\u201cAll right, Evans?\u201d said James, and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature.\n\n\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Lily repeated. She was looking at James with every sign of great dislike. \u201cWhat\u2019s he done to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said James, appearing to deliberate the point, \u201cit\u2019s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean . . .\u201d\n\nMany of the surrounding watchers laughed, Sirius and Wormtail included, but Lupin, still apparently intent on his book, didn\u2019t, and neither did Lily.\n\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re funny,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cBut you\u2019re just an arrogant, bullying toerag, Potter. Leave him alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will if you go out with me, Evans,\u201d said James quickly. \u201cGo on . . . Go out with me, and I\u2019ll never lay a wand on old Snivelly again.\u201d\n\nBehind him, the Impediment Jinx was wearing off. Snape was beginning to inch toward his fallen wand, spitting out soapsuds as he crawled.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid,\u201d said Lily.\n\n\u201cBad luck, Prongs,\u201d said Sirius briskly, turning back to Snape. \u201cOY!\u201d\n\nBut too late; Snape had directed his wand straight at James; there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of James\u2019s face, spattering his robes with blood. James whirled about; a second flash of light later, Snape was hanging upside down in the air, his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants.\n\nMany people in the small crowd watching cheered. Sirius, James, and Wormtail roared with laughter.\n\nLily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile, said, \u201cLet him down!\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said James and he jerked his wand upward. Snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground. Disentangling himself from his robes, he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but Sirius said, \u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d and Snape keeled over again at once, rigid as a board.\n\n\u201cLEAVE HIM ALONE!\u201d Lily shouted. She had her own wand out now. James and Sirius eyed it warily.\n\n\u201cAh, Evans, don\u2019t make me hex you,\u201d said James earnestly.\n\n\u201cTake the curse off him, then!\u201d\n\nJames sighed deeply, then turned to Snape and muttered the countercurse.\n\n\u201cThere you go,\u201d he said, as Snape struggled to his feet again, \u201cyou\u2019re lucky Evans was here, Snivellus \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need help from filthy little Mudbloods like her!\u201d\n\nLily blinked. \u201cFine,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cI won\u2019t bother in future. And I\u2019d wash your pants if I were you, Snivellus.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologize to Evans!\u201d James roared at Snape, his wand pointed threateningly at him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to make him apologize,\u201d Lily shouted, rounding on James. \u201cYou\u2019re as bad as he is . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d yelped James. \u201cI\u2019d NEVER call you a \u2014 you-know-what!\u201d\n\n\u201cMessing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you\u2019ve just got off your broomstick, showing off with that stupid Snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can \u2014 I\u2019m surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it. You make me SICK.\u201d\n\nShe turned on her heel and hurried away.\n\n\u201cEvans!\u201d James shouted after her, \u201cHey, EVANS!\u201d\n\nBut she didn\u2019t look back.\n\n\u201cWhat is it with her?\u201d said James, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him.\n\n\u201cReading between the lines, I\u2019d say she thinks you\u2019re a bit conceited, mate,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said James, who looked furious now, \u201cright \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside down in the air.\n\n\u201cWho wants to see me take off Snivelly\u2019s pants?\u201d\n\nBut whether James really did take off Snape\u2019s pants, Harry never found out. A hand had closed tight over his upper arm, closed with a pincerlike grip. Wincing, Harry looked around to see who had hold of him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized Snape standing right beside him, white with rage.\n\n\u201cHaving fun?\u201d\n\nHarry felt himself rising into the air. The summer\u2019s day evaporated around him, he was floating upward through icy blackness, Snape\u2019s hand still tight upon his upper arm. Then, with a swooping feeling as though he had turned head over heels in midair, his feet hit the stone floor of Snape\u2019s dungeon, and he was standing again beside the Pensieve on Snape\u2019s desk in the shadowy, present-day Potions master\u2019s study.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Snape, gripping Harry\u2019s arm so tightly Harry\u2019s hand was starting to feel numb. \u201cSo . . . been enjoying yourself, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cN-no . . .\u201d said Harry, trying to free his arm.\n\nIt was scary: Snape\u2019s lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth were bared.\n\n\u201cAmusing man, your father, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d said Snape, shaking Harry so hard that his glasses slipped down his nose.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 didn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape threw Harry from him with all his might. Harry fell hard onto the dungeon floor.\n\n\u201cYou will not tell anybody what you saw!\u201d Snape bellowed.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could. \u201cNo, of course I w \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out, get out, I don\u2019t want to see you in this office ever again!\u201d\n\nAnd as Harry hurtled toward the door, a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head. He wrenched the door open and flew away up the corridor, stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and Snape. There he leaned against the wall, panting, and rubbing his bruised arm.\n\nHe had no desire at all to return to Gryffindor Tower so early, nor to tell Ron and Hermione what he had just seen. What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him \u2014 it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter29": "CAREER ADVICE\n\n\n\n\nBut why haven\u2019t you got Occlumency lessons anymore?\u201d said Hermione, frowning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cSnape reckons I can carry on by myself now I\u2019ve got the basics . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve stopped having funny dreams?\u201d said Hermione skeptically.\n\n\u201cPretty much,\u201d said Harry, not looking at her.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think Snape should stop until you\u2019re absolutely sure you can control them!\u201d said Hermione indignantly. \u201cHarry, I think you should go back to him and ask \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry forcefully. \u201cJust drop it, Hermione, okay?\u201d\n\nIt was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedules for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it \u2014 it was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.\n\nRon had been startled to discover that there were only six weeks left until their exams.\n\n\u201cHow can that come as a shock?\u201d Hermione demanded, as she tapped each little square on Ron\u2019s schedule with her wand so that it flashed a different color according to its subject.\n\n\u201cI dunno . . .\u201d said Ron, \u201cthere\u2019s been a lot going on . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there you are,\u201d she said, handing him his schedule, \u201cif you follow that you should do fine.\u201d\n\nRon looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given me an evening off every week!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for Quidditch practice,\u201d said Hermione.\n\nThe smile faded from Ron\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad\u2019s got of becoming Minister of Magic . . .\u201d\n\nHermione said nothing. She was looking at Harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said quickly. \u201cNothing . . .\u201d\n\nHe seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermione\u2019s chair.\n\n\u201cI saw Cho earlier,\u201d said Hermione tentatively, \u201cand she looked really miserable too. . . . Have you two had a row again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWha \u2014 oh yeah, we have,\u201d said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse.\n\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sneak friend of hers, Marietta,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t blame you!\u201d said Ron angrily, setting down his study schedule. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for her . . .\u201d\n\nRon went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found helpful. All he had to do was look angry, nod, and say \u201cyeah\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s right\u201d whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.\n\nHe felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. He had been so sure that his parents had been wonderful people that he never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving Snape\u2019s aspersions on his father\u2019s character. Hadn\u2019t people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry\u2019s head. . . . He was as bad, wasn\u2019t he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside down for the fun of it . . . not unless they really loathed them . . . Perhaps Malfoy, or somebody who really deserved it . . .\n\nHarry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James\u2019s hands \u2014 but hadn\u2019t Lily asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s he done to you?\u201d And hadn\u2019t James replied, \u201cIt\u2019s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean?\u201d Hadn\u2019t James started it all simply because Sirius said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius. . . . But in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen. . . .\n\nHarry reminded himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been decent, yet the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else. She had clearly loathed James and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it. . . .\n\nFor nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James he had glowed with pride inside. And now . . . now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him.\n\nThe weather grew breezier, brighter, and warmer as the holidays passed, but Harry was stuck with the rest of the fifth and seventh years, who were all trapped inside, traipsing back and forth to the library. Harry pretended that his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, his excuse went unchallenged.\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m talking to you, can you hear me?\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\nHe looked around. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was late on Sunday evening; Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to review Ancient Runes; Ron had Quidditch practice.\n\n\u201cOh hi,\u201d said Harry, pulling his books back toward him. \u201cHow come you\u2019re not at practice?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cRon had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat.\u201d She sighed heavily. \u201cAnyway . . . a package just arrived, it\u2019s only just got through Umbridge\u2019s new screening process . . .\u201d\n\nShe hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped, and there was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading INSPECTED AND PASSED BY THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Easter eggs from Mum,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cThere\u2019s one for you. . . . There you go . . .\u201d\n\nShe handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of Fizzing Whizbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a hard lump rise in his throat.\n\n\u201cAre you okay, Harry?\u201d asked Ginny quietly.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this.\n\n\u201cYou seem really down lately,\u201d Ginny persisted. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure if you just talked to Cho . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Cho I want to talk to,\u201d said Harry brusquely.\n\n\u201cWho is it, then?\u201d asked Ginny.\n\n\u201cI . . .\u201d\n\nHe glanced around to make quite sure that nobody was listening; Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile of books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.\n\n\u201cI wish I could talk to Sirius,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut I know I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMore to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit, and put it into his mouth.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg too, \u201cif you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Harry hopelessly. \u201cWith Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing about growing up with Fred and George,\u201d said Ginny thoughtfully, \u201cis that you sort of start thinking anything\u2019s possible if you\u2019ve got enough nerve.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate \u2014 Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementors \u2014 or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful. . . .\n\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh damn,\u201d whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. \u201cI forgot \u2014\u201d\n\nMadam Pince was swooping down upon them, her shriveled face contorted with rage.\n\n\u201cChocolate in the library!\u201d she screamed. \u201cOut \u2014 out \u2014 OUT!\u201d\n\nAnd whipping out her wand, she caused Harry\u2019s books, bag, and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran.\n\n\nAs though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets, and notices concerning various Wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the board, which read:\n\nCAREER ADVICE\n\nAll fifth years will be required to attend a short meeting with their Head of House during the first week of the Summer term, in which they will be given the opportunity to discuss their future careers. Times of individual appointments are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall\u2019s office at half-past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the career information that had been left there for their perusal.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t fancy Healing,\u201d said Ron on the last evening of the holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St. Mungo\u2019s on its front. \u201cIt says here you need at least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey. . . . Don\u2019t want much, do they?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a very responsible job, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hermione absently. She was poring over a bright pink-and-orange leaflet that was headed SO YOU THINK YOU\u2019D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS? \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles. . . . All they want is an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies . . . \u2018Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience, and a good sense of fun!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,\u201d said Harry darkly. \u201cGood sense of when to duck, more like . . .\u201d He was halfway through a pamphlet on Wizard banking. \u201cListen to this:\n\n\u201c\u2018Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure, and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad . . . \u2019 They want Arithmancy, though. . . . You could do it, Hermione!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t much fancy banking,\u201d said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d said a voice in Harry\u2019s ear. He looked around; Fred and George had come to join them. \u201cGinny\u2019s had a word with us about you,\u201d said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off onto the floor. \u201cShe says you need to talk to Sirius?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway toward picking up MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES.\n\n\u201cYeah . . .\u201d said Harry, trying to sound casual, \u201cyeah, I thought I\u2019d like \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so ridiculous,\u201d said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. \u201cWith Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we think we can find a way around that,\u201d said George, stretching and smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?\u201d continued Fred. \u201cNo point at all, we answered ourselves. And of course, we\u2019d have messed up people\u2019s studying too, which would be the very last thing we\u2019d want to do.\u201d\n\nHe gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s business as usual from tomorrow,\u201d Fred continued briskly. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but still,\u201d said Hermione with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, \u201ceven if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cUmbridge\u2019s office,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\nHe had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no alternative; Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own.\n\n\u201cAre \u2014 you \u2014 insane?\u201d said Hermione in a hushed voice.\n\nRon had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade and was watching the conversation warily.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry, shrugging.\n\n\u201cAnd how are you going to get in there in the first place?\u201d\n\nHarry was ready for this question.\n\n\u201cSirius\u2019s knife,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cChristmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that\u2019ll open any lock,\u201d said Harry. \u201cSo even if she\u2019s bewitched the door so Alohomora won\u2019t work, which I bet she has \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think about this?\u201d Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs. Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry\u2019s first dinner in Grimmauld Place.\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion. \u201cIf Harry wants to do it, it\u2019s up to him, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSpoken like a true friend and Weasley,\u201d said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back. \u201cRight, then. We\u2019re thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact if everybody\u2019s in the corridors \u2014 Harry, we\u2019ll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office \u2014 I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?\u201d he said, looking at George.\n\n\u201cEasy,\u201d said George.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of diversion is it?\u201d asked Ron.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see, little bro,\u201d said Fred, as he and George got up again. \u201cAt least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy\u2019s corridor round about five o\u2019clock tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nHarry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge\u2019s office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough \u2014 today also happened to be the first time he would be in close proximity with Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office, as they had Potions that day.\n\nAfter lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville\u2019s bed, staring out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius\u2019s own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his father\u2019s behavior. . . .\n\nSomething caught Harry\u2019s attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire. . . .\n\nHarry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk, and started to dress.\n\nWith the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge\u2019s office ahead, Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione\u2019s almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o\u2019clock. For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.\n\n\u201c. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she\u2019ll be able to guess you\u2019ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she\u2019ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d said Ron in a low and indignant voice, \u201care you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take notes instead?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou take notes for a change, it won\u2019t kill you!\u201d\n\nBy the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione any longer. Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.\n\nSnape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernon\u2019s favorites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it, and took it up to Snape\u2019s desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an E.\n\nHe had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise; Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around again. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor, and Snape was watching him with a look of gloating pleasure.\n\n\u201cWhoops,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnother zero, then, Potter . . .\u201d\n\nHarry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d said Hermione with her hands over her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Harry, I thought you\u2019d finished, so I cleared up!\u201d\n\nHarry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him about using Umbridge\u2019s office again.\n\nHe was in such a bad mood by the time that he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his career appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering only when Ron asked him why he wasn\u2019t in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late.\n\n\u201cSorry, Professor,\u201d he panted, as he closed the door. \u201cI forgot . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter, Potter,\u201d she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked around.\n\nProfessor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck, and a small, horribly smug smile on her face.\n\n\u201cSit down, Potter,\u201d said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.\n\nHarry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.\n\n\u201cWell, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into sixth and seventh years,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cHave you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr,\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d need top grades for that,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. \u201cThey ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing under \u2018Exceeds Expectations\u2019 grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It\u2019s a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the best. In fact, I don\u2019t think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.\u201d\n\nAt this moment Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?\u201d she went on, talking a little more loudly than before.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDefense Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cNaturally,\u201d said Professor McGonagall crisply. \u201cI would also advise \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.\n\n\u201cI would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T. classes unless they have achieved \u2018Exceeds Expectations\u2019 or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I\u2019d say you\u2019re averaging \u2018Acceptable\u2019 at the moment, so you\u2019ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,\u201d she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. \u201cPoisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than \u2018Outstanding\u2019 in their O.W.L.s, so \u2014\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.\n\n\u201cMay I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?\u201d Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.\n\n\u201cOh no, thank you very much,\u201d said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. \u201cI just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?\u201d\n\n\u201cI daresay you\u2019ll find you can,\u201d said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cI was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?\u201d said Professor Umbridge sweetly.\n\n\u201cWere you?\u201d said Professor McGonagall haughtily. \u201cWell, Potter,\u201d she continued, as though there had been no interruption, \u201cif you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between \u2018Acceptable\u2019 and \u2018Exceeds Expectations\u2019 for the last two years, so your Charm work seems satisfactory; as for Defense Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you \u2014 are you quite sure you wouldn\u2019t like a cough drop, Dolores?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no need, thank you, Minerva,\u201d simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. \u201cI was just concerned that you might not have Harry\u2019s most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I\u2019m quite sure I slipped in a note . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, this thing?\u201d said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry\u2019s folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment.\n\n\u201cYes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you not understand my note, Minerva?\u201d asked Professor Umbridge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.\n\n\u201cOf course I understood it,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly that the words came out a little muffled.\n\n\u201cWell, then, I am confused. . . . I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t quite understand how you can give Mr. Potter false hope that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFalse hope?\u201d repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge. \u201cHe has achieved high marks in all his Defense Against the Dark Arts tests \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI should have made my meaning plainer,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. \u201cHe has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.\u201d\n\nProfessor Umbridge\u2019s smile vanished as suddenly as a lightbulb blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard, and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.\n\n\u201cAny questions, Potter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWhat sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough N.E.W.T.s?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, \u201cperseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical defense. It will mean a lot more study even after you\u2019ve left school, so unless you\u2019re prepared to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll also find,\u201d said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, \u201cthat the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 unless you\u2019re prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.\u201d\n\n\u201cA very good chance, then,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cPotter has a criminal record,\u201d said Umbridge loudly.\n\n\u201cPotter has been cleared of all charges,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, even more loudly.\n\nProfessor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanor had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.\n\n\u201cPotter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall got to her feet too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move. She towered over Professor Umbridge.\n\n\u201cPotter,\u201d she said in ringing tones, \u201cI will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly I will make sure you achieve the required results!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Magic will never employ Harry Potter!\u201d said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.\n\n\u201cThere may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!\u201d shouted Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby finger at McGonagall. \u201cYes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think you\u2019ll be where I am, don\u2019t you, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are raving,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. \u201cPotter, that concludes our career consultation.\u201d\n\nHarry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor.\n\nProfessor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019ve thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,\u201d Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to chapter thirty-four (\u201cNon-Retaliation and Negotiation\u201d). \u201cUmbridge looks like she\u2019s in a really bad mood already . . .\u201d\n\nEvery now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking. . . .\n\nHe could just imagine Professor McGonagall\u2019s reaction if he were caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge\u2019s office mere hours after she had vouched for him. . . . There was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that sometime during the next summer holiday he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve. . . . Nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach. . . . And then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father\u2019s old Invisibility Cloak. . . .\n\nBut the fact remained that if he were caught . . .\n\n\u201cDumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!\u201d whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from Umbridge. \u201cAnd if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!\u201d\n\nHe could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer\u2019s day more than twenty years ago. . . .\n\nAnd then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room . . . \u201cYou\u2019re less like your father than I thought. . . . The risk would\u2019ve been what made it fun for James . . .\u201d\n\nBut did he want to be like his father anymore?\n\n\u201cHarry, don\u2019t do it, please don\u2019t do it!\u201d Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.\n\nHe did not answer; he did not know what to do. Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice. He would not look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, \u201cGive it a rest, okay? He can make up his own mind.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them. People exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully \u2014\n\nThen Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: It was now or never.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 please!\u201d said Hermione weakly.\n\nBut he had made up his mind \u2014 hitching his bag more securely onto his shoulder he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction, off to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing. . . .\n\nHarry reached the corridor where Umbridge\u2019s office was situated and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armor whose helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius\u2019s knife, and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge\u2019s door.\n\nHe inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him, and looked around.\n\nIt was empty; nothing was moving except the horrible kittens on the plates continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated broomsticks.\n\nHarry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.\n\nHe crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking. He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it onto the logs stacked neatly beneath him. They exploded at once into emerald-green flames.\n\n\u201cNumber twelve, Grimmauld Place!\u201d Harry said loudly and clearly.\n\nIt was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced; he had traveled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of Wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country: This time, his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of Umbridge\u2019s office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire. . . .\n\nAnd then, abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling rather sick and as though he was wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment.\n\n\u201cSirius?\u201d\n\nThe man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, but Lupin.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d he said, looking thoroughly shocked. \u201cWhat are you \u2014 what\u2019s happened, is everything all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI just wondered \u2014 I mean, I just fancied a \u2014 a chat with Sirius.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed. \u201cHe went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again . . .\u201d\n\nAnd Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire \u2014 his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridge\u2019s hard stone floor.\n\nLupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level; Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned. \u201cAre you all right? Do you need help?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cit\u2019s nothing like that. . . . I just wanted to talk . . . about my dad . . .\u201d\n\nThey exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the second, and he guessed that five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion \u2014 George had only guaranteed him twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve.\n\nWhen he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment. Then Lupin said quietly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fifteen!\u201d said Harry heatedly.\n\n\u201cLook, Harry,\u201d said Sirius placatingly, \u201cJames and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can\u2019t you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be \u2014 he was popular, he was good at Quidditch, good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and James \u2014 whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry \u2014 always hated the Dark Arts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because \u2014 well, just because you said you were bored,\u201d he finished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud of it,\u201d said Sirius quickly.\n\nLupin looked sideways at Sirius and then said, \u201cLook, Harry, what you\u2019ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did \u2014 everyone thought they were the height of cool \u2014 if they sometimes got a bit carried away \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,\u201d said Sirius.\n\nLupin smiled.\n\n\u201cHe kept messing up his hair,\u201d said Harry in a pained voice.\n\nSirius and Lupin laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten he used to do that,\u201d said Sirius affectionately.\n\n\u201cWas he playing with the Snitch?\u201d said Lupin eagerly.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently. \u201cWell . . . I thought he was a bit of an idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he was a bit of an idiot!\u201d said Sirius bracingly. \u201cWe were all idiots! Well \u2014 not Moony so much,\u201d he said fairly, looking at Lupin, but Lupin shook his head.\n\n\u201cDid I ever tell you to lay off Snape?\u201d he said. \u201cDid I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cyou made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes. . . . That was something . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, \u201che kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,\u201d said Sirius, shrugging. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t stop himself showing off whenever he got near her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come she married him?\u201d Harry asked miserably. \u201cShe hated him!\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, she didn\u2019t,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cShe started going out with him in seventh year,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cOnce James had deflated his head a bit,\u201d said Sirius.\n\n\u201cAnd stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,\u201d said Lupin.\n\n\u201cEven Snape?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Lupin slowly, \u201cSnape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn\u2019t really expect James to take that lying down, could you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd my mum was okay with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t know too much about it, to tell you the truth,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cI mean, James didn\u2019t take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he?\u201d\n\nSirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cyour father was the best friend I ever had, and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d said Harry heavily. \u201cI just never thought I\u2019d feel sorry for Snape.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you mention it,\u201d said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, \u201chow did Snape react when he found you\u2019d seen all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told me he\u2019d never teach me Occlumency again,\u201d said Harry indifferently, \u201clike that\u2019s a big disappoint \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe WHAT?\u201d shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes.\n\n\u201cAre you serious, Harry?\u201d said Lupin quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s stopped giving you lessons?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great overreaction. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s a bit of a relief to tell you the \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming up there to have a word with Snape!\u201d said Sirius forcefully and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back down again.\n\n\u201cIf anyone\u2019s going to tell Snape it will be me!\u201d he said firmly. \u201cBut Harry, first of all, you\u2019re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons \u2014 when Dumbledore hears \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell him that, he\u2019d kill me!\u201d said Harry, outraged. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see him when we got out of the Pensieve \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!\u201d said Lupin sternly. \u201cDo you understand me? Nothing!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed. \u201cI\u2019ll . . . I\u2019ll try and say something to him. . . . But it won\u2019t be . . .\u201d\n\nHe fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps.\n\n\u201cIs that Kreacher coming downstairs?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Sirius, glancing behind him. \u201cIt must be somebody your end . . .\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart skipped several beats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d better go!\u201d he said hastily and he pulled his head backward out of Grimmauld Place\u2019s fire. For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders, and then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge\u2019s fire with his head firmly back on, watching the emerald flames flicker and die.\n\n\u201cQuickly, quickly!\u201d he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. \u201cAh, she\u2019s left it open . . .\u201d\n\nHarry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge\u2019s desk, and began rifling through the papers inside it.\n\n\u201cApproval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it at last. . . . They\u2019ve had it coming to them for years . . .\u201d\n\nHe pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.\n\nHarry leapt to his feet and, making sure that he had his bag and the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.\n\nOne landing down from Umbridge\u2019s office and Harry thought it was safe to become visible again; he pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onward. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the entrance hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there.\n\nIt was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down upon Fred and George, who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered.\n\n\u201cSo!\u201d said Umbridge triumphantly, whom Harry realized was standing just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey. \u201cSo . . . you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty amusing, yeah,\u201d said Fred, looking back up at her without the slightest sign of fear.\n\nFilch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the form, Headmistress,\u201d he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. \u201cI\u2019ve got the form and I\u2019ve got the whips waiting. . . . Oh, let me do it now . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good, Argus,\u201d she said. \u201cYou two,\u201d she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, \u201care about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d said Fred. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are.\u201d\n\nHe turned to his twin.\n\n\u201cGeorge,\u201d said Fred, \u201cI think we\u2019ve outgrown full-time education.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been feeling that way myself,\u201d said George lightly.\n\n\u201cTime to test our talents in the real world, d\u2019you reckon?\u201d asked Fred.\n\n\u201cDefinitely,\u201d said George.\n\nAnd before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together, \u201cAccio Brooms!\u201d\n\nHarry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left he ducked just in time \u2014 Fred and George\u2019s broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor toward their owners. They turned left, streaked down the stairs, and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be seeing you,\u201d Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.\n\n\u201cYeah, don\u2019t bother to keep in touch,\u201d said George, mounting his own.\n\nFred looked around at the assembled students, and at the silent, watchful crowd.\n\n\u201cIf anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley \u2014 Weasleys\u2019 Wizard Wheezes,\u201d he said in a loud voice. \u201cOur new premises!\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecial discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they\u2019re going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,\u201d added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.\n\n\u201cSTOP THEM!\u201d shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.\n\n\u201cGive her hell from us, Peeves.\u201d\n\nAnd Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter30": "GRAWP\n\n\n\n\nThe story of Fred and George\u2019s flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwarts legend. Within a week, even those who had been eyewitnesses were half-convinced that they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms, pelting her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them, so that Harry frequently heard students saying things like, \u201cHonestly, some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place,\u201d or else, \u201cOne more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley . . .\u201d\n\nFred and George had made sure that nobody was likely to forget them very soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success. Eventually the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George\u2019s Wildfire Whiz-Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.\n\nThen there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge\u2019s office door, through which Fred and George\u2019s Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry\u2019s Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumored, Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were far from over.\n\nInspired by Fred and George\u2019s example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy-snouted niffler into Umbridge\u2019s office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge on her reentrance, and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs and Stinkpellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh clean air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.\n\nFilch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were now so many of them that he did not know which way to turn. The Inquisitorial Squad were attempting to help him, but odd things kept happening to its members. Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes. Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione\u2019s delight, missed all her lessons the following day, as she had sprouted antlers.\n\nMeanwhile it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers, or else spout blood from both nostrils. Shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering \u201cUmbridge-itis.\u201d After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating, and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves.\n\nBut not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred\u2019s parting words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, he soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, and toppling statues and vases. Twice he shut Mrs. Norris inside suits of armor, from which she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. He smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows, flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.\n\nNone of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her. Indeed, a week after Fred and George\u2019s departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, \u201cIt unscrews the other way.\u201d\n\nTo cap matters, Montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet. He remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one Tuesday morning striding up the front drive, looking extremely angry.\n\n\u201cShould we say something?\u201d said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr. and Mrs. Montague marching inside. \u201cAbout what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course not, he\u2019ll recover,\u201d said Ron indifferently.\n\n\u201cAnyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Harry in a satisfied voice.\n\nHe and Ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands. Harry\u2019s spouted four very short legs that would not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair. Ron\u2019s grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty, trembled for a few seconds, then folded, causing the cup to crack into two.\n\n\u201cReparo!\u201d said Hermione quickly, mending Ron\u2019s cup with a wave of her wand. \u201cThat\u2019s all very well, but what if Montague\u2019s permanently injured?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d said Ron irritably, while his teacup stood drunkenly again, trembling violently at the knees. \u201cMontague shouldn\u2019t have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d she said, catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willow-patterned legs and replacing it in front of her. \u201cWhy should I be worried about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Mum\u2019s next letter finally gets through Umbridge\u2019s screening process,\u201d said Ron bitterly, now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight, \u201cI\u2019m going to be in deep trouble. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s sent a Howler again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait,\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cShe\u2019ll say I should\u2019ve stopped them leaving, I should\u2019ve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something. . . . Yeah, it\u2019ll be all my fault . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if she does say that it\u2019ll be very unfair, you couldn\u2019t have done anything! But I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t, I mean, if it\u2019s really true they\u2019ve got premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for ages . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s another thing, how did they get premises?\u201d said Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit dodgy, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019ll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley, she\u2019ll want to know what they\u2019ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, that occurred to me too,\u201d said Hermione, allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry\u2019s, whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry curtly.\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d said Ron and Hermione together.\n\n\u201cBecause \u2014\u201d Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals. \u201cBecause they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June.\u201d\n\nThere was a shocked silence, then Hermione\u2019s teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor.\n\n\u201cOh, Harry, you didn\u2019t!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYes, I did,\u201d said Harry mutinously. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t regret it either \u2014 I didn\u2019t need the gold, and they\u2019ll be great at a joke shop . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is excellent!\u201d said Ron, looking thrilled. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault, Harry \u2014 Mum can\u2019t blame me at all! Can I tell her?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I suppose you\u2019d better,\u201d said Harry dully. \u201c\u2019Specially if she thinks they\u2019re receiving stolen cauldrons or something . . .\u201d\n\nHermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson, but Harry had a shrewd suspicion that her self-restraint was bound to crack before long. Sure enough, once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak May sunshine, she fixed Harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air.\n\nHarry interrupted her before she had even started.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good nagging me, it\u2019s done,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cFred and George have got the gold \u2014 spent a good bit of it too, by the sounds of it \u2014 and I can\u2019t get it back from them and I don\u2019t want to. So save your breath, Hermione.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything about Fred and George!\u201d she said in an injured voice.\n\nRon snorted disbelievingly and Hermione threw him a very dirty look.\n\n\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t!\u201d she said angrily. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I was going to ask Harry when he\u2019s going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlumency lessons again!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George\u2019s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of things to tell them. He had ended up saying to them truthfully that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. He had been regretting this ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve stopped having funny dreams,\u201d Hermione said now, \u201cbecause Ron told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again . . .\u201d\n\nHarry threw Ron a furious look. Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself.\n\n\u201cYou were only muttering a bit,\u201d he mumbled apologetically. \u201cSomething about \u2018just a bit farther.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch,\u201d Harry lied brutally. \u201cI was trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the Quaffle.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s ears went red. Harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure: He had not, of course, dreamed anything of the sort.\n\nLast night he had once again made the journey along the Department of Mysteries corridor. He had passed through the circular room, then the room full of clicking and dancing light, until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres. . . .\n\nHe had hurried straight toward row number ninety-seven, turned left, and ran along it. . . . It had probably been then that he had spoken aloud. . . . Just a bit farther . . . for he could feel his conscious self struggling to wake . . . and before he had reached the end of the row, he had found himself lying in bed again, gazing up at the canopy of his four-poster.\n\n\u201cYou are trying to block your mind, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Hermione, looking beadily at Harry. \u201cYou are keeping going with your Occlumency?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye. The truth was that he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue.\n\nThe problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to studying, his mind seemed saturated with information when he went to bed so that he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all. When he did, his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams. He also suspected that part of his mind \u2014 the part that often spoke in Hermione\u2019s voice \u2014 now felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door, and sought to wake him before he could reach journey\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Ron, whose ears were still flaming red, \u201cif Montague doesn\u2019t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff, we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I s\u2019pose so,\u201d said Harry, glad of a change of subject.\n\n\u201cI mean, we\u2019ve won one, lost one \u2014 if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Harry, losing track of what he was agreeing to: Cho Chang had just walked across the courtyard, determinedly not looking at him.\n\n\nThe final match of the Quidditch season, Gryffindor versus Ravenclaw, was to take place on the last weekend of May. Although Slytherin had been narrowly defeated by Hufflepuff in their last match, Gryffindor was not daring to hope for victory, due mainly (though of course nobody said it to him) to Ron\u2019s abysmal goalkeeping record. He, however, seemed to have found a new optimism.\n\n\u201cI mean, I can\u2019t get any worse, can I?\u201d he told Harry and Hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match. \u201cNothing to lose now, is there?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Hermione, as she and Harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd, \u201cI think Ron might do better without Fred and George around. They never exactly gave him a lot of confidence . . .\u201d\n\nLuna Lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head.\n\n\u201cOh gosh, I forgot!\u201d said Hermione, watching the eagle flapping its wings as Luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing Slytherins. \u201cCho will be playing, won\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nHarry, who had not forgotten this, merely grunted.\n\nThey found seats in the second to topmost row of the stands. It was a fine, clear day. Ron could not wish for better, and Harry found himself hoping against hope that Ron would not give the Slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of \u201cWeasley Is Our King.\u201d\n\nLee Jordan, who had been very dispirited since Fred and George had left, was commentating as usual. As the teams zoomed out onto the pitches he named the players with something less than his usual gusto.\n\n\u201c. . . Bradley . . . Davies . . . Chang,\u201d he said, and Harry felt his stomach perform, less of a back flip, more a feeble lurch as Cho walked out onto the pitch, her shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze. He was not sure what he wanted to happen anymore, except that he could not stand any more rows. Even the sight of her chatting animatedly to Roger Davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re off!\u201d said Lee. \u201cAnd Davies takes the Quaffle immediately, Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle, he dodges Johnson, he dodges Bell, he dodges Spinnet as well. . . . He\u2019s going straight for goal! He\u2019s going to shoot \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014\u201d Lee swore very loudly. \u201cAnd he\u2019s scored.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione groaned with the rest of the Gryffindors. Predictably, horribly, the Slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing:\n\n\n\nWeasley cannot save a thing,\n\nHe cannot block a single ring . . .\n\n\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said a hoarse voice in Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cHermione . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked around and saw Hagrid\u2019s enormous bearded face sticking between the seats; apparently he had squeezed his way all along the row behind, for the first and second years he had just passed had a ruffled, flattened look about them. For some reason, Hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen, though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he whispered, \u201ccan yeh come with me? Now? While ev\u2019ryone\u2019s watchin\u2019 the match?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr . . . can\u2019t it wait, Hagrid?\u201d asked Harry. \u201cTill the match is over?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cNo, Harry, it\u2019s gotta be now . . . while ev\u2019ryone\u2019s lookin\u2019 the other way. . . . Please?\u201d\n\nHagrid\u2019s nose was gently dripping blood. His eyes were both blackened. Harry had not seen him this close up since his return to the school; he looked utterly woebegone.\n\n\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d said Harry at once, \u201c\u2019course we\u2019ll come . . .\u201d\n\nHe and Hermione edged back along their row of seats, causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them. The people in Hagrid\u2019s row were not complaining, merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible.\n\n\u201cI \u2019ppreciate this, you two, I really do,\u201d said Hagrid as they reached the stairs. He kept looking around nervously as they descended toward the lawn below. \u201cI jus\u2019 hope she doesn\u2019 notice us goin\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean Umbridge?\u201d said Harry. \u201cShe won\u2019t, she\u2019s got her whole Inquisitorial Squad sitting with her, didn\u2019t you see? She must be expecting trouble at the match.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, a bit o\u2019 trouble wouldn\u2019 hurt,\u201d said Hagrid, pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted. \u201cGive us more time . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Hagrid?\u201d said Hermione, looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the lawn toward the edge of the forest.\n\n\u201cYeh \u2014 yeh\u2019ll see in a mo\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid, looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them. \u201cHey \u2014 did someone jus\u2019 score?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be Ravenclaw,\u201d said Harry heavily.\n\n\u201cGood . . . good . . .\u201d said Hagrid distractedly. \u201cTha\u2019s good . . .\u201d\n\nThey had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn, looking around with every other step. When they reached his cabin, Hermione turned automatically left toward the front door; Hagrid, however, walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest, where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree. When he realized they were no longer with him, he turned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 in here,\u201d he said, jerking his shaggy head behind him.\n\n\u201cInto the forest?\u201d said Hermione, perplexed.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cC\u2019mon now, quick, before we\u2019re spotted!\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other, then ducked into the cover of the trees behind Hagrid, who was already striding away from them into the green gloom, his crossbow over his arm. Harry and Hermione ran to catch up with him.\n\n\u201cHagrid, why are you armed?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cJus\u2019 a precaution,\u201d said Hagrid, shrugging his massive shoulders.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals,\u201d said Hermione timidly.\n\n\u201cNah, well, we weren\u2019 goin\u2019 in so far then,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 anyway, tha\u2019 was before Firenze left the forest, wasn\u2019 it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does Firenze leaving make a difference?\u201d asked Hermione curiously.\n\n\u201c\u2019Cause the other centaurs are good an\u2019 riled at me, tha\u2019s why,\u201d said Hagrid quietly, glancing around. \u201cThey used ter be \u2014 well, yeh couldn\u2019 call \u2019em friendly \u2014 but we got on all righ\u2019. Kept \u2019emselves to \u2019emselves, bu\u2019 always turned up if I wanted a word. Not anymore . . .\u201d\n\nHe sighed deeply.\n\n\u201cFirenze said that they\u2019re angry because he went to work for Dumbledore?\u201d Harry asked, tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching Hagrid\u2019s profile.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Hagrid heavily. \u201cWell, angry doesn\u2019 cover it. Ruddy livid. If I hadn\u2019 stepped in, I reckon they\u2019d\u2019ve kicked Firenze ter death \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey attacked him?\u201d said Hermione, sounding shocked.\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Hagrid gruffly, forcing his way through several low-hanging branches. \u201cHe had half the herd onto him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you stopped it?\u201d said Harry, amazed and impressed. \u201cBy yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019Course I did, couldn\u2019t stand by an\u2019 watch \u2019em kill him, could I?\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cLucky I was passin\u2019, really . . . an\u2019 I\u2019d\u2019ve thought Firenze mighta remembered tha\u2019 before he started sendin\u2019 me stupid warnin\u2019s!\u201d he added hotly and unexpectedly.\n\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other, startled, but Hagrid, scowling, did not elaborate.\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d he said, breathing a little more heavily than usual, \u201csince then the other centaurs\u2019ve bin livid with me an\u2019 the trouble is, they\u2019ve got a lot of influence in the forest. . . . Cleverest creatures in here . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that why we\u2019re here, Hagrid?\u201d asked Hermione. \u201cThe centaurs?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh no,\u201d said Hagrid, shaking his head dismissively, \u201cno, it\u2019s not them. . . . Well, o\u2019 course, they could complicate the problem, yeah. . . . But yeh\u2019ll see what I mean in a bit . . .\u201d\n\nOn this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead, taking one stride for every three of theirs, so that they had great trouble keeping up with him.\n\nThe path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked farther and farther into the forest that it was as dark as dusk. They were soon a long way past the clearing where Hagrid had shown them the thestrals, but Harry felt no sense of unease until Hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees toward the dark heart of the forest.\n\n\u201cHagrid?\u201d said Harry, fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles over which Hagrid had stepped easily and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasions he had stepped off the forest path. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\n\u201cBit further,\u201d said Hagrid over his shoulder. \u201cC\u2019mon, Harry. . . . We need ter keep together now . . .\u201d\n\nIt was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as though they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione\u2019s robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves. Harry\u2019s arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches. They were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him. Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence. The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature \u2014 their absence struck him as rather ominous.\n\n\u201cHagrid, would it be all right if we lit our wands?\u201d said Hermione quietly.\n\n\u201cEr . . . all righ\u2019,\u201d Hagrid whispered back. \u201cIn fact . . .\u201d\n\nHe stopped suddenly and turned around; Hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backward. Harry caught her just before she hit the forest floor.\n\n\u201cMaybe we bes\u2019 jus\u2019 stop fer a momen\u2019, so I can . . . fill yeh in,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cBefore we ge\u2019 there, like.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said Hermione, as Harry set her back on her feet. They both murmured \u201cLumos!\u201d and their wand-tips ignited. Hagrid\u2019s face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and Harry saw that he looked nervous and sad again.\n\n\u201cRigh\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWell . . . see . . . the thing is . . .\u201d\n\nHe took a great breath.\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019m goin\u2019 ter be gettin\u2019 the sack any day now,\u201d he said.\n\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other, then back at him.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve lasted this long \u2014\u201d Hermione said tentatively. \u201cWhat makes you think \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cUmbridge reckons it was me that put tha\u2019 niffler in her office.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd was it?\u201d said Harry, before he could stop himself.\n\n\u201cNo, it ruddy well wasn\u2019!\u201d said Hagrid indignantly. \u201cOn\u2019y anythin\u2019 ter do with magical creatures an\u2019 she thinks it\u2019s got somethin\u2019 ter do with me. Yeh know she\u2019s bin lookin\u2019 fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back. I don\u2019 wan\u2019 ter go, o\u2019 course, but if it wasn\u2019 fer . . . well . . . the special circumstances I\u2019m abou\u2019 ter explain to yeh, I\u2019d leave righ\u2019 now, before she\u2019s go\u2019 the chance ter do it in front o\u2019 the whole school, like she did with Trelawney.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione both made noises of protest, but Hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end o\u2019 the world, I\u2019ll be able ter help Dumbledore once I\u2019m outta here, I can be useful ter the Order. An\u2019 you lot\u2019ll have Grubbly-Plank, yeh\u2019ll \u2014 yeh\u2019ll get through yer exams fine . . .\u201d His voice trembled and broke.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019 worry abou\u2019 me,\u201d he said hastily, as Hermione made to pat his arm. He pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it. \u201cLook, I wouldn\u2019 be tellin\u2019 yer this at all if I didn\u2019 have ter. See, if I go . . . well, I can\u2019 leave withou\u2019 . . . withou\u2019 tellin\u2019 someone . . . because I\u2019ll \u2014 I\u2019ll need you two ter help me. An\u2019 Ron, if he\u2019s willin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019ll help you,\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d\n\nHagrid gave a great sniff and patted Harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force that Harry was knocked sideways into a tree.\n\n\u201cI knew yeh\u2019d say yes,\u201d said Hagrid into his handkerchief, \u201cbut I won\u2019 . . . never . . . forget . . . Well . . . c\u2019mon . . . jus\u2019 a little bit further through here . . . Watch yerselves, now, there\u2019s nettles . . .\u201d\n\nThey walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes. Harry had opened his mouth to ask how much farther they had to go when Hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop.\n\n\u201cReally easy,\u201d he said softly. \u201cVery quiet, now . . .\u201d\n\nThey crept forward and Harry saw that they were facing a large, smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as Hagrid that he thought, with a jolt of dread, was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal. Trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound, so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade, behind which Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid now stood.\n\n\u201cSleepin\u2019,\u201d breathed Hagrid.\n\nSure enough, Harry could hear a distant, rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work. He glanced sideways at Hermione, who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open. She looked utterly terrified.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature, \u201cwho is he?\u201d\n\nHarry found this an odd question . . . \u201cWhat is it?\u201d was the one he had been planning on asking.\n\n\u201cHagrid, you told us,\u201d said Hermione, her wand now shaking in her hand, \u201cyou told us none of them wanted to come!\u201d\n\nHarry looked from her to Hagrid and then, as realization hit him, he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror.\n\nThe great mound of earth, on which he, Hermione, and Hagrid could easily have stood, was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep, grunting breathing. It was not a mound at all. It was the curved back of what was clearly . . .\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 no \u2014 he didn\u2019 want ter come,\u201d said Hagrid, sounding desperate. \u201cBut I had ter bring him, Hermione, I had ter!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d asked Hermione, who sounded as though she wanted to cry. \u201cWhy \u2014 what \u2014 oh, Hagrid!\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew if I jus\u2019 got him back,\u201d said Hagrid, sounding close to tears himself, \u201can\u2019 \u2014 an\u2019 taught him a few manners \u2014 I\u2019d be able ter take him outside an\u2019 show ev\u2019ryone he\u2019s harmless!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarmless!\u201d said Hermione shrilly, and Hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep. \u201cHe\u2019s been hurting you all this time, hasn\u2019t he? That\u2019s why you\u2019ve had all these injuries!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe don\u2019 know his own strength!\u201d said Hagrid earnestly. \u201cAn\u2019 he\u2019s gettin\u2019 better, he\u2019s not fightin\u2019 so much anymore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this is why it took you two months to get home!\u201d said Hermione distractedly. \u201cOh Hagrid, why did you bring him back if he didn\u2019t want to come, wouldn\u2019t he have been happier with his own people?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were all bullyin\u2019 him, Hermione, \u2019cause he\u2019s so small!\u201d said Hagrid.\n\n\u201cSmall?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cSmall?\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, I couldn\u2019 leave him,\u201d said Hagrid, tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard. \u201cSee \u2014 he\u2019s my brother!\u201d\n\nHermione simply stared at him, her mouth open.\n\n\u201cHagrid, when you say \u2018brother,\u2019\u201d said Harry slowly, \u201cdo you mean \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 half-brother,\u201d amended Hagrid. \u201cTurns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad, an\u2019 she went an\u2019 had Grawp here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGrawp?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYeah . . . well, tha\u2019s what it sounds like when he says his name,\u201d said Hagrid anxiously. \u201cHe don\u2019 speak a lot of English. . . . I\u2019ve bin tryin\u2019 ter teach him. . . . Anyway, she don\u2019 seem ter have liked him much more\u2019n she liked me. . . . See, with giantesses, what counts is producin\u2019 good big kids, and he\u2019s always been a bit on the runty side fer a giant \u2014 on\u2019y sixteen foot \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, tiny!\u201d said Hermione, with a kind of hysterical sarcasm. \u201cAbsolutely minuscule!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was bein\u2019 kicked around by all o\u2019 them \u2014 I jus\u2019 couldn\u2019 leave him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Madame Maxime want to bring him back?\u201d asked Harry.\n\n\u201cShe \u2014 well, she could see it was right importan\u2019 ter me,\u201d said Hagrid, twisting his enormous hands. \u201cBu\u2019 \u2014 bu\u2019 she got a bit tired of him after a while, I must admit . . . so we split up on the journey home. . . . She promised not ter tell anyone though . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, tha\u2019s why it took so long, see,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cCould on\u2019y travel by nigh\u2019 an\u2019 through wild country an\u2019 stuff. \u2019Course, he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter, but he kep\u2019 wantin\u2019 ter go back . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Hagrid, why on earth didn\u2019t you let him!\u201d said Hermione, flopping down onto a ripped-up tree and burying her face in her hands. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to do with a violent giant who doesn\u2019t even want to be here!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now \u2014 \u2018violent\u2019 \u2014 tha\u2019s a bit harsh,\u201d said Hagrid, still twisting his hands agitatedly. \u201cI\u2019ll admit he mighta taken a couple o\u2019 swings at me when he\u2019s bin in a bad mood, but he\u2019s gettin\u2019 better, loads better, settlin\u2019 down well . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are those ropes for, then?\u201d Harry asked.\n\nHe had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees toward the place where Grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep him tied up?\u201d said Hermione faintly.\n\n\u201cWell . . . yeah . . .\u201d said Hagrid, looking anxious. \u201cSee \u2014 it\u2019s like I say \u2014 he doesn\u2019 really know his strength \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest.\n\n\u201cSo what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do?\u201d Hermione asked apprehensively.\n\n\u201cLook after him,\u201d said Hagrid croakily. \u201cAfter I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do whatever he asked.\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 what does that involve, exactly?\u201d Hermione inquired.\n\n\u201cNot food or anythin\u2019!\u201d said Hagrid eagerly. \u201cHe can get his own food, no problem. Birds an\u2019 deer an\u2019 stuff . . . No, it\u2019s company he needs. If I jus\u2019 knew someone was carryin\u2019 on tryin\u2019 ter help him a bit . . . teachin\u2019 him, yeh know . . .\u201d\n\nHarry said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them. Grawp had his back to them. Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like a very oversize human, Grawp looked strangely misshapen. What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognized as Grawp\u2019s head. It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head, almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling, close-growing hair the color of bracken. The rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon\u2019s, directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between. The back, under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together, was very broad, and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under the body; Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet, large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest floor.\n\n\u201cYou want us to teach him,\u201d Harry said in a hollow voice. He now understood what Firenze\u2019s warning had meant. His attempt is not working. He would do better to abandon it. Of course, the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard Hagrid\u2019s fruitless attempts to teach Grawp English. . . .\n\n\u201cYeah \u2014 even if yeh jus\u2019 talk ter him a bit,\u201d said Hagrid hopefully. \u201c\u2019Cause I reckon, if he can talk ter people, he\u2019ll understand more that we all like him really, an\u2019 want him to stay . . .\u201d\n\nHarry looked at Hermione, who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face.\n\n\u201cKind of makes you wish we had Norbert back, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said and she gave a very shaky laugh.\n\n\u201cYeh\u2019ll do it, then?\u201d said Hagrid, who did not seem to have caught what Harry had just said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll . . .\u201d said Harry, already bound by his promise. \u201cWe\u2019ll try, Hagrid . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew I could count on yeh, Harry,\u201d Hagrid said, beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again. \u201cAn\u2019 I don\u2019 wan\u2019 yeh ter put yerself out too much, like. . . . I know yeh\u2019ve got exams. . . . If yeh could jus\u2019 nip down here in yer Invisibility Cloak maybe once a week an\u2019 have a little chat with him . . . I\u2019ll wake him up, then \u2014 introduce you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWha \u2014 no!\u201d said Hermione, jumping up, \u201cHagrid, no, don\u2019t wake him, really, we don\u2019t need \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Hagrid had already stepped over the great trunk in front of them and was proceeding toward Grawp. When he was around ten feet away, he lifted a long, broken bough from the ground, smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione, and then poked Grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough.\n\nThe giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest. Birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself onto his knees and turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him.\n\n\u201cAll righ\u2019, Grawpy?\u201d said Hagrid in a would-be cheery voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready to poke Grawp again. \u201cHad a nice sleep, eh?\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face, which resembled a gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn onto a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks. The small eyes were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half gummed together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles as big as cricket balls to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility.\n\n\u201cOh my . . .\u201d Harry heard Hermione squeal, terrified, beside him.\n\nThe trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp\u2019s wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, he reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird\u2019s nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it \u2014 eggs fell like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself.\n\n\u201cAnyway, Grawpy,\u201d shouted Hagrid, looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, \u201cI\u2019ve brought some friends ter meet yeh. Remember, I told yeh I might? Remember, when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an\u2019 leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit? Remember that, Grawpy?\u201d\n\nBut Grawp merely gave another low roar; it was hard to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether he even recognized the sounds Hagrid was making as speech. He had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it toward him, evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go.\n\n\u201cNow, Grawpy, don\u2019 do that!\u201d shouted Hagrid. \u201cTha\u2019s how you ended up pullin\u2019 up the others \u2014\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough, Harry could see the earth around the tree\u2019s roots beginning to crack.\n\n\u201cI got company fer yeh!\u201d Hagrid shouted. \u201cCompany, see! Look down, yeh big buffoon, I brought yeh some friends!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Hagrid, don\u2019t,\u201d moaned Hermione, but Hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave Grawp\u2019s knee a sharp poke.\n\nThe giant let go of the top of the pine tree, which swayed menacingly and deluged Hagrid with a rain of needles, and looked down.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Hagrid, hastening over to where Harry and Hermione stood, \u201cis Harry, Grawp! Harry Potter! He migh\u2019 be comin\u2019 ter visit yeh if I have ter go away, understand?\u201d\n\nThe giant had only just realized that Harry and Hermione were there. They watched, in great trepidation, as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 this is Hermione, see? Her \u2014\u201d Hagrid hesitated. Turning to Hermione he said, \u201cWould yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy, Hermione? On\u2019y it\u2019s a difficult name fer him ter remember . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d squeaked Hermione.\n\n\u201cThis is Hermy, Grawp! An\u2019 she\u2019s gonna be comin\u2019 an\u2019 all! Is\u2019n tha\u2019 nice? Eh? Two friends fer yeh ter \u2014 GRAWPY, NO!\u201d\n\nGrawp\u2019s hand had shot out of nowhere toward Hermione \u2014 Harry seized her and pulled her backward behind the tree, so that Grawp\u2019s fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air.\n\n\u201cBAD BOY, GRAWPY!\u201d Harry heard Hagrid yelling, as Hermione clung to Harry behind the tree, shaking and whimpering. \u201cVERY BAD BOY! YEH DON\u2019 GRAB \u2014 OUCH!\u201d\n\nHarry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw Hagrid lying on his back, his hand over his nose. Grawp, apparently losing interest, had straightened up again and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go.\n\n\u201cRigh\u2019,\u201d said Hagrid thickly, getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow. \u201cWell . . . there yeh are. . . . Yeh\u2019ve met him an\u2019 \u2014 an\u2019 now he\u2019ll know yeh when yeh come back. Yeah . . . well . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked up at Grawp, who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face; the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground. . . .\n\n\u201cWell, I reckon tha\u2019s enough fer one day,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cWe\u2019ll \u2014 er \u2014 we\u2019ll go back now, shall we?\u201d\n\nHarry and Hermione nodded. Hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and, still pinching his nose, led the way back into the trees.\n\nNobody spoke for a while, not even when they heard the distant crash that meant Grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last. Hermione\u2019s face was pale and set. Harry could not think of a single thing to say. What on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that Hagrid had hidden Grawp in the forest? And he had promised that he, Ron, and Hermione would continue Hagrid\u2019s totally pointless attempts to civilize the giant. . . . How could Hagrid, even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were lovably harmless, fool himself that Grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans?\n\n\u201cHold it,\u201d said Hagrid abruptly, just as Harry and Hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him. He pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow. Harry and Hermione raised their wands; now that they had stopped walking, they too could hear movement close by.\n\n\u201cOh blimey,\u201d said Hagrid quietly.\n\n\u201cI thought that we told you, Hagrid,\u201d said a deep male voice, \u201cthat you are no longer welcome here?\u201d\n\nA man\u2019s naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating toward them through the dappled green half-light. Then they saw that his waist joined smoothly with a horse\u2019s chestnut body. This centaur had a proud, high-cheekboned face and long black hair. Like Hagrid, he was armed: A quiverful of arrows and a long bow were slung over his shoulders.\n\n\u201cHow are yeh, Magorian?\u201d said Hagrid warily.\n\nThe trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged behind him. Harry recognized the black-bodied and bearded Bane, whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met Firenze. Bane gave no sign that he had ever seen Harry before.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said, with a nasty inflection in his voice, before turning immediately to Magorian. \u201cWe agreed, I think, what we would do if this human showed his face in the forest again?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018This human\u2019 now, am I?\u201d said Hagrid testily. \u201cJus\u2019 fer stoppin\u2019 all of yeh committin\u2019 murder?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ought not to have meddled, Hagrid,\u201d said Magorian. \u201cOur ways are not yours, nor are our laws. Firenze has betrayed and dishonored us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno how yeh work that out,\u201d said Hagrid impatiently. \u201cHe\u2019s done nothin\u2019 except help Albus Dumbledore \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cFirenze has entered into servitude to humans,\u201d said a gray centaur with a hard, deeply lined face.\n\n\u201cServitude!\u201d said Hagrid scathingly. \u201cHe\u2019s doin\u2019 Dumbledore a favor is all \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans,\u201d said Magorian quietly. \u201cThere can be no return from such disgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf yeh say so,\u201d said Hagrid, shrugging, \u201cbut personally I think yeh\u2019re makin\u2019 a big mistake \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAs are you, human,\u201d said Bane, \u201ccoming back into our forest when we warned you \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, you listen ter me,\u201d said Hagrid angrily. \u201cI\u2019ll have less of the \u2018our\u2019 forest, if it\u2019s all the same ter you. It\u2019s not up ter you who comes an\u2019 goes in here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more is it up to you, Hagrid,\u201d said Magorian smoothly. \u201cI shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not his!\u201d interrupted Bane contemptuously. \u201cStudents, Magorian, from up at the school! They have probably already profited from the traitor Firenze\u2019s teachings . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d said Magorian calmly, \u201cthe slaughter of foals is a terrible crime. . . . We do not touch the innocent. Today, Hagrid, you pass. Henceforth, stay away from this place. You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019 be kept outta the fores\u2019 by a bunch of mules like you!\u201d said Hagrid loudly.\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Hermione in a high-pitched and terrified voice, as both Bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground, \u201clet\u2019s go, please let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nHagrid moved forward, but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon Magorian.\n\n\u201cWe know what you are keeping in the forest, Hagrid!\u201d Magorian called after them, as the centaurs slipped out of sight. \u201cAnd our tolerance is waning!\u201d\n\nHagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to Magorian again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tolerate him as long as he\u2019s here, it\u2019s as much his forest as yours!\u201d he yelled, while Harry and Hermione both pushed with all their might against Hagrid\u2019s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forward. Still scowling, he looked down; his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him. He seemed not to have felt it.\n\n\u201cCalm down, you two,\u201d he said, turning to walk on while they panted along behind him. \u201cRuddy old nags though, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Hermione breathlessly, skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there, \u201cif the centaurs don\u2019t want humans in the forest, it doesn\u2019t really look as though Harry and I will be able \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you heard what they said,\u201d said Hagrid dismissively. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t hurt foals \u2014 I mean, kids. Anyway, we can\u2019 let ourselves be pushed around by that lot . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNice try,\u201d Harry murmured to Hermione, who looked crestfallen.\n\nAt last they rejoined the path and after another ten minutes, the trees began to thin. They were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and hear, in the distance, the definite sounds of cheering and shouting.\n\n\u201cWas that another goal?\u201d asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view. \u201cOr d\u2019you reckon the match is over?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear; her hair was full of bits of twig and leaves, her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms. He knew he could look little better.\n\n\u201cI reckon it\u2019s over, yeh know!\u201d said Hagrid, still squinting toward the stadium. \u201cLook \u2014 there\u2019s people comin\u2019 out already \u2014 if you two hurry yeh\u2019ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an\u2019 no one\u2019ll know you weren\u2019t there!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell . . . see you later, then, Hagrid . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe him,\u201d said Hermione in a very unsteady voice, the moment they were out of earshot of Hagrid. \u201cI don\u2019t believe him. I really don\u2019t believe him . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cCalm down!\u201d she said feverishly. \u201cA giant! A giant in the forest! And we\u2019re supposed to give him English lessons! Always assuming, of course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out! I \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 believe \u2014 him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t got to do anything yet!\u201d Harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice, as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back toward the castle. \u201cHe\u2019s not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come off it, Harry!\u201d said Hermione angrily, stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind her had to swerve to avoid her. \u201cOf course he\u2019s going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest, after what we\u2019ve just seen, who can blame Umbridge?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause in which Harry glared at her, and her eyes filled slowly with tears.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d said Harry quietly.\n\n\u201cNo . . . well . . . all right . . . I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes angrily. \u201cBut why does he have to make life so difficult for himself \u2014 for us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno \u2014\u201d\n\n\n\nWeasley is our King,\n\nWeasley is our King,\n\nHe didn\u2019t let the Quaffle in,\n\nWeasley is our King . . .\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I wish they\u2019d stop singing that stupid song,\u201d said Hermione miserably, \u201chaven\u2019t they gloated enough?\u201d\n\nA great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch.\n\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s get in before we have to meet the Slytherins,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\n\nWeasley can save anything,\n\nHe never leaves a single ring,\n\nThat\u2019s why Gryffindors all sing:\n\nWeasley is our King.\n\n\n\n\u201cHermione . . .\u201d said Harry slowly.\n\nThe song was growing louder, but it was issuing not from a crowd of green-and-silver-clad Slytherins, but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly toward the castle, which was bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders. . . .\n\n\n\nWeasley is our King,\n\nWeasley is our King,\n\nHe didn\u2019t let the Quaffle in,\n\nWeasley is our King . . .\n\n\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione in a hushed voice.\n\n\u201cYES!\u201d said Harry loudly.\n\n\u201cHARRY! HERMIONE!\u201d yelled Ron, waving the silver Quidditch Cup in the air and looking quite beside himself. \u201cWE DID IT! WE WON!\u201d\n\nThey beamed up at him as he passed; there was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron\u2019s head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight. Harry and Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of \u201cWeasley Is Our King\u201d died away. Then they turned to each other, their smiles fading.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll save our news till tomorrow, shall we?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cYes, all right,\u201d said Hermione wearily. \u201cI\u2019m not in any hurry . . .\u201d\n\nThey climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest. Harry was not sure whether it was his imagination or not, but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the treetops in the distance, almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter31": "O.W.L.S\n\n\n\n\nRon\u2019s euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch Cup was such that he could not settle to anything next day. All he wanted to do was talk over the match and Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp \u2014 not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in studying under the beech tree on the edge of the lake, where they stood less chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first; he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by Gryffindors walking past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of \u201cWeasley Is Our King,\u201d but agreed after a while that some fresh air might do him good.\n\nThey spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time.\n\n\u201cWell, I mean, I\u2019d already let in that one of Davies\u2019s, so I wasn\u2019t feeling that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came toward me, just out of nowhere, I thought \u2014 you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goal hoop \u2014 my right, obviously, his left \u2014 but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left \u2014 his right, I mean \u2014 and \u2014 well \u2014 you saw what happened,\u201d he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to them \u2014 a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepuffs \u2014 had heard him. \u201cAnd then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later \u2014 what?\u201d Ron said, stopping mid-sentence at the look on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cWhy are you grinning?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d said Harry quickly, looking down at his Transfiguration notes and attempting to straighten his face. The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. \u201cI\u2019m just glad we won, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron slowly, savoring the words, \u201cwe won. Did you see the look on Chang\u2019s face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose she cried, did she?\u201d said Harry bitterly.\n\n\u201cWell, yeah \u2014 more out of temper than anything, though . . .\u201d Ron frowned slightly. \u201cBut you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, actually . . . no, Ron,\u201d said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically. \u201cAs a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies\u2019s first goal.\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t watch?\u201d he said faintly, looking from one to the other. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see me make any of those saves?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell \u2014 no,\u201d said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand toward him. \u201cBut Ron, we didn\u2019t want to leave \u2014 we had to!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. \u201cHow come?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was Hagrid,\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe decided to tell us why he\u2019s been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted us to go into the forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he gets. . . . Anyway . . .\u201d\n\nThe story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron\u2019s indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity.\n\n\u201cHe brought one back and hid it in the forest?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d said Harry grimly.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue. \u201cNo, he can\u2019t have . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he has,\u201d said Hermione firmly. \u201cGrawp\u2019s about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,\u201d she snorted, \u201cas Hermy.\u201d\n\nRon gave a nervous laugh.\n\n\u201cAnd Hagrid wants us to . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach him English, yeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lost his mind,\u201d said Ron in an almost awed voice.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses. \u201cYes, I\u2019m starting to think he has. But unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re just going to have to break your promise, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Ron firmly. \u201cI mean, come on . . . We\u2019ve got exams and we\u2019re about that far,\u201d he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger a millimeter apart, \u201cfrom being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . remember Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid\u2019s monster mates?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s just that \u2014 we promised,\u201d said Hermione in a small voice.\n\nRon smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he sighed, \u201cHagrid hasn\u2019t been sacked yet, has he? He\u2019s hung on this long, maybe he\u2019ll hang on till the end of term and we won\u2019t have to go near Grawp at all.\u201d\n\n\nThe castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake, the satin-green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze: June had arrived, but to the fifth years this meant only one thing: Their O.W.L.s were upon them at last.\n\nTheir teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to reviewing those topics their teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the O.W.L.s from Harry\u2019s mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Occlumency tuition: If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency. She was spending a lot of time muttering to herself and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.\n\nShe was not the only person acting oddly as the O.W.L.s drew steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their study habits.\n\n\u201cHow many hours d\u2019you think you\u2019re doing a day?\u201d he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Ron. \u201cA few . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less than eight?\u201d\n\n\u201cLess, I s\u2019pose,\u201d said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing eight,\u201d said Ernie, puffing out his chest. \u201cEight or nine. I\u2019m getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eight\u2019s my average. I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday. Not so good on Tuesday \u2014 only seven and a quarter. Then on Wednesday \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital.\n\nMeanwhile Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic.\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s not what you know,\u201d he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, \u201cit\u2019s who you know. Now, Father\u2019s been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years \u2014 old Griselda Marchbanks \u2014 we\u2019ve had her round for dinner and everything . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s true?\u201d Hermione whispered to Harry and Ron, looking frightened.\n\n\u201cNothing we can do about it if it is,\u201d said Ron gloomily.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s true,\u201d said Neville quietly from behind them. \u201cBecause Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran\u2019s, and she\u2019s never mentioned the Malfoys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she like, Neville?\u201d asked Hermione at once. \u201cIs she strict?\u201d\n\n\u201cBit like Gran, really,\u201d said Neville in a subdued voice.\n\n\u201cKnowing her won\u2019t hurt your chances though, will it?\u201d Ron told him encouragingly.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think it will make any difference,\u201d said Neville, still more miserably. \u201cGran\u2019s always telling Professor Marchbanks I\u2019m not as good as my dad. . . . Well . . . you saw what she\u2019s like at St. Mungo\u2019s . . .\u201d\n\nNeville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron, and Hermione glanced at one another, but didn\u2019t know what to say. It was the first time that Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the Wizarding hospital.\n\nMeanwhile a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility, and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth and seventh years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio\u2019s Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine \u201cOutstanding\u201d O.W.L.s he had gained the previous summer and was offering the whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.\n\n\u201cHermione, we wanted to buy that!\u201d shouted Ron.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d she snarled. \u201cYou might as well take Harold Dingle\u2019s powdered dragon claw and have done with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDingle\u2019s got powdered dragon claw?\u201d said Ron eagerly.\n\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cI confiscated that too. None of these things actually work you know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDragon claw does work!\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours \u2014 Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can\u2019t hurt \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis stuff can,\u201d said Hermione grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve had a look at it, and it\u2019s actually dried doxy droppings.\u201d\n\nThis information took the edge off Harry and Ron\u2019s desire for brain stimulants.\n\nThey received their examination schedules and details of the procedure for O.W.L.s during their next Transfiguration lesson.\n\n\u201cAs you can see,\u201d Professor McGonagall told the class while they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, \u201cyour O.W.L.s are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night.\n\n\u201cNow, I must warn you that the most stringent Anti-Cheating Charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs, and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbor at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority\u2019s rules. I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new \u2014 headmistress\u201d \u2014 Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt \u2014 \u201chas asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely \u2014 because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the headmistress\u2019s new regime at the school . . .\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh. Harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare.\n\n\u201cHowever, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Professor,\u201d said Hermione, her hand in the air, \u201cwhen will we find out our results?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn owl will be sent to you some time in July,\u201d said Professor McGonagall.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, \u201cso we don\u2019t have to worry about it till the holidays . . .\u201d\n\nHarry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks\u2019 time, waiting for his O.W.L. results. Well, he thought, at least he would be sure of one bit of post next summer. . . .\n\nTheir first exam, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday but regretted it almost at once. She was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had gotten the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just do it yourself?\u201d he said firmly, handing the book back to her, his eyes watering.\n\nMeanwhile Ron was reading two years of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm, while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practicing basic locomotion charms, were making their pencil cases race each other around the edge of the table.\n\nDinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione on the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate.\n\n\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d she said faintly, staring into the entrance hall. \u201cIs that them? Is that the examiners?\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge, Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.\n\n\u201cShall we go and have a closer look?\u201d said Ron.\n\nHarry and Hermione nodded and they hastened toward the double doors into the entrance hall, slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was speaking to her very deferentially. Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf; she was answering Umbridge very loudly considering that they were only a foot apart.\n\n\u201cJourney was fine, journey was fine, we\u2019ve made it plenty of times before!\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cNow, I haven\u2019t heard from Dumbledore lately!\u201d she added, peering around the hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. \u201cNo idea where he is, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace. \u201cBut I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, \u201cnot if Dumbledore doesn\u2019t want to be found! I should know. . . . Examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s . . . Did things with a wand I\u2019d never seen before . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes . . . well . . .\u201d said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron, and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared, \u201clet me show you to the staffroom . . . I daresay you\u2019d like a cup of tea after your journey . . .\u201d\n\nIt was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was trying to do some last-minute studying but nobody seemed to be getting very far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours. He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall\u2019s furious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was the last thing she did. . . . He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here. . . . He knew that he was not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, they fell asleep.\n\nNone of the fifth years talked very much at breakfast next day either. Parvati was practicing incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched, Hermione was rereading Achievement in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred, and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.\n\nOnce breakfast was over, the fifth and seventh years milled around in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons. Then, at half-past nine, they were called forward class by class to reenter the Great Hall, which was now arranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius, and Snape had been taking their O.W.L.s. The four House tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them. When they were all seated and quiet she said, \u201cYou may begin,\u201d and turned over an enormous hourglass on the desk beside her, on which were also spare quills, ink bottles, and rolls of parchment.\n\nHarry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard. . . . Three rows to his right and four seats ahead, Hermione was already scribbling. . . . He lowered his eyes to the first question: a) Give the incantation, and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly. . . .\n\nHarry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll. . . . Smiling slightly, he bent over the paper and began to write. . . .\n\n\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t too bad, was it?\u201d asked Hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of time \u2014 did you put in the countercharm for hiccups? I wasn\u2019t sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much \u2014 and on question twenty-three \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d said Ron sternly, \u201cwe\u2019ve been through this before. . . . We\u2019re not going through every exam afterward, it\u2019s bad enough doing them once.\u201d\n\nThe fifth years ate lunch with the rest of the school (the four House tables reappeared over the lunch hour) and then trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until called for their practical examination. As small groups of students were called forward in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered incantations and practiced wand movements, occasionally poking one another in the back or eye by mistake.\n\nHermione\u2019s name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine \u2014 remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests?\u201d said Ron.\n\nTen minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, \u201cParkinson, Pansy \u2014 Patil, Padma \u2014 Patil, Parvati \u2014 Potter, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck,\u201d said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook.\n\n\u201cProfessor Tofty is free, Potter,\u201d squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was standing just inside the door. He pointed Harry toward what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner, who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy.\n\n\u201cPotter, is it?\u201d said Professor Tofty, consulting his notes and peering over his pince-nez at Harry as he approached. \u201cThe famous Potter?\u201d\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a scathing look over at him; the wine glass Malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed. Harry could not suppress a grin. Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said in his quavery old voice, \u201cno need to be nervous. . . . Now, if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some cartwheels for me . . .\u201d\n\nOn the whole Harry thought it went rather well; his Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy\u2019s had been, though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Color-Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his mistake. He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterward. He could tell Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.\n\nThere was no time to relax that night \u2014 they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for Transfiguration next day. Harry went to bed, his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories.\n\nHe forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written exam next morning, but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. At least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minutes while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.\n\nThey had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably well) and then, on Thursday, Defense Against the Dark Arts. Here, for the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall.\n\n\u201cOh bravo!\u201d cried Professor Tofty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell. \u201cVery good indeed! Well, I think that\u2019s all, Potter . . . unless . . .\u201d\n\nHe leaned forward a little.\n\n\u201cI heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?\u201d\n\nHarry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge, and imagined her being sacked.\n\n\u201cExpecto Patronum!\u201d\n\nThe silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist, Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d he said. \u201cVery well, Potter, you may go!\u201d\n\nAs Harry passed Umbridge beside the door their eyes met. There was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did not care. Unless he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning on saying it to anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an \u201cOutstanding\u201d O.W.L.\n\nOn Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of them, they permitted themselves a break from studying. They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air wafted over them as they played a desultory game of wizard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the forest. He was trying to guess what creatures they were examining \u2014 he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little \u2014 when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad tempered.\n\n\u201cHow were the runes?\u201d said Ron, yawning and stretching.\n\n\u201cI mistranslated \u2018ehwaz,\u2019\u201d said Hermione furiously. \u201cIt means \u2018partnership,\u2019 not \u2018defense,\u2019 I mixed it up with \u2018eihwaz.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAh well,\u201d said Ron lazily, \u201cthat\u2019s only one mistake, isn\u2019t it, you\u2019ll still get \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh shut up,\u201d said Hermione angrily, \u201cit could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail. And what\u2019s more, someone\u2019s put another niffler in Umbridge\u2019s office, I don\u2019t know how they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off \u2014 by the sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her leg \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Harry and Ron together.\n\n\u201cIt is not good!\u201d said Hermione hotly. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s Hagrid doing it, remember? And we do not want Hagrid chucked out!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s teaching at the moment, she can\u2019t blame him,\u201d said Harry, gesturing out of the window.\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re so naive sometimes, Harry, you really think Umbridge will wait for proof?\u201d said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off toward the girls\u2019 dormitories, banging the door behind her.\n\n\u201cSuch a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,\u201d said Ron, very quietly, prodding his queen forward so that she could begin beating up one of Harry\u2019s knights.\n\nHermione\u2019s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday studying for Potions on Monday, the exam to which Harry was looking forward least and which he was sure would be the one that would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror. Sure enough, he found the written exam difficult, though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion: He could describe its effects extremely accurately, having taken it illegally in his second year.\n\nThe afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be. With Snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions. Neville, who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had ever seen him during a Potions class. When Professor Marchbanks said, \u201cStep away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,\u201d Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but that he had, with luck, avoided a fail.\n\n\u201cOnly four exams left,\u201d said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common room.\n\n\u201cOnly!\u201d said Hermione snappishly. \u201cI\u2019ve got Arithmancy and it\u2019s probably the toughest subject there is!\u201d\n\nNobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first years for giggling too loudly in the common room.\n\nHarry was determined to perform well in Tuesday\u2019s Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down. The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs (the trick was to offer them all milk in turn: knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them); then demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle, feed and clean a fire-crab without sustaining serious burns, and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would give a sick unicorn.\n\nHarry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window. When Harry\u2019s examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at him and told him he could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting thumbs-up before heading back up to the castle.\n\nThe Astronomy theory exam on Wednesday morning went well enough; Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all of Jupiter\u2019s moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice. They had to wait until evening for their practical Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination.\n\nEven by Harry\u2019s low standards in Divination, the exam went very badly. He might as well have tried to see moving pictures in the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he lost his head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWell, we were always going to fail that one,\u201d said Ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase. He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look up and realize he had been describing his examiner\u2019s reflection.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have taken the stupid subject in the first place,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cStill, at least we can give it up now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry. \u201cNo more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd from now on, I don\u2019t care if my tea leaves spell die, Ron, die \u2014 I\u2019m just chucking them in the bin where they belong.\u201d\n\nHarry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them. He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her.\n\n\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ve done all right in Arithmancy,\u201d she said, and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief. \u201cJust time for a quick look over our star charts before dinner, then . . .\u201d\n\nWhen they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o\u2019clock they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still. The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight, and there was a slight chill in the air. Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank star chart he or she had been given.\n\nProfessors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them, watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing. All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scribbling of many quills. Half an hour passed, then an hour; the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished.\n\nAs Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart, however, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn. Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more.\n\nHarry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted him. Pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they stood. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling that he recognized the walk of the squattest among them, who seemed to be leading the group.\n\nHe could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside past midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam. He had quite forgotten Venus\u2019s position \u2014 jamming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was again on the point of entering it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he heard a distant knock that echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.\n\nHe looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Hagrid\u2019s windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw six tiny but sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door closed again and there was silence.\n\nHarry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment, and not wanting to appear as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else\u2019s work, he hastily bent over his star chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet toward Hagrid\u2019s cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light.\n\nHe could feel Professor Marchbanks\u2019s eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid\u2019s cabin.\n\nProfessor Tofty gave another dry little cough.\n\n\u201cTry and concentrate, now, boys and girls,\u201d he said softly.\n\nMost people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his left. Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAhem \u2014 twenty minutes to go,\u201d said Professor Tofty.\n\nHermione jumped and returned at once to her star chart; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mislabelled Venus as Mars. He bent to correct it.\n\nThere was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people said \u201cOuch!\u201d as they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes, hastening to see what was going on below.\n\nHagrid\u2019s door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun him.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried Hermione.\n\n\u201cMy dear!\u201d said Professor Tofty in a scandalized voice. \u201cThis is an examination!\u201d\n\nBut nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star charts anymore: Jets of red light were still flying beside Hagrid\u2019s cabin, yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him. He was still upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed across the grounds; a man yelled, \u201cBe reasonable, Hagrid!\u201d and Hagrid roared, \u201cReasonable be damned, yeh won\u2019 take me like this, Dawlish!\u201d\n\nHarry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury, lifted the culprit bodily from the ground, and threw him: The man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again. Hermione gasped, both hands over her mouth; Harry looked around at Ron and saw that he too was looking scared. None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before. . . .\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors seemed to have opened again; more light had spilled out onto the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn.\n\n\u201cNow, really!\u201d said Professor Tofty anxiously. \u201cOnly sixteen minutes left, you know!\u201d\n\nBut nobody paid him the slightest attention: They were watching the person now sprinting toward the battle beside Hagrid\u2019s cabin.\n\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d the figure shouted as she ran. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s McGonagall!\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cLeave him alone! Alone, I say!\u201d said Professor McGonagall\u2019s voice through the darkness. \u201cOn what grounds are you attacking him? He has done nothing, nothing to warrant such \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione, Parvati, and Lavender all screamed. No fewer than four Stunners had shot from the figures around the cabin toward Professor McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her. For a moment she looked luminous, illuminated by an eerie red glow, then was lifted right off her feet, landed hard on her back, and moved no more.\n\n\u201cGalloping gargoyles!\u201d shouted Professor Tofty, who seemed to have forgotten the exam completely. \u201cNot so much as a warning! Outrageous behavior!\u201d\n\n\u201cCOWARDS!\u201d bellowed Hagrid, his voice carrying clearly to the top of the tower, and several lights flickered back on inside the castle. \u201cRUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O\u2019 THAT \u2014 AN\u2019 THAT \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my \u2014\u201d gasped Hermione.\n\nHagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold. Harry saw him double over and thought for a moment that he had finally been overcome by a spell, but on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back \u2014 then Harry realized that Fang\u2019s limp body was draped around his shoulders.\n\n\u201cGet him, get him!\u201d screamed Umbridge, but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid\u2019s fists. Indeed, he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck; Umbridge sent one last Stunning Spell after him but it missed, and Hagrid, running full-pelt toward the distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.\n\nThere was a long minute\u2019s quivering silence, everybody gazing openmouthed into the grounds. Then Professor Tofty\u2019s voice said feebly, \u201cUm . . . five minutes to go, everybody . . .\u201d\n\nThough he had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was desperate for the end of the exam. When it came at last he, Ron, and Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were going to bed \u2014 they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed.\n\n\u201cThat evil woman!\u201d gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage. \u201cTrying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney\u2019s,\u201d said Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them.\n\n\u201cHagrid did well, didn\u2019t he?\u201d said Ron, who looked more alarmed than impressed. \u201cHow come all the spells bounced off him?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be his giant blood,\u201d said Hermione shakily. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to Stun a giant, they\u2019re like trolls, really tough. . . . But poor Professor McGonagall. . . . Four Stunners straight in the chest, and she\u2019s not exactly young, is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cDreadful, dreadful,\u201d said Ernie, shaking his head pompously. \u201cWell, I\u2019m off to bed . . . \u2019Night, all . . .\u201d\n\nPeople around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what they had just seen.\n\n\u201cAt least they didn\u2019t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI \u2019spect he\u2019s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Hermione, who looked tearful. \u201cOh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we\u2019ve lost Hagrid too . . .\u201d\n\nThey traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.\n\n\u201cBut why sack Hagrid now?\u201d asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Trelawney, he\u2019s been teaching much better than usual this year!\u201d\n\n\u201cUmbridge hates part-humans,\u201d said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair. \u201cShe was always going to try and get Hagrid out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she thought Hagrid was putting nifflers in her office,\u201d piped up Katie Bell.\n\n\u201cOh blimey,\u201d said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s me\u2019s been putting the nifflers in her office, Fred and George left me a couple, I\u2019ve been levitating them in through her window . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d have sacked him anyway,\u201d said Dean. \u201cHe was too close to Dumbledore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermione\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI just hope Professor McGonagall\u2019s all right,\u201d said Lavender tearfully.\n\n\u201cThey carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,\u201d said Colin Creevey. \u201cShe didn\u2019t look very well . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMadam Pomfrey will sort her out,\u201d said Alicia Spinnet firmly. \u201cShe\u2019s never failed yet.\u201d\n\nIt was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared. Harry felt wide awake \u2014 the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him. He was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron\u2019s suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.\n\nTheir final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-minute studying, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the common room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the notes stacked three-and-a-half feet high that Hermione had lent him.\n\nThe fifth years entered the Great Hall at two o\u2019clock and took their places in front of their overturned examination papers. Harry felt exhausted. He just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep. Then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch \u2014 he was going to have a fly on Ron\u2019s broom and savor their freedom from studying. . . .\n\n\u201cTurn over your papers,\u201d said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hourglass. \u201cYou may begin . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stared fixedly at the first question. It was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it; there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows. Slowly, tortuously, he began to write an answer.\n\nHe was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates. He simply skipped question four: In your opinion, did wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of the eighteenth century? thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end. He had a stab at question five: How was the Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence? but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points. He had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere. . . .\n\nHe looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten.\n\nDescribe the circumstances that led to the Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join.\n\nI know this, Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack. He could visualize a heading, in Hermione\u2019s handwriting: The Formation of the International Confederation of Wizards . . . He had read these notes only this morning. . . .\n\nHe began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hourglass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks. He was sitting right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair. Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head very slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it.\n\n. . . the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, but his appointment was contested by the Wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because \u2014\n\nAll around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying, burrowing rats. The sun was very hot on the back of his head. What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein? Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls. . . . He gazed blankly at the back of Parvati\u2019s head again. If he could only perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein. . . .\n\nHarry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool. Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights . . . but Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls. . . . That was it. . . .\n\nHe opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing-white parchment. Slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then read through what he had done so far. It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet he was sure Hermione\u2019s notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages. . . .\n\nHe closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember. . . . The confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had written that already. . . .\n\nGoblins had tried to attend and been ousted. . . . He had written that too. . . .\n\nAnd nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come . . .\n\nThink, he told himself, his face in his hands, while all around him quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the hourglass at the front. . . .\n\nHe was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last. . . . The black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the circular room with its many doors. . . .\n\nStraight across the stone floor and through the second door . . . patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry. . . .\n\nHe jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others. . . .\n\nOnce again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres. . . . His heart was beating very fast now. . . . He was going to get there this time. . . . When he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows. . . .\n\nBut there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving upon the floor like a wounded animal. . . . Harry\u2019s stomach contracted with fear . . . with excitement. . . .\n\nA voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human kindness, \u201cTake it for me. . . . Lift it down, now. . . . I cannot touch it . . . but you can . . .\u201d\n\nThe black shape upon the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-fingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of his own arm . . . heard the high, cold voice say, \u201cCrucio!\u201d\n\nThe man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the curse lifted, and the figure groaned and became motionless.\n\n\u201cLord Voldemort is waiting . . .\u201d\n\nVery slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. His face was bloodstained and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance. . . .\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill me,\u201d whispered Sirius.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly I shall in the end,\u201d said the cold voice. \u201cBut you will fetch it for me first, Black. . . . You think you have felt pain thus far? Think again. . . . We have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream . . .\u201d\n\nBut somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again; somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk onto the cold stone floor. Harry hit the ground and awoke, still yelling, his scar on fire, as the Great Hall erupted all around him."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter32": "OUT OF THE FIRE\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not going. . . . I don\u2019t need the hospital wing. . . . I don\u2019t want . . .\u201d\n\nHe was gibbering, trying to pull away from Professor Tofty, who was looking at him with much concern, and who had just helped Harry out into the entrance hall while the students all around them stared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m fine, sir,\u201d Harry stammered, wiping the sweat from his face. \u201cReally . . . I just fell asleep. . . . Had a nightmare . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cPressure of examinations!\u201d said the old wizard sympathetically, patting Harry shakily on the shoulder. \u201cIt happens, young man, it happens! Now, a cooling drink of water, and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall? The examination is nearly over, but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry wildly. \u201cI mean . . . no . . . I\u2019ve done \u2014 done as much as I can, I think . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, very well,\u201d said the old wizard gently. \u201cI shall go and collect your examination paper, and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d said Harry, nodding vigorously. \u201cThanks very much.\u201d\n\nHe waited for the second when the old man\u2019s heels disappeared over the threshold into the Great Hall, then ran up the marble staircase and then more staircases toward the hospital wing, hurtling along the corridors so fast that the portraits he passed muttered reproaches, and burst through the double doors like a hurricane, causing Madam Pomfrey, who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into Montague\u2019s open mouth, to shriek in alarm.\n\n\u201cPotter, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to see Professor McGonagall,\u201d gasped Harry, the breath tearing his lungs. \u201cNow . . . It\u2019s urgent . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not here, Potter,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey sadly. \u201cShe was transferred to St. Mungo\u2019s this morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age? It\u2019s a wonder they didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s . . . gone?\u201d said Harry, stunned.\n\nThe bell rang just outside the dormitory, and he heard the usual distant rumbling of students starting to flood out into the corridors above and below him. He remained quite still, looking at Madam Pomfrey. Terror was rising inside him.\n\nThere was nobody left to tell. Dumbledore had gone, Hagrid had gone, but he had always expected Professor McGonagall to be there, irascible and inflexible, perhaps, but always dependably, solidly present. . . .\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wonder you\u2019re shocked, Potter,\u201d said Madam Pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face. \u201cAs if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on by daylight! Cowardice, that\u2019s what it was. . . . Despicable cowardice . . . If I wasn\u2019t worried what would happen to you students without me, I\u2019d resign in protest . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry blankly.\n\nHe strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood, buffeted by the crowd, the panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do. . . .\n\nRon and Hermione, said a voice in his head.\n\nHe was running again, pushing students out of the way, oblivious to their angry protests and shouts. He sprinted back down two floors and was at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying toward him.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d said Hermione at once, looking very frightened. \u201cWhat happened? Are you all right? Are you ill?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d demanded Ron.\n\n\u201cCome with me,\u201d Harry said quickly. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve got to tell you something . . .\u201d\n\nHe led them along the first-floor corridor, peering through doorways, and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived, closing the door behind Ron and Hermione the moment they were inside and leaning against it, facing them.\n\n\u201cVoldemort\u2019s got Sirius.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cSaw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 but where? How?\u201d said Hermione, whose face was white.\n\n\u201cI dunno how,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBut I know exactly where. There\u2019s a room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls, and they\u2019re at the end of row ninety-seven . . . He\u2019s trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there. . . . He\u2019s torturing him. . . . Says he\u2019ll end by killing him . . .\u201d\n\nHarry found his voice was shaking, as were his knees. He moved over to a desk and sat down on it, trying to master himself.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re we going to get there?\u201d he asked them.\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence. Then Ron said, \u201cG-get there?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet to the Department of Mysteries, so we can rescue Sirius!\u201d Harry said loudly.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 Harry . . .\u201d said Ron weakly.\n\n\u201cWhat? What?\u201d said Harry.\n\nHe could not understand why they were both gaping at him as though he was asking them something unreasonable.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Hermione in a rather frightened voice, \u201cer . . . how . . . how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he was there?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know?\u201d bellowed Harry. \u201cThe question is how we\u2019re going to get in there!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut . . . Harry, think about this,\u201d said Hermione, taking a step toward him, \u201cit\u2019s five o\u2019clock in the afternoon. . . . The Ministry of Magic must be full of workers. . . . How would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen? Harry . . . they\u2019re probably the two most wanted wizards in the world. . . . You think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cAnyway, the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I\u2019ve been \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never been there, Harry,\u201d said Hermione quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve dreamed about the place, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not normal dreams!\u201d Harry shouted in her face, standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn. He wanted to shake her. \u201cHow d\u2019you explain Ron\u2019s dad then, what was all that about, how come I knew what had happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a point,\u201d said Ron quietly, looking at Hermione.\n\n\u201cBut this is just \u2014 just so unlikely!\u201d said Hermione desperately. \u201cHarry, how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when he\u2019s been in Grimmauld Place all the time?\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius might\u2019ve cracked and just wanted some fresh air,\u201d said Ron, sounding worried. \u201cHe\u2019s been desperate to get out of that house for ages \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why,\u201d Hermione persisted, \u201cwhy on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, there could be loads of reasons!\u201d Harry yelled at her. \u201cMaybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort doesn\u2019t care about seeing hurt \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what, I\u2019ve just thought of something,\u201d said Ron in a hushed voice. \u201cSirius\u2019s brother was a Death Eater, wasn\u2019t he? Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah \u2014 and that\u2019s why Dumbledore\u2019s been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time!\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d cried Hermione, \u201cbut neither of you are making sense, and we\u2019ve got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, Harry\u2019s seen them!\u201d said Ron, rounding on her.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, looking frightened yet determined, \u201cI\u2019ve just got to say this . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou . . . This isn\u2019t a criticism, Harry! But you do . . . sort of . . . I mean \u2014 don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve got a bit of a \u2014 a \u2014 saving-people-thing?\u201d she said.\n\nHe glared at her. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that supposed to mean, a \u2018saving-people-thing\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . you . . .\u201d She looked more apprehensive than ever. \u201cI mean . . . last year, for instance . . . in the lake . . . during the Tournament . . . you shouldn\u2019t have . . . I mean, you didn\u2019t need to save that little Delacour girl. . . . You got a bit . . . carried away . . .\u201d\n\nA wave of hot, prickly anger swept Harry\u2019s body \u2014 how could she remind him of that blunder now?\n\n\u201c. . . I mean, it was really great of you and everything,\u201d said Hermione quickly, looking positively petrified at the look on Harry\u2019s face. \u201cEveryone thought it was a wonderful thing to do \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d said Harry in a trembling voice, \u201cbecause I definitely remember Ron saying I\u2019d wasted time acting the hero. . . . Is that what you think this is? You reckon I want to act the hero again?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d said Hermione, looking aghast. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean at all!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, spit out what you\u2019ve got to say, because we\u2019re wasting time here!\u201d Harry shouted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to say \u2014 Voldemort knows you, Harry! He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there, it\u2019s the kind of thing he does, he knows you\u2019re the \u2014 the sort of person who\u2019d go to Sirius\u2019s aid! What if he\u2019s just trying to get you into the Department of Myst \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s done it to get me there or not \u2014 they\u2019ve taken McGonagall to St. Mungo\u2019s, there isn\u2019t anyone left from the Order at Hogwarts who we can tell, and if we don\u2019t go, Sirius is dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Harry \u2014 what if your dream was \u2014 was just that, a dream?\u201d\n\nHarry let out a roar of frustration. Hermione actually stepped back from him, looking alarmed.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get it!\u201d Harry shouted at her. \u201cI\u2019m not having nightmares, I\u2019m not just dreaming! What d\u2019you think all the Occlumency was for, why d\u2019you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things? Because they\u2019re REAL, Hermione \u2014 Sirius is trapped \u2014 I\u2019ve seen him \u2014 Voldemort\u2019s got him, and no one else knows, and that means we\u2019re the only ones who can save him, and if you don\u2019t want to do it, fine, but I\u2019m going, understand? And if I remember rightly, you didn\u2019t have a problem with my saving-people-thing when it was you I was saving from the dementors, or\u201d \u2014 he rounded on Ron \u2014 \u201cwhen it was your sister I was saving from the basilisk \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said I had a problem!\u201d said Ron heatedly.\n\n\u201cBut Harry, you\u2019ve just said it,\u201d said Hermione fiercely. \u201cDumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you\u2019d done Occlumency properly you\u2019d never have seen this \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIF YOU THINK I\u2019M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN\u2019T SEEN \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind!\u201d\n\n\u201cWELL, I EXPECT HE\u2019D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF HE KNEW WHAT I\u2019D JUST \u2014\u201d\n\nThe classroom door opened. Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. Ginny walked in, looking curious, followed by Luna, who as usual looked as though she had drifted in accidentally.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Ginny uncertainly. \u201cWe recognized Harry\u2019s voice \u2014 what are you yelling about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever you mind,\u201d said Harry roughly.\n\nGinny raised her eyebrows.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to take that tone with me,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cI was only wondering whether I could help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t,\u201d said Harry shortly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being rather rude, you know,\u201d said Luna serenely.\n\nHarry swore and turned away. The very last thing he wanted now was a conversation with Luna Lovegood.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Hermione suddenly. \u201cWait . . . Harry, they can help.\u201d\n\nHarry and Ron looked at her.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d she said urgently, \u201cHarry, we need to establish whether Sirius really has left headquarters \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you, I saw \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019m begging you, please!\u201d said Hermione desperately. \u201cPlease let\u2019s just check that Sirius isn\u2019t at home before we go charging off to London \u2014 if we find out he\u2019s not there then I swear I won\u2019t try and stop you, I\u2019ll come, I\u2019ll d-do whatever it takes to try and save him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius is being tortured NOW!\u201d shouted Harry. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got time to waste \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if this is a trick of V-Voldemort\u2019s \u2014 Harry, we\u2019ve got to check, we\u2019ve got to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Harry demanded. \u201cHow\u2019re we going to check?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to use Umbridge\u2019s fire and see if we can contact him,\u201d said Hermione, who looked positively terrified at the thought. \u201cWe\u2019ll draw Umbridge away again, but we\u2019ll need lookouts, and that\u2019s where we can use Ginny and Luna.\u201d\n\nThough clearly struggling to understand what was going on, Ginny said immediately, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll do it,\u201d and Luna said, \u201cWhen you say \u2018Sirius,\u2019 are you talking about Stubby Boardman?\u201d\n\nNobody answered her.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry said aggressively to Hermione, \u201cOkay, if you can think of a way of doing this quickly, I\u2019m with you, otherwise I\u2019m going to the Department of Mysteries right now \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department of Mysteries?\u201d said Luna, looking mildly surprised. \u201cBut how are you going to get there?\u201d\n\nAgain, Harry ignored her.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Hermione, twisting her hands together and pacing up and down between the desks. \u201cRight . . . well . . . One of us has to go and find Umbridge and \u2014 and send her off in the wrong direction, keep her away from her office. They could tell her \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 that Peeves is up to something awful as usual . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d said Ron at once. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something, it\u2019s miles away from her office. Come to think of it, I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way . . .\u201d\n\nIt was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, her brow furrowed as she continued to pace. \u201cNow, we need to keep students away from her office while we force entry, or some Slytherin\u2019s bound to go and tip her off . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLuna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,\u201d said Ginny promptly, \u201cand warn people not to go down there because someone\u2019s let off a load of Garroting Gas.\u201d Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie. Ginny shrugged and said, \u201cFred and George were planning to do it before they left.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cwell then, Harry, you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak, and we\u2019ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not there, Hermione!\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, you can \u2014 can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch, I don\u2019t think you should be in there alone, Lee\u2019s already proved the window\u2019s a weak spot, sending those nifflers through it.\u201d\n\nEven through his anger and impatience Harry recognized Hermione\u2019s offer to accompany him into Umbridge\u2019s office as a sign of solidarity and loyalty.\n\n\u201cI . . . okay, thanks,\u201d he muttered.\n\n\u201cRight, well, even if we do all of that, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to bank on more than five minutes,\u201d said Hermione, looking relieved that Harry seemed to have accepted the plan, \u201cnot with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive minutes\u2019ll be enough,\u201d said Harry. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d said Hermione, looking shocked.\n\n\u201cOf course now!\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cWhat did you think, we\u2019re going to wait until after dinner or something? Hermione, Sirius is being tortured right now!\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 oh all right,\u201d she said desperately. \u201cYou go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we\u2019ll meet you at the end of Umbridge\u2019s corridor, okay?\u201d\n\nHarry did not answer, but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowds outside. Two floors up he met Seamus and Dean, who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusk-till-dawn end-of-exams celebration in the common room. Harry barely heard them. He scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many black-market butterbeers they would need and was climbing back out of it, the Invisibility Cloak and Sirius\u2019s knife secure in his bag, before they noticed he had left them.\n\n\u201cHarry, d\u2019you want to chip in a couple of Galleons? Harold Dingle reckons he could sell us some firewhisky . . .\u201d\n\nBut Harry was already tearing away back along the corridor, and a couple of minutes later was jumping the last few stairs to join Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, who were huddled together at the end of Umbridge\u2019s corridor.\n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d he panted. \u201cReady to go, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d whispered Hermione as a gang of loud sixth years passed them. \u201cSo Ron \u2014 you go and head Umbridge off. . . . Ginny, Luna, if you can start moving people out of the corridor. . . . Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear . . .\u201d\n\nRon strode away, his bright red hair visible right to the end of the passage. Meanwhile, Ginny\u2019s equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling students surrounding them in the other direction, trailed by Luna\u2019s blonde one.\n\n\u201cGet over here,\u201d muttered Hermione, tugging at Harry\u2019s wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column. \u201cAre \u2014 are you sure you\u2019re okay, Harry? You\u2019re still very pale . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said shortly, tugging the Invisibility Cloak from out of his bag. In truth, his scar was aching, but not so badly that he thought Voldemort had yet dealt Sirius a fatal blow. It had hurt much worse than this when Voldemort had been punishing Avery. . . .\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said. He threw the Invisibility Cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the Latin mumblings of the bust in front of them.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t come down here!\u201d Ginny was calling to the crowd. \u201cNo, sorry, you\u2019re going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase, someone\u2019s let off Garroting Gas just along here \u2014\u201d\n\nThey could hear people complaining; one surly voice said, \u201cI can\u2019t see no gas . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s colorless,\u201d said Ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice, \u201cbut if you want to walk through it, carry on, then we\u2019ll have your body as proof for the next idiot who didn\u2019t believe us . . .\u201d\n\nSlowly the crowd thinned. The news about the Garroting Gas seemed to have spread \u2014 people were not coming this way anymore. When at last the surrounding area was quite clear, Hermione said quietly, \u201cI think that\u2019s as good as we\u2019re going to get, Harry \u2014 come on, let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nTogether they moved forward, covered by the Cloak. Luna was standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor. As they passed Ginny, Hermione whispered, \u201cGood one . . . don\u2019t forget the signal . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the signal?\u201d muttered Harry, as they approached Umbridge\u2019s door.\n\n\u201cA loud chorus of \u2018Weasley Is Our King\u2019 if they see Umbridge coming,\u201d replied Hermione, as Harry inserted the blade of Sirius\u2019s knife in the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open, and they entered the office.\n\nThe garish kittens were basking in the late afternoon sunshine warming their plates, but otherwise the office was as still and empty as last time. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\u201cI thought she might have added extra security after the second niffler . . .\u201d\n\nThey pulled off the Cloak. Hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight, peering down into the grounds with her wand out. Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder, and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into life there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing fire, and cried, \u201cNumber twelve, Grimmauld Place!\u201d\n\nHis head began to spin as though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knees remained firmly planted upon the cold office floor. He kept his eyes screwed up against the whirling ash, and when the spinning stopped, he opened them to find himself looking out upon the long, cold kitchen of Grimmauld Place.\n\nThere was nobody there. He had expected this, yet was not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room.\n\n\u201cSirius?\u201d he shouted. \u201cSirius, are you there?\u201d\n\nHis voice echoed around the room, but there was no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he called, wondering whether it was just a mouse.\n\nKreacher the house-elf came creeping into view. He looked highly delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Potter boy\u2019s head in the fire,\u201d Kreacher informed the empty kitchen, stealing furtive, oddly triumphant glances at Harry. \u201cWhat has he come for, Kreacher wonders?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Sirius, Kreacher?\u201d Harry demanded.\n\nThe house-elf gave a wheezy chuckle. \u201cMaster has gone out, Harry Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s he gone? Where\u2019s he gone, Kreacher?\u201d\n\nKreacher merely cackled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you!\u201d said Harry, fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon Kreacher was almost nonexistent in this position. \u201cWhat about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of them, are any of them here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody here but Kreacher!\u201d said the elf gleefully, and turning away from Harry he began to walk slowly toward the door at the end of the kitchen. \u201cKreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his Mistress now, yes, he hasn\u2019t had a chance in a long time, Kreacher\u2019s Master has been keeping him away from her \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere has Sirius gone?\u201d Harry yelled after the elf. \u201cKreacher, has he gone to the Department of Mysteries?\u201d\n\nKreacher stopped in his tracks. Harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair legs before him.\n\n\u201cMaster does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going,\u201d said the elf quietly.\n\n\u201cBut you know!\u201d shouted Harry. \u201cDon\u2019t you? You know where he is!\u201d\n\nThere was a moment\u2019s silence, then the elf let out his loudest cackle yet. \u201cMaster will not come back from the Department of Mysteries!\u201d he said gleefully. \u201cKreacher and his Mistress are alone again!\u201d\n\nAnd he scurried forward and disappeared through the door to the hall.\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 !\u201d\n\nBut before he could utter a single curse or insult, Harry felt a great pain at the top of his head. He inhaled a lot of ash and, choking, found himself being dragged backward through the flames until, with a horrible abruptness, he was staring up into the wide, pallid face of Professor Umbridge, who had dragged him backward out of the fire by the hair and was now bending his neck back as far as it would go as though she was going to slit his throat.\n\n\u201cYou think,\u201d she whispered, bending Harry\u2019s neck back even farther, so that he was looking up at the ceiling above him, \u201cthat after two nifflers I was going to let one more foul, scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in, you foolish boy. Take his wand,\u201d she barked at someone he could not see, and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robes and remove the wand. \u201cHers too . . .\u201d\n\nHarry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that Hermione had just had her wand wrested from her as well.\n\n\u201cI want to know why you are in my office,\u201d said Umbridge, shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered.\n\n\u201cI was \u2014 trying to get my Firebolt!\u201d Harry croaked.\n\n\u201cLiar.\u201d She shook his head again. \u201cYour Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons, as you very well know, Potter. You had your head in my fire. With whom have you been communicating?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one \u2014\u201d said Harry, trying to pull away from her. He felt several hairs part company with his scalp.\n\n\u201cLiar!\u201d shouted Umbridge. She threw him from her, and he slammed into the desk. Now he could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode. Malfoy was leaning on the windowsill, smirking as he threw Harry\u2019s wand into the air one-handed and then caught it again.\n\nThere was a commotion outside and several large Slytherins entered, each gripping Ron, Ginny, Luna, and \u2014 to Harry\u2019s bewilderment \u2014 Neville, who was trapped in a stranglehold by Crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation. All four of them had been gagged.\n\n\u201cGot \u2019em all,\u201d said Warrington, shoving Ron roughly forward into the room. \u201cThat one,\u201d he poked a thick finger at Neville, \u201ctried to stop me taking her,\u201d he pointed at Ginny, who was trying to kick the shins of the large Slytherin girl holding her, \u201cso I brought him along too.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d said Umbridge, watching Ginny\u2019s struggles. \u201cWell, it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nMalfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically. Umbridge gave her wide, complacent smile and settled herself into a chintz-covered armchair, blinking up at her captives like a toad in a flowerbed.\n\n\u201cSo, Potter,\u201d she said. \u201cYou stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon,\u201d she nodded at Ron, and Malfoy laughed even louder, \u201cto tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mr. Filch having just informed me so.\n\n\u201cClearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone . . .\u201d\n\nMalfoy and a few of the other members of the Inquisitorial Squad laughed some more at that. Harry found he was so full of rage and hatred he was shaking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business who I talk to,\u201d he snarled.\n\nUmbridge\u2019s slack face seemed to tighten.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice. \u201cVery well, Mr. Potter . . . I offered you the chance to tell me freely. You refused. I have no alternative but to force you. Draco \u2014 fetch Professor Snape.\u201d\n\nMalfoy stowed Harry\u2019s wand inside his robes and left the room smirking, but Harry hardly noticed. He had just realized something; he could not believe he had been so stupid as to forget it. He had thought that all the members of the Order, all those who could help him save Sirius, were gone \u2014 but he had been wrong. There was still a member of the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts \u2014 Snape.\n\nThere was silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resultant from the Slytherins\u2019 efforts to keep Ron and the others under control. Ron\u2019s lip was bleeding onto Umbridge\u2019s carpet as he struggled against Warrington\u2019s half nelson. Ginny was still trying to stamp on the feet of the sixth-year girl who had both her upper arms in a tight grip. Neville was turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at Crabbe\u2019s arms, and Hermione was attempting vainly to throw Millicent Bulstrode off her. Luna, however, stood limply by the side of her captor, gazing vaguely out of the window as though rather bored by the proceedings.\n\nHarry looked back at Umbridge, who was watching him closely. He kept his face deliberately smooth and blank as footsteps were heard in the corridor outside and Draco Malfoy came back into the room, holding open the door for Snape.\n\n\u201cYou wanted to see me, Headmistress?\u201d said Snape, looking around at all the pairs of struggling students with an expression of complete indifference.\n\n\u201cAh, Professor Snape,\u201d said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up again. \u201cYes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as you can, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,\u201d he said, observing her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair. \u201cSurely you did not use it all? I told you that three drops would be sufficient.\u201d\n\nUmbridge flushed.\n\n\u201cYou can make some more, can\u2019t you?\u201d she said, her voice becoming more sweetly girlish as it always did when she was furious.\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Snape, his lip curling. \u201cIt takes a full moon cycle to mature, so I should have it ready for you in around a month.\u201d\n\n\u201cA month?\u201d squawked Umbridge, swelling toadishly. \u201cA month? But I need it this evening, Snape! I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown!\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Snape, showing his first, faint sign of interest as he looked around at Harry. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t surprise me. Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules.\u201d\n\nHis cold, dark eyes were boring into Harry\u2019s, who met his gaze unflinchingly, concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream, willing Snape to read it in his mind, to understand . . .\n\n\u201cI wish to interrogate him!\u201d shouted Umbridge angrily, and Snape looked away from Harry back into her furiously quivering face. \u201cI wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have already told you,\u201d said Snape smoothly, \u201cthat I have no further stocks of Veritaserum. Unless you wish to poison Potter \u2014 and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did \u2014 I cannot help you. The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for truth-telling . . .\u201d\n\nSnape looked back at Harry, who stared at him, frantic to communicate without words.\n\nVoldemort\u2019s got Sirius in the Department of Mysteries, he thought desperately. Voldemort\u2019s got Sirius \u2014\n\n\u201cYou are on probation!\u201d shrieked Professor Umbridge, and Snape looked back at her, his eyebrows slightly raised. \u201cYou are being deliberately unhelpful! I expected better, Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you! Now get out of my office!\u201d\n\nSnape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave. Harry knew his last chance of letting the Order know what was going on was walking out of the door.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got Padfoot!\u201d he shouted. \u201cHe\u2019s got Padfoot at the place where it\u2019s hidden!\u201d\n\nSnape had stopped with his hand on Umbridge\u2019s door handle.\n\n\u201cPadfoot?\u201d cried Professor Umbridge, looking eagerly from Harry to Snape. \u201cWhat is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What does he mean, Snape?\u201d\n\nSnape looked around at Harry. His face was inscrutable. Harry could not tell whether he had understood or not, but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of Umbridge.\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d said Snape coldly. \u201cPotter, when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage. And Crabbe, loosen your hold a little, if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork, and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job.\u201d\n\nHe closed the door behind him with a snap, leaving Harry in a state of worse turmoil than before: Snape had been his very last hope. He looked at Umbridge, who seemed to be feeling the same way; her chest was heaving with rage and frustration.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d she said, and she pulled out her wand. \u201cVery well . . . I am left with no alternative. . . . This is more than a matter of school discipline. . . . This is an issue of Ministry security. . . . Yes . . . yes . . .\u201d\n\nShe seemed to be talking herself into something. She was shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot, staring at Harry, beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily. Harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand as he watched her.\n\n\u201cYou are forcing me, Potter. . . . I do not want to,\u201d said Umbridge, still moving restlessly on the spot, \u201cbut sometimes circumstances justify the use . . . I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice . . .\u201d\n\nMalfoy was watching her with a hungry expression on his face.\n\n\u201cThe Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue,\u201d said Umbridge quietly.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d shrieked Hermione. \u201cProfessor Umbridge \u2014 it\u2019s illegal\u201d \u2014 but Umbridge took no notice. There was a nasty, eager, excited look on her face that Harry had never seen before. She raised her wand.\n\n\u201cThe Minister wouldn\u2019t want you to break the law, Professor Umbridge!\u201d cried Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat Cornelius doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him,\u201d said Umbridge, who was now panting slightly as she pointed her wand at different parts of Harry\u2019s body in turn, apparently trying to decide what would hurt the most. \u201cHe never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was you?\u201d gasped Harry. \u201cYou sent the dementors after me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody had to act,\u201d breathed Umbridge, as her wand came to rest pointing directly at Harry\u2019s forehead. \u201cThey were all bleating about silencing you somehow \u2014 discrediting you \u2014 but I was the one who actually did something about it . . . Only you wriggled out of that one, didn\u2019t you, Potter? Not today, though, not now . . .\u201d\n\nAnd taking a deep breath, she cried, \u201cCruc \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d shouted Hermione in a cracked voice from behind Millicent Bulstrode. \u201cNo \u2014 Harry \u2014 Harry, we\u2019ll have to tell her!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way!\u201d yelled Harry, staring at the little of Hermione he could see.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to, Harry, she\u2019ll force it out of you anyway, what\u2019s . . . what\u2019s the point . . . ?\u201d\n\nAnd Hermione began to cry weakly into the back of Millicent Bulstrode\u2019s robes. Millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well!\u201d said Umbridge, looking triumphant. \u201cLittle Miss Question-All is going to give us some answers! Come on then, girl, come on!\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 my \u2014 nee \u2014 no!\u201d shouted Ron through his gag.\n\nGinny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before; Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her too. But Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear. . . .\n\n\u201cI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sorry everyone,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cBut \u2014 I can\u2019t stand it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, girl!\u201d said Umbridge, seizing Hermione by the shoulders, thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her. \u201cNow then . . . with whom was Potter communicating just now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d gulped Hermione into her hands, \u201cwell, he was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore . . .\u201d\n\nRon froze, his eyes wide; Ginny stopped trying to stamp on her Slytherin captor\u2019s toes; even Luna looked mildly surprised. Fortunately, the attention of Umbridge and her minions was focused too exclusively upon Hermione to notice these suspicious signs.\n\n\u201cDumbledore?\u201d said Umbridge eagerly. \u201cYou know where Dumbledore is, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell . . . no!\u201d sobbed Hermione. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog\u2019s Head \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIdiot girl, Dumbledore won\u2019t be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry\u2019s looking for him!\u201d shouted Umbridge, disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 but we needed to tell him something important!\u201d wailed Hermione, holding her hands more tightly over her face, not, Harry knew, out of anguish, but to disguise the continued absence of tears.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d said Umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement. \u201cWhat was it you wanted to tell him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe . . . we wanted to tell him it\u2019s r-ready!\u201d choked Hermione.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s ready?\u201d demanded Umbridge, and now she grabbed Hermione\u2019s shoulders again and shook her slightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s ready, girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe . . . the weapon,\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cWeapon? Weapon?\u201d said Umbridge, and her eyes seemed to pop with excitement. \u201cYou have been developing some method of resistance? A weapon you could use against the Ministry? On Professor Dumbledore\u2019s orders, of course?\u201d\n\n\u201cY-y-yes,\u201d gasped Hermione. \u201cBut he had to leave before it was finished and n-n-now we\u2019ve finished it for him, and we c-c-can\u2019t find him t-t-to tell him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of weapon is it?\u201d said Umbridge harshly, her stubby hands still tight on Hermione\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t r-r-really understand it,\u201d said Hermione, sniffing loudly. \u201cWe j-j-just did what P-P-Professor Dumbledore told us t-t-to do . . .\u201d\n\nUmbridge straightened up, looking exultant.\n\n\u201cLead me to the weapon,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not showing . . . them,\u201d said Hermione shrilly, looking around at the Slytherins through her fingers.\n\n\u201cIt is not for you to set conditions,\u201d said Professor Umbridge harshly.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Hermione, now sobbing into her hands again, \u201cfine . . . let them see it, I hope they use it on you! In fact, I wish you\u2019d invite loads and loads of people to come and see! Th-that would serve you right \u2014 oh, I\u2019d love it if the wh-whole school knew where it was, and how to u-use it, and then if you annoy any of them they\u2019ll be able to s-sort you out!\u201d\n\nThese words had a powerful impact on Umbridge. She glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Malfoy, who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face.\n\nUmbridge contemplated Hermione for another long moment and then spoke in what she clearly thought was a motherly voice. \u201cAll right, dear, let\u2019s make it just you and me . . . and we\u2019ll take Potter too, shall we? Get up, now \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor,\u201d said Malfoy eagerly, \u201cProfessor Umbridge, I think some of the squad should come with you to look after \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?\u201d asked Umbridge sharply. \u201cIn any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these\u201d \u2014 she gestured around at Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna \u2014 \u201cescape.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Malfoy, looking sulky and disappointed.\n\n\u201cAnd you two can go ahead of me and show me the way,\u201d said Umbridge, pointing at Harry and Hermione with her wand. \u201cLead on . . .\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter33": "FIGHT AND FLIGHT\n\n\n\n\nHarry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even whether she had a plan. He walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge\u2019s office, knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going. He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing.\n\nHermione led the way down the stairs into the entrance hall. The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall. It seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world. . . .\n\nHermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling toward the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass, Umbridge jogging to keep up. Their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hidden in Hagrid\u2019s hut, is it?\u201d said Umbridge eagerly in Harry\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Hermione scathingly. \u201cHagrid might have set it off accidentally.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Umbridge, whose excitement seemed to be mounting. \u201cYes, he would have done, of course, the great half-breed oaf . . .\u201d\n\nShe laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing around and seize her by the throat, but resisted. His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill. . . .\n\n\u201cThen . . . where is it?\u201d asked Umbridge, with a hint of uncertainty in her voice as Hermione continued to stride toward the forest.\n\n\u201cIn there, of course,\u201d said Hermione, pointing into the dark trees. \u201cIt had to be somewhere that students weren\u2019t going to find it accidentally, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Umbridge, though she sounded a little apprehensive now. \u201cOf course . . . very well, then . . . you two stay ahead of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we have your wand, then, if we\u2019re going first?\u201d Harry asked her.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so, Mr. Potter,\u201d said Umbridge sweetly, poking him in the back with it. \u201cThe Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\nAs they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch Hermione\u2019s eye; walking into the forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening. She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge, with her shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up.\n\n\u201cIs it very far in?\u201d Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cYes, it\u2019s well hidden.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he had followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had not been with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 are you sure this is the right way?\u201d he asked her pointedly.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said in a steely voice, crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise. Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling. Neither of them paused to help her up again; Hermione merely strode on, calling loudly over her shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit further in!\u201d\n\n\u201cHermione, keep your voice down,\u201d Harry muttered, hurrying to catch up with her. \u201cAnything could be listening in here \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI want us heard,\u201d she answered quietly, as Umbridge jogged noisily after them. \u201cYou\u2019ll see . . .\u201d\n\nThey walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light. Harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes. . . .\n\n\u201cHow much further?\u201d demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him.\n\n\u201cNot far now!\u201d shouted Hermione, as they emerged into a dim, dank clearing. \u201cJust a little bit \u2014\u201d\n\nAn arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves. Harry could feel the forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield \u2014\n\nHe wrenched himself free of her and turned. Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at Harry, Hermione, and Umbridge, who backed slowly into the center of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror. Harry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant smile.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said a voice.\n\nHarry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian was walking toward them out of the circle; his bow, like the others\u2019, was raised. On Harry\u2019s right, Umbridge was still whimpering, her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur.\n\n\u201cI asked you who are you, human,\u201d said Magorian roughly.\n\n\u201cI am Dolores Umbridge!\u201d said Umbridge in a high-pitched, terrified voice. \u201cSenior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are from the Ministry of Magic?\u201d said Magorian, as many of the centaurs in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d said Umbridge in an even higher voice. \u201cSo be very careful! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, any attack by half-breeds such as yourselves on a human \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you call us?\u201d shouted a wild-looking black centaur, whom Harry recognized as Bane. There was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call them that!\u201d Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did not appear to have heard her. Still pointing her shaking wand at Magorian, she continued, \u201cLaw Fifteen B states clearly that \u2018Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence, and therefore considered responsible for its actions \u2014\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Near-human intelligence\u2019?\u201d repeated Magorian, as Bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground. \u201cWe consider that a great insult, human! Our intelligence, thankfully, far outstrips your own \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing in our forest?\u201d bellowed the hard-faced gray centaur whom Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the forest. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour forest?\u201d said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it seemed, with indignation. \u201cI would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land \u2014\u201d\n\nAn arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing. She let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hands over her head while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously. The sound of their wild, neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hooves was extremely unnerving.\n\n\u201cWhose forest is it now, human?\u201d bellowed Bane.\n\n\u201cFilthy half-breeds!\u201d she screamed, her hands still tight over her head. \u201cBeasts! Uncontrolled animals!\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet!\u201d shouted Hermione, but it was too late \u2014 Umbridge pointed her wand at Magorian and screamed, \u201cIncarcerous!\u201d\n\nRopes flew out of midair like thick snakes, wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur\u2019s torso and trapping his arms. He gave a cry of rage and reared onto his hind legs, attempting to free himself, while the other centaurs charged.\n\nHarry grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the ground. Facedown on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror as hooves thundered around him, but the centaurs leapt over and around them, bellowing and screaming with rage.\n\n\u201cNooooo!\u201d he heard Umbridge shriek. \u201cNoooooo . . . I am Senior Undersecretary . . . you cannot . . . unhand me, you animals . . . nooooo!\u201d\n\nHe saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to Stun one of them \u2014 then she screamed very loudly. Lifting his head a few inches, Harry saw that Umbridge had been seized from behind by Bane and lifted high into the air, wriggling and yelling with fright. Her wand fell from her hand to the ground and Harry\u2019s heart leapt, if he could just reach it \u2014\n\nBut as he stretched out a hand toward it, a centaur\u2019s hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half.\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d roared a voice in Harry\u2019s ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright; Hermione too had been pulled to her feet. Over the plunging, many-colored backs and heads of the centaurs Harry saw Umbridge being borne away through the trees by Bane, still screaming nonstop; her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hooves surrounding them.\n\n\u201cAnd these?\u201d said the hard-faced, gray centaur holding Hermione.\n\n\u201cThey are young,\u201d said a slow, doleful voice from behind Harry. \u201cWe do not attack foals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey brought her here, Ronan,\u201d replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on Harry. \u201cAnd they are not so young. . . . He is nearing manhood, this one . . .\u201d\n\nHe shook Harry by the neck of his robes.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said Hermione breathlessly, \u201cplease, don\u2019t attack us, we don\u2019t think like her, we aren\u2019t Ministry of Magic employees! We only came in here because we hoped you\u2019d drive her off for us \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry knew at once from the look on the face of the gray centaur holding Hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this. The gray centaur threw back his head, his back legs stamping furiously, and bellowed, \u201cYou see, Ronan? They already have the arrogance of their kind! So we were to do your dirty work, were we, human girl? We were to act as your servants, drive away your enemies like obedient hounds?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Hermione in a horrorstruck squeak. \u201cPlease \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean that! I just hoped you\u2019d be able to \u2014 to help us \u2014\u201d\n\nBut she seemed to be going from bad to worse.\n\n\u201cWe do not help humans!\u201d snarled the centaur holding Harry, tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time, so that Harry\u2019s feet left the ground momentarily. \u201cWe are a race apart and proud to be so. . . . We will not permit you to walk from here, boasting that we did your bidding!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to say anything like that!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cWe know you didn\u2019t do anything because we wanted you to \u2014\u201d\n\nBut nobody seemed to be listening to him. A bearded centaur toward the back of the crowd shouted, \u201cThey came here unasked, they must pay the consequences!\u201d\n\nA roar of approval met these words and a dun-colored centaur shouted, \u201cThey can join the woman!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t hurt the innocent!\u201d shouted Hermione, real tears sliding down her face now. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything to hurt you, we haven\u2019t used wands or threats, we just want to go back to school, please let us go back \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not all like the traitor Firenze, human girl!\u201d shouted the gray centaur, to more neighing roars of approval from his fellows. \u201cPerhaps you thought us pretty talking horses? We are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults! We do not recognize your laws, we do not acknowledge your superiority, we are \u2014\u201d\n\nBut they did not hear what else centaurs were, for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them \u2014 Harry, Hermione, and the fifty or so centaurs filling the clearing \u2014 looked around. Harry\u2019s centaur let him fall to the ground again as his hands flew to his bow and quiver of arrows; Hermione had been dropped too, and Harry hurried toward her as two thick tree trunks parted ominously and the monstrous form of Grawp the giant appeared in the gap.\n\nThe centaurs nearest him backed into those behind. The clearing was now a forest of bows and arrows waiting to be fired, all pointing upward at the enormous grayish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branches. Grawp\u2019s lopsided mouth was gaping stupidly. They could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the half-light, his dull sludge-colored eyes narrowed as he squinted down at the creatures at his feet. Broken ropes trailed from both ankles.\n\nHe opened his mouth even wider.\n\n\u201cHagger.\u201d\n\nHarry did not know what \u201chagger\u201d meant, or what language it was from, nor did he much care \u2014 he was watching Grawp\u2019s feet, which were almost as long as Harry\u2019s whole body. Hermione gripped his arm tightly; the centaurs were quite silent, staring up at the giant, whose huge, round head moved from side to side as he continued to peer amongst them as though looking for something he had dropped.\n\n\u201cHagger!\u201d he said again, more insistently.\n\n\u201cGet away from here, giant!\u201d called Magorian. \u201cYou are not welcome among us!\u201d\n\nThese words seemed to make no impression whatsoever on Grawp. He stooped a little (the centaurs\u2019 arms tensed on their bows) and then bellowed, \u201cHAGGER!\u201d\n\nA few of the centaurs looked worried now. Hermione, however, gave a gasp.\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d she whispered. \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to say \u2018Hagrid\u2019!\u201d\n\nAt this precise moment Grawp caught sight of them, the only two humans in a sea of centaurs. He lowered his head another foot or so, staring intently at them. Harry could feel Hermione shaking as Grawp opened his mouth wide again and said, in a deep, rumbling voice, \u201cHermy.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodness,\u201d said Hermione, gripping Harry\u2019s arm so tightly it was growing numb and looking as though she was about to faint, \u201che \u2014 he remembered!\u201d\n\n\u201cHERMY!\u201d roared Grawp. \u201cWHERE HAGGER?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d squealed Hermione, terrified. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grawp, I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\n\u201cGRAWP WANT HAGGER!\u201d\n\nOne of the giant\u2019s massive hands swooped down upon them \u2014 Hermione let out a real scream, ran a few steps backward and fell over. Wandless, Harry braced himself to punch, kick, bite, or whatever else it took as the hand flew toward him and knocked a snow-white centaur off his legs.\n\nIt was what the centaurs had been waiting for \u2014 Grawp\u2019s outstretched fingers were a foot from Harry when fifty arrows went soaring through the air at the giant, peppering his enormous face, causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again, rubbing his face with his enormous hands, breaking off the arrow shafts but forcing the heads in still deeper.\n\nHe yelled and stamped his enormous feet and the centaurs scattered out of the way. Pebble-sized droplets of Grawp\u2019s blood showered Harry as he pulled Hermione to her feet and the pair of them ran as fast as they could for the shelter of the trees. Once there they looked back \u2014 Grawp was snatching blindly at the centaurs as blood ran all down his face; they were retreating in disorder, galloping away through the trees on the other side of the clearing. As Harry and Hermione watched, Grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged after them, smashing more trees aside as he went.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Hermione, quaking so badly that her knees gave way. \u201cOh, that was horrible. And he might kill them all . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that fussed, to be honest,\u201d said Harry bitterly.\n\nThe sounds of the galloping centaurs and the blundering giant were growing fainter and fainter. As Harry listened to them his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him.\n\nThey had wasted so much time \u2014 they were even further from rescuing Sirius than they had been when he had had the vision. Not only had Harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the Forbidden Forest with no means of transport whatsoever.\n\n\u201cSmart plan,\u201d he spat at Hermione, keen to release some of his fury. \u201cReally smart plan. Where do we go from here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to get back up to the castle,\u201d said Hermione faintly.\n\n\u201cBy the time we\u2019ve done that, Sirius\u2019ll probably be dead!\u201d said Harry, kicking a nearby tree in temper; there was a high-pitched chattering overhead and he looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing its long twiglike fingers at him.\n\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t do anything without wands,\u201d said Hermione hopelessly, dragging herself up again. \u201cAnyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we were just wondering that,\u201d said a familiar voice from behind her.\n\nHarry and Hermione moved instinctively together, peering through the trees, as Ron came into sight, with Ginny, Neville, and Luna hurrying along behind him. All of them looked a little the worse for wear \u2014 there were several long scratches running the length of Ginny\u2019s cheek, a large purple lump was swelling above Neville\u2019s right eye, Ron\u2019s lip was bleeding worse than ever \u2014 but all were looking rather pleased with themselves.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Ron, pushing aside a low-hanging branch and holding out Harry\u2019s wand, \u201chad any ideas?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get away?\u201d asked Harry in amazement, taking his wand from Ron.\n\n\u201cCouple of Stunners, a Disarming Charm, Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx,\u201d said Ron airily, now handing back Hermione\u2019s wand too. \u201cBut Ginny was best, she got Malfoy \u2014 Bat-Bogey Hex \u2014 it was superb, his whole face was covered in the great flapping things. Anyway, we saw you heading into the forest out of the window and followed. What\u2019ve you done with Umbridge?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe got carried away,\u201d said Harry. \u201cBy a herd of centaurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they left you behind?\u201d asked Ginny, looking astonished.\n\n\u201cNo, they got chased off by Grawp,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Grawp?\u201d Luna asked interestedly.\n\n\u201cHagrid\u2019s little brother,\u201d said Ron promptly. \u201cAnyway, never mind that now. Harry, what did you find out in the fire? Has You-Know-Who got Sirius or \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, as his scar gave another painful prickle, \u201cand I\u2019m sure Sirius is still alive, but I can\u2019t see how we\u2019re going to get there to help him.\u201d\n\nThey all fell silent, looking rather scared. The problem facing them seemed insurmountable.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to fly, won\u2019t we?\u201d said Luna in the closest thing to a matter-of-fact voice Harry had ever heard her use.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry irritably, rounding on her, \u201cfirst of all, \u2018we\u2019 aren\u2019t doing anything if you\u2019re including yourself in that, and second of all, Ron\u2019s the only one with a broomstick that isn\u2019t being guarded by a security troll, so \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a broom!\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re not coming,\u201d said Ron angrily.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do!\u201d said Ginny, her jaw set so that her resemblance to Fred and George was suddenly striking.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too \u2014\u201d Harry began.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m three years older than you were when you fought You-Know-Who over the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone,\u201d she said fiercely, \u201cand it\u2019s because of me Malfoy\u2019s stuck back in Umbridge\u2019s office with giant flying bogeys attacking him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were all in the D.A. together,\u201d said Neville quietly. \u201cIt was all supposed to be about fighting You-Know-Who, wasn\u2019t it? And this is the first chance we\u2019ve had to do something real \u2014 or was that all just a game or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 of course it wasn\u2019t \u2014\u201d said Harry impatiently.\n\n\u201cThen we should come too,\u201d said Neville simply. \u201cWe want to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Luna, smiling happily.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes met Ron\u2019s. He knew that Ron was thinking exactly what he was: If he could have chosen any members of the D.A. in addition to himself, Ron, and Hermione to join him in the attempt to rescue Sirius, he would not have picked Ginny, Neville, or Luna.\n\n\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway,\u201d said Harry frustratedly, \u201cbecause we still don\u2019t know how to get there \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought we\u2019d settled that?\u201d said Luna maddeningly. \u201cWe\u2019re flying!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d said Ron, barely containing his anger, \u201cyou might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us can\u2019t sprout wings whenever we \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are other ways of flying than with broomsticks,\u201d said Luna serenely.\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose we\u2019re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is?\u201d Ron demanded.\n\n\u201cThe Crumple-Horned Snorkack can\u2019t fly,\u201d said Luna in a dignified voice, \u201cbut they can, and Hagrid says they\u2019re very good at finding places their riders are looking for.\u201d\n\nHarry whirled around. Standing between two trees, their white eyes gleaming eerily, were two thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d he whispered, moving toward them. They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one\u2019s shining neck. How could he ever have thought them ugly?\n\n\u201cIs it those mad horse things?\u201d said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the thestral Harry was patting. \u201cThose ones you can\u2019t see unless you\u2019ve watched someone snuff it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we need three,\u201d said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.\n\n\u201cFour, Hermione,\u201d said Ginny, scowling.\n\n\u201cI think there are six of us, actually,\u201d said Luna calmly, counting.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, we can\u2019t all go!\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cLook, you three\u201d \u2014 he pointed at Neville, Ginny, and Luna \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re not involved in this, you\u2019re not \u2014\u201d\n\nThey burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful, twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have time to argue.\n\n\u201cOkay, fine, it\u2019s your choice,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cBut unless we can find more thestrals you\u2019re not going to be able \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, more of them will come,\u201d said Ginny confidently, who like Ron was squinting in quite the wrong direction, apparently under the impression that she was looking at the horses.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood,\u201d she said coolly, \u201cand we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat, so that\u2019s probably why these two turned up in the first place . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp\u2019s blood.\n\n\u201cOkay, then,\u201d he said, a bright idea occurring. \u201cRon and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she\u2019ll attract more thestrals \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not staying behind!\u201d said Hermione furiously.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d said Luna, smiling. \u201cLook, here come more now. . . . You two must really smell . . .\u201d\n\nHarry turned. No fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking their way through the trees now, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He had no excuse now. . . .\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said angrily, \u201cpick one and get on, then.\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter34": "THE DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES\n\n\n\n\nHarry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily onto the horse\u2019s silken back. It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.\n\nHe found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure and looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature\u2019s back. Luna was already in place, sitting sidesaddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, however, were still standing motionless on the spot, openmouthed and staring.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re we supposed to get on?\u201d said Ron faintly. \u201cWhen we can\u2019t see the things?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s easy,\u201d said Luna, sliding obligingly from her thestral and marching over to him, Hermione, and Ginny. \u201cCome here . . .\u201d\n\nShe pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them onto the backs of their mounts. All three looked extremely nervous as she wound their hands into the horses\u2019 manes and told them to grip tightly before getting back onto her own steed.\n\n\u201cThis is mad,\u201d Ron said faintly, moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horse\u2019s neck. \u201cMad . . . if I could just see it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better hope it stays invisible,\u201d said Harry darkly. \u201cWe all ready, then?\u201d\n\nThey all nodded and he saw five pairs of knees tighten beneath their robes.\n\n\u201cOkay . . .\u201d\n\nHe looked down at the back of his thestral\u2019s glossy black head and swallowed. \u201cMinistry of Magic, visitors\u2019 entrance, London, then,\u201d he said uncertainly. \u201cEr . . . if you know . . . where to go . . .\u201d\n\nFor a moment his thestral did nothing at all. Then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended, the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backward over its bony rump. He closed his eyes and put his face down into the horse\u2019s silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a bloodred sunset.\n\nHarry did not think he had ever moved so fast: The thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating. The cooling air was slapping Harry\u2019s face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, he looked around and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their thestral to protect themselves from its slipstream.\n\nThey were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade. Harry could see mountains and gullies below them. In the falling darkness Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills. . . .\n\n\u201cThis is bizarre!\u201d Harry heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support. . . .\n\nTwilight fell: The sky turned to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon it was only the lights of Muggle towns that gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very fast they were traveling. Harry\u2019s arms were wrapped tightly around his horse\u2019s neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor? How much longer would he be able to resist Voldemort? All Harry knew for sure was that Sirius had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would cause him to feel Voldemort\u2019s jubilation or fury course through his own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr. Weasley was attacked. . . .\n\nOn they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry\u2019s face felt stiff and cold, his legs numb from gripping the thestral\u2019s sides so tightly, but he did not dare shift positions lest he slip. . . . He was deaf from the thundering in his ears and his mouth was dry and frozen from the rush of cold night air. He had lost all sense of how far they had come; all his faith was in the beast below him, still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onward. . . .\n\nIf they were too late . . .\n\nHe\u2019s still alive, he\u2019s still fighting, I can feel it. . . .\n\nIf Voldemort decided Sirius was not going to crack . . .\n\nI\u2019d know. . . .\n\nHarry\u2019s stomach gave a jolt. The thestral\u2019s head was suddenly pointing toward the ground and he had actually slid forward a few inches along its neck. They were descending at last. . . . He heard one of the girls shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see no sign of a falling body. . . . Presumably they had received a shock from the change of position, just as he had. . . .\n\nAnd now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides. They could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow that were windows. Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling toward the pavement. Harry gripped the thestral with every last ounce of his strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from his back, looking around at the street where the overflowing dumpster still stood a short way from the vandalized telephone box, both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the streetlights.\n\nRon landed a short way away and toppled immediately off his thestral onto the pavement.\n\n\u201cNever again,\u201d he said, struggling to his feet. He made as though to stride away from his thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again. \u201cNever, ever again . . . that was the worst \u2014\u201d\n\nHermione and Ginny touched down on either side of him. Both slid off their mounts a little more gracefully than Ron, though with similar expressions of relief at being back on firm ground. Neville jumped down, shaking, but Luna dismounted smoothly.\n\n\u201cWhere do we go from here, then?\u201d she asked Harry in a politely interested voice, as though this was all a rather interesting day-trip.\n\n\u201cOver here,\u201d he said. He gave his thestral a quick, grateful pat, then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door. \u201cCome on!\u201d he urged the others as they hesitated.\n\nRon and Ginny marched in obediently; Hermione, Neville, and Luna squashed themselves in after them; Harry took one glance back at the thestrals, now foraging for scraps of rotten food inside the dumpster, then forced himself into the box after Luna.\n\n\u201cWhoever\u2019s nearest the receiver, dial six two four four two!\u201d he said.\n\nRon did it, his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial. As it whirred back into place the cool female voice sounded inside the box, \u201cWelcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,\u201d Harry said very quickly, \u201cGinny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood . . . We\u2019re here to save someone, unless your Ministry can do it first!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said the cool female voice. \u201cVisitors, please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes.\u201d\n\nHalf a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny\u2019s head; he glanced at the topmost one.\n\nHARRY POTTER\n\nRESCUE MISSION\n\n\n\n\u201cVisitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine!\u201d Harry said loudly, as his scar gave another throb. \u201cNow can we move?\u201d\n\nThe floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box. The scavenging thestrals were sliding out of sight, blackness closed over their heads, and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic.\n\nA chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies. Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions, peering through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed to be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by day. There were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls, but he saw as the lift slid smoothly to a halt that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,\u201d said the woman\u2019s voice.\n\nThe door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of it, followed by Neville and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur\u2019s arrow, the tip of the goblin\u2019s hat, and the house-elf\u2019s ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall, Harry in the lead, past the fountain, toward the desk where the security man who had weighed Harry\u2019s wand had sat and which was now deserted.\n\nHarry felt sure that there ought to be a security person there, sure that their absence was an ominous sign, and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts. He pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clanking, and they dashed inside. Harry stabbed the number nine button, the grilles closed with a bang, and the lift began to descend, jangling and rattling. Harry had not realized how noisy the lifts were on the day that he had come with Mr. Weasley \u2014 he was sure that the din would raise every security person within the building, yet when the lift halted, the cool female voice said, \u201cDepartment of Mysteries,\u201d and the grilles slid open again, they stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of air from the lift.\n\nHarry turned toward the plain black door. After months and months of dreaming about it, he was here at last. . . .\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he whispered, and he led the way down the corridor, Luna right behind him, gazing around with her mouth slightly open.\n\n\u201cOkay, listen,\u201d said Harry, stopping again within six feet of the door. \u201cMaybe . . . maybe a couple of people should stay here as a \u2014 as a lookout, and \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how\u2019re we going to let you know something\u2019s coming?\u201d asked Ginny, her eyebrows raised. \u201cYou could be miles away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming with you, Harry,\u201d said Neville.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get on with it,\u201d said Ron firmly.\n\nHarry still did not want to take them all with him, but it seemed he had no choice. He turned to face the door and walked forward. Just as it had in his dream, it swung open and he marched forward, leading the others over the threshold.\n\nThey were standing in a large, circular room. Everything in here was black including the floor and ceiling \u2014 identical, unmarked, handle-less black doors were set at intervals all around the black walls, interspersed with branches of candles whose flames burned blue, their cool, shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor so that it looked as though there was dark water underfoot.\n\n\u201cSomeone shut the door,\u201d Harry muttered.\n\nHe regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it. Without the long chink of light from the torch-lit corridor behind them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor below.\n\nIn his dream, Harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on. But there were around a dozen doors here. Just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him, trying to decide which was the right one, there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways. The circular wall was rotating.\n\nHermione grabbed Harry\u2019s arm as though frightened the floor might move too, but it did not. For a few seconds the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around and then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again.\n\nHarry\u2019s eyes had blue streaks burned into them; it was all he could see.\n\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d whispered Ron fearfully.\n\n\u201cI think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in from,\u201d said Ginny in a hushed voice.\n\nHarry realized at once that she was right: He could no sooner have picked the exit from the other doors than located an ant upon the jet-black floor. Meanwhile, the door through which they needed to proceed could be any of the dozen surrounding them.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re we going to get back out?\u201d said Neville uncomfortably.\n\n\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d said Harry forcefully, blinking to try and erase the blue lines from his vision, and clutching his wand tighter than ever. \u201cWe won\u2019t need to get out till we\u2019ve found Sirius \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go calling for him, though!\u201d Hermione said urgently, but Harry had never needed her advice less; his instinct was to keep as quiet as possible for the time being.\n\n\u201cWhere do we go, then, Harry?\u201d Ron asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014\u201d Harry began. He swallowed. \u201cIn the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room \u2014 that\u2019s this one \u2014 and then I went through another door into a room that kind of . . . glitters. We should try a few doors,\u201d he said hastily. \u201cI\u2019ll know the right way when I see it. C\u2019mon.\u201d\n\nHe marched straight at the door now facing him, the others following close behind him, set his left hand against its cool, shining surface, raised his wand, ready to strike the moment it opened, and pushed. It swung open easily.\n\nAfter the darkness of the first room, the lamps hanging low on golden chains from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room was much brighter, though there were no glittering, shimmering lights such as Harry had seen in his dreams. The place was quite empty except for a few desks and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep-green water, big enough for all of them to swim in, which contained a number of pearly white objects that were drifting around lazily in the liquid.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re those things?\u201d whispered Ron.\n\n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cAre they fish?\u201d breathed Ginny.\n\n\u201cAquavirius maggots!\u201d said Luna excitedly. \u201cDad said the Ministry were breeding \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Hermione. She sounded odd. She moved forward to look through the side of the tank. \u201cThey\u2019re brains.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrains?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes . . . I wonder what they\u2019re doing with them?\u201d\n\nHarry joined her at the tank. Sure enough, there could be no mistake now that he saw them at close quarters. Glimmering eerily they drifted in and out of sight in the depths of the green water, looking something like slimy cauliflowers.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right, we need to try another door \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are doors here too,\u201d said Ron, pointing around the walls. Harry\u2019s heart sank; how big was this place?\n\n\u201cIn my dream I went through that dark room into the second one,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we should go back and try from there.\u201d\n\nSo they hurried back into the dark, circular room; the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before Harry\u2019s eyes instead of the blue candle flames.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d said Hermione sharply, as Luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them. \u201cFlagrate!\u201d\n\nShe drew with her wand in midair and a fiery X appeared on the door. No sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there was a great rumbling, and once again the wall began to revolve very fast, but now there was a great red-gold blur in amongst the faint blue, and when all became still again, the fiery cross still burned, showing the door they had already tried.\n\n\u201cGood thinking,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s try this one \u2014\u201d\n\nAgain he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open, his wand still raised, the others at his heels.\n\nThis room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the center of it was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet below them. They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheater, or the courtroom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot. Instead of a chained chair, however, there was a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor, and upon this dais stood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked, and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing. Unsupported by any surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which, despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air, was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d said Harry, jumping down onto the bench below. There was no answering voice, but the veil continued to flutter and sway.\n\n\u201cCareful!\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\nHarry scrambled down the benches one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked slowly toward the dais. The pointed archway looked much taller from where he stood now than when he had been looking down on it from above. Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had just passed through it.\n\n\u201cSirius?\u201d Harry spoke again, but much more quietly now that he was nearer.\n\nHe had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway. Gripping his wand very tightly, he edged around the dais, but there was nobody there. All that could be seen was the other side of the tattered black veil.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right, Harry, come on, let\u2019s go . . .\u201d\n\nShe sounded scared, much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it, old though it was. The gently rippling veil intrigued him; he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it.\n\n\u201cHarry, let\u2019s go, okay?\u201d said Hermione more forcefully.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, but he did not move. He had just heard something. There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil.\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d he said very loudly, so that the words echoed all around the surrounding stone benches.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s talking, Harry!\u201d said Hermione, now moving over to him.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s whispering behind there,\u201d he said, moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil. \u201cIs that you, Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here, mate,\u201d said Ron, appearing around the side of the archway.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t anyone else hear it?\u201d Harry demanded, for the whispering and murmuring was becoming louder; without really meaning to put it there, he found his foot was on the dais.\n\n\u201cI can hear them too,\u201d breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil. \u201cThere are people in there!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018in there\u2019?\u201d demanded Hermione, jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any \u2018in there,\u2019 it\u2019s just an archway, there\u2019s no room for anybody to be there \u2014 Harry, stop it, come away \u2014\u201d\n\nShe grabbed his arm and pulled, but he resisted.\n\n\u201cHarry, we are supposed to be here for Sirius!\u201d she said in a high-pitched, strained voice.\n\n\u201cSirius,\u201d Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerized, at the continuously swaying veil. \u201cYeah . . .\u201d\n\nAnd then something slid back into place in his brain: Sirius, captured, bound, and tortured, and he was staring at this archway. . . .\n\nHe took several paces back from the dais and wrenched his eyes from the veil.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to \u2014 well, come on, then!\u201d said Hermione, and she led the way back around the dais. On the other side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil too. Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginny\u2019s arm, Ron Neville\u2019s, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon that arch was?\u201d Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular room.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,\u201d she said firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door.\n\nOnce more the wall spun and became still again. Harry approached a door at random and pushed. It did not move.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d said Hermione.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . locked . . .\u201d said Harry, throwing his weight at the door, but it did not budge.\n\n\u201cThis is it, then, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Ron excitedly, joining Harry in the attempt to force the door open. \u201cBound to be!\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d said Hermione sharply. She pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said, \u201cAlohomora!\u201d\n\nNothing happened.\n\n\u201cSirius\u2019s knife!\u201d said Harry, and he pulled it out from inside his robes and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall. The others all watched eagerly as he ran it from top to bottom, withdrew it, and then flung his shoulder again at the door. It remained as firmly shut as ever. What was more, when Harry looked down at the knife, he saw that the blade had melted.\n\n\u201cRight, we\u2019re leaving that room,\u201d said Hermione decisively.\n\n\u201cBut what if that\u2019s the one?\u201d said Ron, staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream,\u201d said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius\u2019s knife in his pocket.\n\n\u201cYou know what could be in there?\u201d said Luna eagerly, as the wall started to spin yet again.\n\n\u201cSomething blibbering, no doubt,\u201d said Hermione under her breath, and Neville gave a nervous little laugh.\n\nThe wall slid back to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing desperation, pushed the next door open.\n\n\u201cThis is it!\u201d\n\nHe knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling light. As Harry\u2019s eyes became more accustomed to the brilliant glare he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfather and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching footsteps. The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room.\n\n\u201cThis way!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track. He led the way forward down the narrow space between the lines of the desks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering wind.\n\n\u201cOh look!\u201d said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very heart of the bell jar.\n\nDrifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-bright egg. As it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on the draft, its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.\n\n\u201cKeep going!\u201d said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg\u2019s progress back into a bird.\n\n\u201cYou dawdled enough by that old arch!\u201d she said crossly, but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d Harry said again, and his heart was now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech. \u201cIt\u2019s through here \u2014\u201d\n\nHe glanced around at them all. They had their wands out and looked suddenly serious and anxious. He looked back at the door and pushed. It swung open.\n\nThey were there, they had found the place: high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs. They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle brackets set at intervals along the shelves. Like those in the circular room behind them, their flames were burning blue. The room was very cold.\n\nHarry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves. He could not hear anything nor see the slightest sign of movement.\n\n\u201cYou said it was row ninety-seven,\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row. Beneath the branch of blue-glowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure 53.\n\n\u201cWe need to go right, I think,\u201d whispered Hermione, squinting to the next row. \u201cYes . . . that\u2019s fifty-four. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your wands out,\u201d Harry said softly.\n\nThey crept forward, staring behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves, the farther ends of which were in near total darkness. Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelf. Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and dark within as blown lightbulbs.\n\nThey passed row eighty-four . . . eighty-five . . . Harry was listening hard for the slightest sound of movement, but Sirius might be gagged now, or else unconscious . . . or, said an unbidden voice inside his head, he might already be dead. . . .\n\nI\u2019d have felt it, he told himself, his heart now hammering against his Adam\u2019s apple. I\u2019d already know. . . .\n\n\u201cNinety-seven!\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\nThey stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the alley beside it. There was nobody there.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right down at the end,\u201d said Harry, whose mouth had become slightly dry. \u201cYou can\u2019t see properly from here . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he led them forward, between the towering rows of glass balls, some of which glowed softly as they passed. . . .\n\n\u201cHe should be near here,\u201d whispered Harry, convinced that every step was going to bring the ragged form of Sirius into view upon the darkened floor. \u201cAnywhere here . . . really close . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d said Hermione tentatively, but he did not want to respond. His mouth was very dry now.\n\n\u201cSomewhere about . . . here . . .\u201d he said.\n\nThey had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight. There was nobody there at all. All was echoing, dusty silence.\n\n\u201cHe might be . . .\u201d Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the alley next door. \u201cOr maybe . . .\u201d He hurried to look down the one beyond that.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d said Hermione again.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he snarled.\n\n\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t think Sirius is here.\u201d\n\nNobody spoke. Harry did not want to look at any of them. He felt sick. He did not understand why Sirius was not here. He had to be here. This was where he, Harry, had seen him. . . .\n\nHe ran up the space at the end of the rows, staring down them. Empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past. He ran the other way, back past his staring companions. There was no sign of Sirius anywhere, nor any hint of a struggle.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d Ron called.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHe did not want to hear what Ron had to say, did not want to hear Ron tell him he had been stupid, or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts. But the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others\u2019 accusing stares. . . .\n\n\u201cHave you seen this?\u201d said Ron.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry, but eagerly this time \u2014 it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there, a clue \u2014 he strode back to where they were all standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelves.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry repeated glumly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s got your name on,\u201d said Ron.\n\nHarry moved a little closer. Ron was pointing at one of the small glass spheres that glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years.\n\n\u201cMy name?\u201d said Harry blankly.\n\nHe stepped forward. Not as tall as Ron, he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball. In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously, and below that:\n\nS. P. T. to A. P. W. B. D.\n\nDark Lord\n\nand (?) Harry Potter\n\n\n\nHarry stared at it.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ron asked, sounding unnerved. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name doing down here?\u201d\n\nHe glanced along at the other labels on that stretch of shelf.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here,\u201d he said, sounding perplexed. \u201cNone of the rest of us are here . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, I don\u2019t think you should touch it,\u201d said Hermione sharply, as he stretched out his hand.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something to do with me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Harry,\u201d said Neville suddenly. Harry looked around at him. Neville\u2019s round face was shining slightly with sweat. He looked as though he could not take much more suspense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got my name on,\u201d said Harry.\n\nAnd feeling slightly reckless, he closed his fingers around the dusty ball\u2019s surface. He had expected it to feel cold, but it did not. On the contrary, it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours, as though the glow of light within was warming it. Expecting, even hoping, that something dramatic was going to happen, something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worthwhile after all, he lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it.\n\nNothing whatsoever happened. The others moved in closer around Harry, gazing at the orb as he brushed it free of the clogging dust.\n\nAnd then, from right behind them, a drawling voice said, \u201cVery good, Potter. Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me.\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter35": "BEYOND THE VEIL\n\n\n\n\nBlack shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand-tips were pointing directly at their hearts. Ginny gave a gasp of horror.\n\n\u201cTo me, Potter,\u201d repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up.\n\nHarry\u2019s insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped and outnumbered two to one.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d said Malfoy yet again.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Sirius?\u201d Harry said.\n\nSeveral of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry\u2019s left said triumphantly, \u201cThe Dark Lord always knows!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d echoed Malfoy softly. \u201cNow, give me the prophecy, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know where Sirius is!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know where Sirius is!\u201d mimicked the woman to his left.\n\nShe and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got him,\u201d said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. \u201cHe\u2019s here. I know he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,\u201d said the woman in a horrible, mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNot yet \u2014\u201d\n\nThe woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter.\n\n\u201cYou hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,\u201d said Malfoy softly. \u201cHe has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know Sirius is here,\u201d said Harry, though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got him!\u201d\n\nMore of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman still laughed loudest of all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,\u201d said Malfoy. \u201cNow give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on, then,\u201d said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry\u2019s stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all. . . .\n\nBut the Death Eaters did not strike.\n\n\u201cHand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,\u201d said Malfoy coolly.\n\nIt was Harry\u2019s turn to laugh.\n\n\u201cYeah, right!\u201d he said. \u201cI give you this \u2014 prophecy, is it? And you\u2019ll just let us skip off home, will you?\u201d\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked, \u201cAccio Proph \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry was just ready for her. He shouted \u201cProtego!\u201d before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it.\n\n\u201cOh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,\u201d she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. \u201cVery well, then \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI TOLD YOU, NO!\u201d Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. \u201cIf you smash it \u2014 !\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity . . .\n\nThe woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange\u2019s face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow.\n\n\u201cYou need more persuasion?\u201d she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly. \u201cVery well \u2014 take the smallest one,\u201d she ordered the Death Eaters beside her. \u201cLet him watch while we torture the little girl. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nHarry felt the others close in around Ginny. He stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,\u201d he told Bellatrix. \u201cI don\u2019t think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he?\u201d\n\nShe did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Harry, \u201cwhat kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway?\u201d\n\nHe could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville\u2019s arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking. He could feel one of the other\u2019s quickened breath on the back of his head. He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of prophecy?\u201d repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her face. \u201cYou jest, Harry Potter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNope, not jesting,\u201d said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape. \u201cHow come Voldemort wants it?\u201d\n\nSeveral of the Death Eaters let out low hisses.\n\n\u201cYou dare speak his name?\u201d whispered Bellatrix.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got no problem saying Vol \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Bellatrix shrieked. \u201cYou dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood\u2019s tongue, you dare \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you know he\u2019s a half-blood too?\u201d said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. \u201cVoldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle \u2014 or has he been telling you lot he\u2019s pureblood?\u201d\n\n\u201cSTUPEF \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d\n\nA jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange\u2019s wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered.\n\nTwo figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak. Their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix\u2019s shouts.\n\n\u201c. . . at the Solstice will come a new . . .\u201d said the figure of an old, bearded man.\n\n\u201cDO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe dared \u2014 he dares \u2014\u201d shrieked Bellatrix incoherently. \u201c\u2014 He stands there \u2014 filthy half-blood \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWAIT UNTIL WE\u2019VE GOT THE PROPHECY!\u201d bawled Malfoy.\n\n\u201c. . . and none will come after . . .\u201d said the figure of a young woman.\n\nThe two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me what\u2019s so special about this prophecy I\u2019m supposed to be handing over,\u201d he said, playing for time. He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else\u2019s.\n\n\u201cDo not play games with us, Potter,\u201d said Malfoy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing games,\u201d said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone\u2019s toes and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermione\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cDumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?\u201d said Malfoy sneeringly.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 what?\u201d said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan. \u201cWhat about my scar?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d whispered Hermione more urgently behind him.\n\n\u201cCan this be?\u201d said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, \u201cSmash shelves \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore never told you?\u201d Malfoy repeated. \u201cWell, this explains why you didn\u2019t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 when I say go \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 you didn\u2019t come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he?\u201d said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. \u201cSo he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. \u201cBecause the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout both of you, Potter, about both of you . . . Haven\u2019t you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?\u201d\n\nHarry stared into the slitted eyeholes through which Malfoy\u2019s gray eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry\u2019s parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand?\n\n\u201cSomeone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?\u201d he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust. \u201cAnd he\u2019s made me come and get it for him? Why couldn\u2019t he come and get it himself?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet it himself?\u201d shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter. \u201cThe Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?\u201d said Harry. \u201cLike he tried to get Sturgis to steal it \u2014 and Bode?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good, Potter, very good . . .\u201d said Malfoy slowly. \u201cBut the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNOW!\u201d yelled Harry.\n\nFive different voices behind him bellowed \u201cREDUCTO!\u201d Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor \u2014\n\n\u201cRUN!\u201d Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of Hermione\u2019s robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres \u2014\n\nHarry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout \u201cStupefy!\u201d and the hand released him at once.\n\nThey were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione\u2019s voice urging Neville on. The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them \u2014\n\n\u201cColloportus!\u201d gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise.\n\n\u201cWhere \u2014 where are the others?\u201d gasped Harry.\n\nHe had thought that Ron, Luna, and Ginny had been ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there.\n\n\u201cThey must have gone the wrong way!\u201d whispered Hermione, terror in her face.\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d whispered Neville.\n\nFootsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed. Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar: \u201cLeave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care for Nott\u2019s injuries as much as losing that prophecy \u2014 Jugson, come back here, we need to organize! We\u2019ll split into pairs and search, and don\u2019t forget, be gentle with Potter until we\u2019ve got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary \u2014 Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right \u2014 Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead \u2014 Macnair and Avery, through here \u2014 Rookwood, over there \u2014 Mulciber, come with me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot.\n\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,\u201d said Harry. \u201cLet\u2019s get away from this door . . .\u201d\n\nThey ran, quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, toward the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut.\n\n\u201cStand aside!\u201d said a rough voice. \u201cAlohomora!\u201d\n\nAs the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters\u2019 robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly.\n\n\u201cThey might\u2019ve run straight through to the hall,\u201d said the rough voice.\n\n\u201cCheck under the desks,\u201d said another.\n\nHarry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted, \u201cSTUPEFY!\u201d\n\nA jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry\u2019s spell and now pointed his own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim.\n\n\u201cAvada \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, \u201cEXPELLIARMUS!\u201d\n\nBoth Harry\u2019s and the Death Eater\u2019s wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck at what he had done.\n\n\u201cGet out of the way, Harry!\u201d yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage.\n\nHarry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted, \u201cSTUPEFY!\u201d\n\nThe jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater\u2019s shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses. The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered \u2014\n\nThe Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned \u2014 his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, \u201cSTUP \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSTUPEFY!\u201d screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind.\n\n\u201cAccio Wand!\u201d cried Hermione. Harry\u2019s wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, \u201cright, let\u2019s get out of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cLook out!\u201d said Neville, horrified, staring at the Death Eater\u2019s head in the bell jar.\n\nAll three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck. They were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man\u2019s head.\n\nIt was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull, his cheeks smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz. . . .\n\nA baby\u2019s head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin. . . .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said Hermione in an awestruck voice. \u201cTime . . .\u201d\n\nThe Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together again, it began to shrink back to babyhood once more. . . .\n\nThere was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream.\n\n\u201cRON?\u201d Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. \u201cGINNY? LUNA?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione screamed.\n\nThe Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby\u2019s head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hurt a baby!\u201d\n\nThere was no time to argue the point. Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d he said again, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them, they took off for the door that stood ajar at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway.\n\nThey had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward them. Veering left he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them.\n\n\u201cCollo \u2014\u201d began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, \u201cIMPEDIMENTA!\u201d\n\nHarry, Hermione, and Neville were all knocked backward off their feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view, Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry\u2019s head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react.\n\n\u201cWE\u2019VE GOT HIM!\u201d yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, \u201cIN AN OFFICE OFF \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSilencio!\u201d cried Hermione, and the man\u2019s voice was extinguished. He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow.\n\n\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, facedown onto the rug at Harry\u2019s feet, stiff as a board and unable to move at all.\n\n\u201cWell done, Ha \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of what looked like purple flame. It passed right across Hermione\u2019s chest; she gave a tiny \u201coh!\u201d as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where she lay motionless.\n\n\u201cHERMIONE!\u201d\n\nHarry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville\u2019s head as he emerged \u2014 his foot broke Neville\u2019s wand in two and connected with his face \u2014 Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts.\n\nDolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harry\u2019s hand, to himself, then at Hermione. Though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been clearer: Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her. . . .\n\n\u201cLike you won\u2019t kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway!\u201d said Harry.\n\nA whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly. He had one hand on Hermione\u2019s shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don\u2019t let her be dead, don\u2019t let her be dead, it\u2019s my fault if she\u2019s dead. . . .\n\n\u201cWhaddever you do, Harry,\u201d said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, \u201cdon\u2019d gib it to him!\u201d\n\nThen there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over his shoulder \u2014 the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him.\n\nHarry seized his chance: \u201cPETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\u201d\n\nThe spell hit Dolohov before he could block it, and he toppled forward across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch.\n\n\u201cHermione,\u201d Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again. \u201cHermione, wake up . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddid he do to her?\u201d said Neville, crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose.\n\n\u201cI dunno . . .\u201d\n\nNeville groped for Hermione\u2019s wrist.\n\n\u201cDat\u2019s a pulse, Harry, I\u2019b sure id is . . .\u201d\n\nSuch a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I dink so . . .\u201d\n\nThere was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sounds of more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby Death Eater in the next room.\n\n\u201cNeville, we\u2019re not far from the exit,\u201d Harry whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re right next to that circular room. . . . If we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I\u2019ll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift. . . . Then you could find someone. . . . Raise the alarm . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd whad are you going do do?\u201d said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to find the others,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019b going do find dem wid you,\u201d said Neville firmly.\n\n\u201cBut Hermione \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll dake her wid us,\u201d said Neville firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll carry her \u2014 you\u2019re bedder at fighding dem dan I ab \u2014\u201d\n\nHe stood up and seized one of Hermione\u2019s arms, glared at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione\u2019s limp form over Neville\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Harry, snatching up Hermione\u2019s wand from the floor and shoving it into Neville\u2019s hand, \u201cyou\u2019d better take this . . .\u201d\n\nNeville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly toward the door.\n\n\u201cMy gran\u2019s going do kill be,\u201d said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, \u201cdat was by dad\u2019s old wand . . .\u201d\n\nHarry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter, and repair itself on the wall behind them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never going to notice us,\u201d he whispered. \u201cC\u2019mon . . . keep close behind me . . .\u201d\n\nThey crept out of the office and back toward the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forward, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione\u2019s weight. The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them, and the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harry\u2019s head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart Harry saw that Hermione\u2019s fiery crosses had faded from the doors.\n\n\u201cSo which way d\u2019you reck \u2014 ?\u201d\n\nBut before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it.\n\n\u201cRon!\u201d croaked Harry, dashing toward them. \u201cGinny \u2014 are you all \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the front of Harry\u2019s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. \u201cThere you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You\u2019re all messed up . . .\u201d\n\nRon\u2019s face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry\u2019s robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow.\n\n\u201cGinny?\u201d Harry said fearfully. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\nBut Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle.\n\n\u201cI think her ankle\u2019s broken, I heard something crack,\u201d whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. \u201cFour of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, we saw Uranus up close!\u201d said Ron, still giggling feebly. \u201cGet it, Harry? We saw Uranus \u2014 ha ha ha \u2014\u201d\n\nA bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron\u2019s mouth and burst.\n\n\u201cAnyway, one of them grabbed Ginny\u2019s foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but . . .\u201d\n\nLuna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed.\n\n\u201cAnd what about Ron?\u201d said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry\u2019s robes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they hit him with,\u201d said Luna sadly, \u201cbut he\u2019s gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Ron, pulling Harry\u2019s ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, \u201cyou know who this girl is, Harry? She\u2019s Loony . . . Loony Lovegood . . . ha ha ha . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d said Harry firmly. \u201cLuna, can you help Ginny?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, putting an arm around Ginny\u2019s waist and pulling her up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only my ankle, I can do it myself!\u201d said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron\u2019s arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley\u2019s. He looked around: They had a one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time \u2014\n\nHe heaved Ron toward a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\n\u201cThere they are!\u201d she shrieked.\n\nStunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him, and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione. They were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix.\n\n\u201cColloportus!\u201d shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d said a man\u2019s voice. \u201cThere are other ways in \u2014 WE\u2019VE GOT THEM, THEY\u2019RE HERE!\u201d\n\nHarry spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first.\n\n\u201cLuna \u2014 Neville \u2014 help me!\u201d\n\nThe three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door.\n\n\u201cColloportus!\u201d\n\nThere were footsteps running along behind the doors; every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered. Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall \u2014 then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry, \u201cCollo \u2014 aaaaaaaaargh . . .\u201d\n\nHe turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione.\n\n\u201cGet Potter!\u201d shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy \u2014\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. \u201cHey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn\u2019t that weird, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cRon, get out of the way, get down \u2014\u201d\n\nBut Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank.\n\n\u201cHonest, Harry, they\u2019re brains \u2014 look \u2014 Accio Brain!\u201d\n\nThe scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film \u2014\n\n\u201cHa ha ha, Harry, look at it \u2014\u201d said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards. \u201cHarry, come and touch it, bet it\u2019s weird \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRON, NO!\u201d\n\nHarry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands.\n\nThe moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron\u2019s arms like ropes.\n\n\u201cHarry, look what\u2019s happen \u2014 no \u2014 no, I don\u2019t like it \u2014 no, stop \u2014 stop \u2014\u201d\n\nBut the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron\u2019s chest now. He tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cDiffindo!\u201d yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds.\n\n\u201cHarry, it\u2019ll suffocate him!\u201d screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor \u2014 then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater\u2019s wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious.\n\n\u201cSTUBEFY!\u201d shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione\u2019s wand at the oncoming Death Eaters. \u201cSTUBEFY, STUBEFY!\u201d\n\nBut nothing happened \u2014 one of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange sprinted right at him. Holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others.\n\nIt seemed to have worked. They streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come. Inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron \u2014 find some way of releasing him \u2014 he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish \u2014\n\nHe was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters\u2019 laughter. He looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench toward him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him. The prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sights. The back of his legs hit something solid; he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backward onto it.\n\nThe Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the full Body-Bind, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cPotter, your race is run,\u201d drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask. \u201cNow hand me the prophecy like a good boy . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLet \u2014 let the others go, and I\u2019ll give it to you!\u201d said Harry desperately.\n\nA few of the Death Eaters laughed.\n\n\u201cYou are not in a position to bargain, Potter,\u201d said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure. \u201cYou see, there are ten of us and only one of you . . . or hasn\u2019t Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dot alone!\u201d shouted a voice from above them. \u201cHe\u2019s still god be!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart sank. Neville was scrambling down the stone benches toward them, Hermione\u2019s wand held fast in his trembling hand.\n\n\u201cNeville \u2014 no \u2014 go back to Ron \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSTUBEFY!\u201d Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn, \u201cSTUBEFY! STUBE \u2014\u201d\n\nOne of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Longbottom, isn\u2019t it?\u201d sneered Lucius Malfoy. \u201cWell, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause. . . . Your death will not come as a great shock . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cLongbottom?\u201d repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face. \u201cWhy, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI DOE YOU HAB!\u201d roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captor\u2019s encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, \u201cSomeone Stun him!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. \u201cNo, let\u2019s see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents. . . . Unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDON\u2019D GIB ID DO DEM!\u201d roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor, her wand raised. \u201cDON\u2019D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!\u201d\n\nBellatrix raised her wand. \u201cCrucio!\u201d\n\nNeville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony.\n\n\u201cThat was just a taster!\u201d said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that Neville\u2019s screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned and gazed up at Harry. \u201cNow, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!\u201d\n\nHarry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out. Malfoy jumped forward to take it.\n\nThen, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley.\n\nMalfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Neville, trying to pull himself up.\n\n\u201cAnd Ron?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dink he\u2019s all right \u2014 he was still fighding the brain when I left \u2014\u201d\n\nThe stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville\u2019s hand had been seconds before. Both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor.\n\n\u201cGive it to me,\u201d growled a voice in his ear, \u201cgive me the prophecy \u2014\u201d\n\nThe man was pressing so tightly on Harry\u2019s windpipe that he could not breathe \u2014 through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix \u2014 nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. . . . He turned his wand backward toward the man\u2019s side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man\u2019s free hand was groping toward the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy \u2014\n\n\u201cAARGH!\u201d\n\nNeville had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione\u2019s wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater\u2019s mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, \u201cSTUPEFY!\u201d\n\nThe Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off. It was Macnair, Buckbeak\u2019s would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot.\n\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs. Then Harry\u2019s foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped \u2014 for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody\u2019s magic eye spinning away across the floor.\n\nIts owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee.\n\n\u201cTarantallegra!\u201d he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again. \u201cNow, Potter \u2014\u201d\n\nHe made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, \u201cProtego!\u201d\n\nHarry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville\u2019s jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell.\n\nDolohov raised his wand again. \u201cAccio Proph \u2014\u201d\n\nSirius hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder, and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry\u2019s fingers but he had managed to cling to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand tips \u2014\n\nDolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d Once again, Dolohov\u2019s arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backward, landing with a crash on his back.\n\n\u201cNice one!\u201d shouted Sirius, forcing Harry\u2019s head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew toward them. \u201cNow I want you to get out of \u2014\u201d\n\nThey both ducked again. A jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius; across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat, and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray.\n\n\u201cHarry, take the prophecy, grab Neville, and run!\u201d Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over Harry\u2019s head as he launched himself toward Neville \u2014\n\n\u201cCan you stand?\u201d he bellowed in Neville\u2019s ear, as Neville\u2019s legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably. \u201cPut your arm round my neck \u2014\u201d\n\nNeville did so \u2014 Harry heaved \u2014 Neville\u2019s legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them. Both fell backward, Neville\u2019s legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle\u2019s, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed.\n\n\u201cThe prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\u201d snarled Lucius Malfoy\u2019s voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy\u2019s wand pressing hard between his ribs.\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 get \u2014 off \u2014 me . . . Neville \u2014 catch it!\u201d\n\nHarry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, \u201cImpedimenta!\u201d\n\nMalfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them.\n\n\u201cHarry, round up the others and GO!\u201d\n\nHarry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps. Neville\u2019s legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight. Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step \u2014\n\nA spell hit the stone bench at Harry\u2019s heel. It crumbled away and he fell back to the step below: Neville sank onto the bench above, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into his pocket.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville\u2019s robes. \u201cJust try and push with your legs \u2014\u201d\n\nHe gave another stupendous heave and Neville\u2019s robes tore all along the left seam \u2014 the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it, one of Neville\u2019s floundering feet kicked it. It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness.\n\n\u201cHarry, I\u2019b sorry!\u201d cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder, \u201cI\u2019b so sorry, Harry, I didn\u2019d bean do \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d Harry shouted. \u201cJust try and stand, let\u2019s get out of \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDubbledore!\u201d said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cDUBBLEDORE!\u201d\n\nHarry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body \u2014 they were saved.\n\nDumbledore had already sped past Neville and Harry, who had no more thoughts of leaving, when the Death Eaters nearest realized Dumbledore was there, and yelled to the others. One of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore\u2019s spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line \u2014\n\nOnly one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix\u2019s jet of red light: He was laughing at her. \u201cCome on, you can do better than that!\u201d he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room.\n\nThe second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest.\n\nThe laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock.\n\nHarry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. Harry jumped to the ground, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore turned to the dais too.\n\nIt seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch. . . .\n\nAnd Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather\u2019s wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place.\n\nHarry heard Bellatrix Lestrange\u2019s triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing \u2014 Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second. . . .\n\nBut Sirius did not reappear.\n\n\u201cSIRIUS!\u201d Harry yelled, \u201cSIRIUS!\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s breath was coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out again. . . .\n\nBut as he sprinted toward the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do, Harry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGet him, save him, he\u2019s only just gone through!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late, Harry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can still reach him \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. . . .\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He\u2019s gone.\u201d"}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter36": "THE ONLY ONE HE EVER FEARED\n\n\n\n\nHe hasn\u2019t gone!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\nHe did not believe it, he would not believe it; still he fought Lupin with every bit of strength he had: Lupin did not understand, people hid behind that curtain, he had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room \u2014 Sirius was hiding, simply lurking out of sight \u2014\n\n\u201cSIRIUS!\u201d he bellowed, \u201cSIRIUS!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t come back, Harry,\u201d said Lupin, his voice breaking as he struggled to contain Harry. \u201cHe can\u2019t come back, because he\u2019s d \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHE \u2014 IS \u2014 NOT \u2014 DEAD!\u201d roared Harry. \u201cSIRIUS!\u201d\n\nThere was movement going on around them, pointless bustling, the flashes of more spells. To Harry it was meaningless noise, the deflected curses flying past them did not matter, nothing mattered except that Lupin stop pretending that Sirius, who was standing feet from them behind that old curtain, was not going to emerge at any moment, shaking back his dark hair and eager to reenter the battle \u2014\n\nLupin dragged Harry away from the dais, Harry still staring at the archway, angry at Sirius now for keeping him waiting \u2014\n\nBut some part of him realized, even as he fought to break free from Lupin, that Sirius had never kept him waiting before. . . . Sirius had risked everything, always, to see Harry, to help him. . . . If Sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when Harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it, the only possible explanation was that he could not come back. . . . That he really was . . .\n\nDumbledore had most of the remaining Death Eaters grouped in the middle of the room, seemingly immobilized by invisible ropes. Mad-Eye Moody had crawled across the room to where Tonks lay and was attempting to revive her. Behind the dais there were still flashes of light, grunts, and cries \u2014 Kingsley had run forward to continue Sirius\u2019s duel with Bellatrix.\n\n\u201cHarry?\u201d\n\nNeville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where Harry stood. Harry was no longer struggling against Lupin, who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless.\n\n\u201cHarry . . . I\u2019b really sorry . . .\u201d said Neville. His legs were still dancing uncontrollably. \u201cWas dat man \u2014 was Sirius Black a \u2014 a friend of yours?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Lupin quietly, and pointing his wand at Neville\u2019s legs he said, \u201cFinite.\u201d The spell was lifted. Neville\u2019s legs fell back onto the floor and remained still. Lupin\u2019s face was pale. \u201cLet\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s find the others. Where are they all, Neville?\u201d\n\nLupin turned away from the archway as he spoke. It sounded as though every word was causing him pain.\n\n\u201cDey\u2019re all back dere,\u201d said Neville. \u201cA brain addacked Ron bud I dink he\u2019s all righd \u2014 and Herbione\u2019s unconscious, bud we could feel a bulse \u2014\u201d\n\nThere was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais. Harry saw Kingsley, yelling in pain, hit the ground. Bellatrix Lestrange turned tail and ran as Dumbledore whipped around. He aimed a spell at her but she deflected it. She was halfway up the steps now \u2014\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 no!\u201d cried Lupin, but Harry had already ripped his arm from Lupin\u2019s slackened grip.\n\n\u201cSHE KILLED SIRIUS!\u201d bellowed Harry. \u201cSHE KILLED HIM \u2014 I\u2019LL KILL HER!\u201d\n\nAnd he was off, scrambling up the stone benches. People were shouting behind him but he did not care. The hem of Bellatrix\u2019s robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming. . . .\n\nShe aimed a curse over her shoulder. The tank rose into the air and tipped. Harry was deluged in the foul-smelling potion within. The brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long, colored tentacles, but he shouted, \u201cWingardium Leviosa!\u201d and they flew into the air away from him. Slipping and sliding he ran on toward the door. He leapt over Luna, who was groaning on the floor, past Ginny, who said, \u201cHarry \u2014 what \u2014 ?\u201d past Ron, who giggled feebly, and Hermione, who was still unconscious. He wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw Bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room \u2014 beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts.\n\nHe ran, but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls had begun to rotate again. Once more he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the exit?\u201d he shouted desperately, as the wall rumbled to a halt again. \u201cWhere\u2019s the way out?\u201d\n\nThe room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask. The door right behind him flew open, and the corridor toward the lifts stretched ahead of him, torch-lit and empty. He ran. . . .\n\nHe could hear a lift clattering ahead of him. He sprinted up the passageway, swung around the corner, and slammed his fist onto the button to call a second lift. It jangled and banged lower and lower; the grilles slid open and Harry dashed inside, now hammering the button marked Atrium. The doors slid shut and he was rising. . . .\n\nHe forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around. Bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall, but she looked back as he sprinted toward her, and aimed another spell at him. He dodged behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren; the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold gates at the other end of the Atrium so that they rang like bells. There were no more footsteps. She had stopped running. He crouched behind the statues, listening.\n\n\u201cCome out, come out, little Harry!\u201d she called in her mock-baby voice, which echoed off the polished wooden floors. \u201cWhat did you come after me for, then? I thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am!\u201d shouted Harry, and a score of ghostly Harrys seemed to chorus I am! I am! I am! all around the room.\n\n\u201cAaaaaah . . . did you love him, little baby Potter?\u201d\n\nHatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before. He flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed \u201cCrucio!\u201d\n\nBellatrix screamed. The spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had \u2014 she was already on her feet again, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again \u2014 her counterspell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor.\n\n\u201cNever used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?\u201d she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. \u201cYou need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain \u2014 to enjoy it \u2014 righteous anger won\u2019t hurt me for long \u2014 I\u2019ll show you how it is done, shall I? I\u2019ll give you a lesson \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry had been edging around the fountain on the other side. She screamed, \u201cCrucio!\u201d and he was forced to duck down again as the centaur\u2019s arm, holding its bow, spun off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cPotter, you cannot win against me!\u201d she cried. He could hear her moving to the right, trying to get a clear shot of him. He backed around the statue away from her, crouching behind the centaur\u2019s legs, his head level with the house-elf\u2019s. \u201cI was and am the Dark Lord\u2019s most loyal servant, I learned the Dark Arts from him, and I know spells of such power that you, pathetic little boy, can never hope to compete \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStupefy!\u201d yelled Harry. He had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain for him. She reacted so fast he barely had time to duck.\n\n\u201cProtego!\u201d\n\nThe jet of red light, his own Stunning Spell, bounced back at him. Harry scrambled back behind the fountain, and one of the goblin\u2019s ears went flying across the room.\n\n\u201cPotter, I am going to give you one chance!\u201d shouted Bellatrix. \u201cGive me the prophecy \u2014 roll it out toward me now \u2014 and I may spare your life!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to have to kill me, because it\u2019s gone!\u201d Harry roared \u2014 and as he shouted it, pain seared across his forehead. His scar was on fire again, and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage. \u201cAnd he knows!\u201d said Harry with a mad laugh to match Bellatrix\u2019s own. \u201cYour dear old mate Voldemort knows it\u2019s gone! He\u2019s not going to be happy with you, is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d she cried, and for the first time there was fear in her voice.\n\n\u201cThe prophecy smashed when I was trying to get Neville up the steps! What do you think Voldemort\u2019ll say about that, then?\u201d\n\nHis scar seared and burned. . . . The pain of it was making his eyes stream. . . .\n\n\u201cLIAR!\u201d she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger now. \u201cYOU\u2019VE GOT IT, POTTER, AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME \u2014 Accio Prophecy! ACCIO PROPHECY!\u201d\n\nHarry laughed again because he knew it would incense her, the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst. He waved his empty hand from behind the one-eared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him.\n\n\u201cNothing there!\u201d he shouted. \u201cNothing to summon! It smashed and nobody heard what it said, tell your boss that \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t true, you\u2019re lying \u2014 MASTER, I TRIED, I TRIED \u2014 DO NOT PUNISH ME \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath!\u201d yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible than ever. \u201cHe can\u2019t hear you from here!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t I, Potter?\u201d said a high, cold voice.\n\nHarry opened his eyes.\n\nTall, thin, and black-hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet, slit-pupiled eyes staring . . . Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen, quite unable to move.\n\n\u201cSo you smashed my prophecy?\u201d said Voldemort softly, staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes. \u201cNo, Bella, he is not lying. . . . I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind. . . . Months of preparation, months of effort . . . and my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus Black!\u201d sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at Voldemort\u2019s feet as he paced slowly nearer. \u201cMaster, you should know \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, Bella,\u201d said Voldemort dangerously. \u201cI shall deal with you in a moment. Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your sniveling apologies?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Master \u2014 he is here \u2014 he is below \u2014\u201d\n\nVoldemort paid no attention.\n\n\u201cI have nothing more to say to you, Potter,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!\u201d\n\nHarry had not even opened his mouth to resist. His mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor.\n\nBut the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry.\n\n\u201cWhat \u2014 ?\u201d said Voldemort, staring around. And then he breathed, \u201cDumbledore!\u201d\n\nHarry looked behind him, his heart pounding. Dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates.\n\nVoldemort raised his wand and sent another jet of green light at Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak; next second he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand toward the remnants of the fountain; the other statues sprang to life too. The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest, before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor. Meanwhile, the goblin and the house-elf scuttled toward the fireplaces set along the wall, and the one-armed centaur galloped at Voldemort, who vanished and reappeared beside the pool. The headless statue thrust Harry backward, away from the fight, as Dumbledore advanced on Voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both.\n\n\u201cIt was foolish to come here tonight, Tom,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cThe Aurors are on their way \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBy which time I shall be gone, and you dead!\u201d spat Voldemort. He sent another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guard\u2019s desk, which burst into flame.\n\nDumbledore flicked his own wand. The force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his stone guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed, and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. The spell, whatever it was, caused no visible damage to the shield, though a deep, gonglike note reverberated from it, an oddly chilling sound. . . .\n\n\u201cYou do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore?\u201d called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. \u201cAbove such brutality, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe both know that there are other ways of destroying a man, Tom,\u201d Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk toward Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall. \u201cMerely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!\u201d snarled Voldemort.\n\n\u201cYou are quite wrong,\u201d said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks. Harry felt scared to see him walking along, undefended, shieldless. He wanted to cry out a warning, but his headless guard kept shunting him backward toward the wall, blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it. \u201cIndeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness \u2014\u201d\n\nAnother jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip. A long thin flame flew from the tip; it wrapped itself around Voldemort, shield and all. For a moment, it seemed Dumbledore had won, but then the fiery rope became a serpent, which relinquished its hold upon Voldemort at once and turned, hissing furiously, to face Dumbledore.\n\nVoldemort vanished. The snake reared from the floor, ready to strike \u2014\n\nThere was a burst of flame in midair above Dumbledore just as Voldemort reappeared, standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood.\n\n\u201cLook out!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\nBut even as he shouted, one more jet of green light had flown at Dumbledore from Voldemort\u2019s wand and the snake had struck \u2014\n\nFawkes swooped down in front of Dumbledore, opened his beak wide, and swallowed the jet of green light whole. He burst into flame and fell to the floor, small, wrinkled, and flightless. At the same moment, Dumbledore brandished his wand in one, long, fluid movement \u2014 the snake, which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him, flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke; the water in the pool rose up and covered Voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass \u2014\n\nFor a few seconds Voldemort was visible only as a dark, rippling, faceless figure, shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth, clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass \u2014\n\nThen he was gone, and the water fell with a crash back into its pool, slopping wildly over the sides, drenching the polished floor.\n\n\u201cMASTER!\u201d screamed Bellatrix.\n\nSure it was over, sure Voldemort had decided to flee, Harry made to run out from behind his statue guard, but Dumbledore bellowed, \u201cStay where you are, Harry!\u201d\n\nFor the first time, Dumbledore sounded frightened. Harry could not see why. The hall was quite empty but for themselves, the sobbing Bellatrix still trapped under her statue, and the tiny baby Fawkes croaking feebly on the floor \u2014\n\nAnd then Harry\u2019s scar burst open. He knew he was dead: it was pain beyond imagining, pain past endurance \u2014\n\nHe was gone from the hall, he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes, so tightly bound that Harry did not know where his body ended and the creature\u2019s began. They were fused together, bound by pain, and there was no escape \u2014\n\nAnd when the creature spoke, it used Harry\u2019s mouth, so that in his agony he felt his jaw move. . . .\n\n\u201cKill me now, Dumbledore . . .\u201d\n\nBlinded and dying, every part of him screaming for release, Harry felt the creature use him again. . . .\n\n\u201cIf death is nothing, Dumbledore, kill the boy . . .\u201d\n\nLet the pain stop, thought Harry. Let him kill us. . . . End it, Dumbledore. . . . Death is nothing compared to this. . . .\n\nAnd I\u2019ll see Sirius again. . . .\n\nAnd as Harry\u2019s heart filled with emotion, the creature\u2019s coils loosened, the pain was gone, Harry was lying facedown on the floor, his glasses gone, shivering as though he lay upon ice, not wood. . . .\n\nAnd there were voices echoing through the hall, more voices than there should have been: Harry opened his eyes, saw his glasses lying at the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him, but which now lay flat on its back, cracked and immobile. He put them on and raised his head an inch to find Dumbledore\u2019s crooked nose inches from his own.\n\n\u201cAre you all right, Harry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m \u2014 where\u2019s Voldemort, where \u2014 who are all these \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\nThe Atrium was full of people. The floor was reflecting emerald-green flames that had burst into life in all the fireplaces along one wall, and a stream of witches and wizards was emerging from them. As Dumbledore pulled him back to his feet, Harry saw the tiny gold statues of the house-elf and the goblin leading a stunned-looking Cornelius Fudge forward.\n\n\u201cHe was there!\u201d shouted a scarlet-robed man with a ponytail, who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall, where Bellatrix had lain trapped moments before. \u201cI saw him, Mr. Fudge, I swear, it was You-Know-Who, he grabbed a woman and Disapparated!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!\u201d gibbered Fudge, who was wearing pajamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles. \u201cMerlin\u2019s beard \u2014 here \u2014 here! \u2014 in the Ministry of Magic! \u2014 great heavens above \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem possible \u2014 my word \u2014 how can this be?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries, Cornelius,\u201d said Dumbledore, apparently satisfied that Harry was all right, and walking forward so that the newcomers realized he was there for the first time (a few of them raised their wands, others simply looked amazed; the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and Fudge jumped so much that his slipper-clad feet left the floor), \u201cyou will find several escaped Death Eaters contained in the Death Chamber, bound by an Anti-Disapparation Jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDumbledore!\u201d gasped Fudge, apparently beside himself with amazement. \u201cYou \u2014 here \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014\u201d\n\nHe looked wildly around at the Aurors he had brought with him, and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry, \u201cSeize him!\u201d\n\n\u201cCornelius, I am ready to fight your men \u2014 and win again!\u201d said Dumbledore in a thunderous voice. \u201cBut a few minutes ago you saw proof, with your own eyes, that I have been telling you the truth for a year. Lord Voldemort has returned, you have been chasing the wrong men for twelve months, and it is time you listened to sense!\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 well \u2014\u201d blustered Fudge, looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do. When nobody did, he said, \u201cVery well \u2014 Dawlish! Williamson! Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see . . . Dumbledore, you \u2014 you will need to tell me exactly \u2014 the Fountain of Magical Brethren \u2014 what happened?\u201d he added in a kind of whimper, staring around at the floor, where the remains of the statues of the witch, wizard, and centaur now lay scattered.\n\n\u201cWe can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cHarry \u2014 Harry Potter?\u201d\n\nFudge spun around and stared at Harry, who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had been guarding him during Dumbledore and Voldemort\u2019s duel.\n\n\u201cHe-here?\u201d said Fudge. \u201cWhy \u2014 what\u2019s all this about?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall explain everything,\u201d repeated Dumbledore, \u201cwhen Harry is back at school.\u201d\n\nHe walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard\u2019s head lay on the floor. He pointed his wand at it and muttered, \u201cPortus.\u201d The head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds, then became still once more.\n\n\u201cNow see here, Dumbledore!\u201d said Fudge, as Dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to Harry carrying it. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got authorization for that Portkey! You can\u2019t do things like that right in front of the Minister of Magic, you \u2014 you \u2014\u201d\n\nHis voice faltered as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his half-moon spectacles.\n\n\u201cYou will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYou will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work. I will give you . . .\u201d Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and glanced at it, \u201chalf an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. Letters addressed to the headmaster will find me.\u201d\n\nFudge goggled worse than ever. His mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled gray hair.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 you \u2014\u201d\n\nDumbledore turned his back on him.\n\n\u201cTake this Portkey, Harry.\u201d\n\nHe held out the golden head of the statue, and Harry placed his hand upon it, past caring what he did next or where he went.\n\n\u201cI shall see you in half an hour,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cOne . . . two . . . three . . .\u201d\n\nHarry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel. The polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet; the Atrium, Fudge, and Dumbledore had all disappeared, and he was flying forward in a whirlwind of color and sound. . . ."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter37": "THE LOST PROPHECY\n\n\n\n\nHarry\u2019s feet hit solid ground again; his knees buckled a little and the golden wizard\u2019s head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor. He looked around and saw that he had arrived in Dumbledore\u2019s office.\n\nEverything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmaster\u2019s absence. The delicate silver instruments stood again upon the spindle-legged tables, puffing and whirring serenely. The portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames, heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of their pictures. Harry looked through the window. There was a cool line of pale green along the horizon: Dawn was approaching.\n\nThe silence and the stillness, broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait, was unbearable to him. If his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him, the pictures would have been screaming in pain. He walked around the quiet, beautiful office, breathing quickly, trying not to think. But he had to think. . . . There was no escape. . . .\n\nIt was his fault Sirius had died; it was all his fault. If he, Harry, had not been stupid enough to fall for Voldemort\u2019s trick, if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real, if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that Voldemort was, as Hermione had said, banking on Harry\u2019s love of playing the hero . . .\n\nIt was unbearable, he would not think about it, he could not stand it. . . . There was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine, a dark hole where Sirius had been, where Sirius had vanished. He did not want to have to be alone with that great, silent space, he could not stand it \u2014\n\nA picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore, and a cool voice said, \u201cAh . . . Harry Potter . . .\u201d\n\nPhineas Nigellus gave a long yawn, stretching his arms as he watched Harry with shrewd, narrow eyes.\n\n\u201cAnd what brings you here in the early hours of the morning?\u201d said Phineas. \u201cThis office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don\u2019t tell me . . .\u201d He gave another shuddering yawn. \u201cAnother message for my worthless great-great-grandson?\u201d\n\nHarry could not speak. Phineas Nigellus did not know that Sirius was dead, but Harry could not tell him. To say it aloud would be to make it final, absolute, irretrievable.\n\nA few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob.\n\nIt would not turn. He was shut in.\n\n\u201cI hope this means,\u201d said the corpulent, red-nosed wizard who hung on the wall behind Dumbledore\u2019s desk, \u201cthat Dumbledore will soon be back with us?\u201d\n\nHarry turned. The wizard was eyeing him with great interest. Harry nodded. He tugged again on the doorknob behind his back, but it remained immovable.\n\n\u201cOh good,\u201d said the wizard. \u201cIt has been very dull without him, very dull indeed.\u201d\n\nHe settled himself on the thronelike chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon Harry.\n\n\u201cDumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know,\u201d he said comfortably. \u201cOh yes. Holds you in great esteem.\u201d\n\nThe guilt filling the whole of Harry\u2019s chest like some monstrous, weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed. Harry could not stand this, he could not stand being Harry anymore. . . . He had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body, never wished so intensely that he could be somebody \u2014 anybody \u2014 else. . . .\n\nThe empty fireplace burst into emerald-green flame, making Harry leap away from the door, staring at the man spinning inside the grate. As Dumbledore\u2019s tall form unfolded itself from the fire, the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake. Many of them gave cries of welcome.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Dumbledore softly.\n\nHe did not look at Harry at first, but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew, from an inside pocket of his robes, the tiny, ugly, featherless Fawkes, whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the full-grown Fawkes usually stood.\n\n\u201cWell, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore, finally turning away from the baby bird, \u201cyou will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night\u2019s events.\u201d\n\nHarry tried to say \u201cGood,\u201d but no sound came out. It seemed to him that Dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused by his actions tonight, and although Dumbledore was for once looking at him directly, and though his expression was kindly rather than accusatory, Harry could not bear to meet his eyes.\n\n\u201cMadam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cNymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. Mungo\u2019s, but it seems that she will make a full recovery.\u201d\n\nHarry contented himself with nodding at the carpet, which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler. He was sure that all the portraits around the room were listening eagerly to every word Dumbledore spoke, wondering where Dumbledore and Harry had been and why there had been injuries.\n\n\u201cI know how you are feeling, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore very quietly.\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d said Harry, and his voice was suddenly loud and strong. White-hot anger leapt inside him. Dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings.\n\n\u201cYou see, Dumbledore?\u201d said Phineas Nigellus slyly. \u201cNever try to understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Phineas,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nHarry turned his back on Dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the opposite window. He could see the Quidditch stadium in the distance. Sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy black dog, so he could watch Harry play. . . . He had probably come to see whether Harry was as good as James had been. . . . Harry had never asked him. . . .\n\n\u201cThere is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore\u2019s voice. \u201cOn the contrary . . . the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.\u201d\n\nHarry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling him with the desire to hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words.\n\n\u201cMy greatest strength, is it?\u201d said Harry, his voice shaking as he stared out at the Quidditch stadium, no longer seeing it. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a clue. . . . You don\u2019t know . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat don\u2019t I know?\u201d asked Dumbledore calmly.\n\nIt was too much. Harry turned around, shaking with rage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about how I feel, all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! This pain is part of being human \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTHEN \u2014 I \u2014 DON\u2019T \u2014 WANT \u2014 TO \u2014 BE \u2014 HUMAN!\u201d Harry roared, and he seized one of the delicate silver instruments from the spindle-legged table beside him and flung it across the room. It shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. Several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright, and the portrait of Armando Dippet said, \u201cReally!\u201d\n\n\u201cI DON\u2019T CARE!\u201d Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace. \u201cI\u2019VE HAD ENOUGH, I\u2019VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON\u2019T CARE ANYMORE \u2014\u201d\n\nHe seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that too. It broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions.\n\n\u201cYou do care,\u201d said Dumbledore. He had not flinched or made a single move to stop Harry demolishing his office. His expression was calm, almost detached. \u201cYou care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI \u2014 DON\u2019T!\u201d Harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat might tear, and for a second he wanted to rush at Dumbledore and break him too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside Harry.\n\n\u201cOh yes, you do,\u201d said Dumbledore, still more calmly. \u201cYou have now lost your mother, your father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known. Of course you care.\u201d\n\n\u201cYOU DON\u2019T KNOW HOW I FEEL!\u201d Harry roared. \u201cYOU \u2014 STANDING THERE \u2014 YOU \u2014\u201d\n\nBut words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more help. He wanted to run, he wanted to keep running and never look back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him, that hatefully calm old face. He ran to the door, seized the doorknob again, and wrenched at it.\n\nBut the door would not open.\n\nHarry turned back to Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cLet me out,\u201d he said. He was shaking from head to foot.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Dumbledore simply.\n\nFor a few seconds they stared at each other.\n\n\u201cLet me out,\u201d Harry said again.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dumbledore repeated.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t \u2014 if you keep me in here \u2014 if you don\u2019t let me \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBy all means continue destroying my possessions,\u201d said Dumbledore serenely. \u201cI daresay I have too many.\u201d\n\nHe walked around his desk and sat down behind it, watching Harry.\n\n\u201cLet me out,\u201d Harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore\u2019s.\n\n\u201cNot until I have had my say,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cDo you \u2014 do you think I want to \u2014 do you think I give a \u2014 I DON\u2019T CARE WHAT YOU\u2019VE GOT TO SAY!\u201d Harry roared. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear anything you\u2019ve got to say!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will,\u201d said Dumbledore sadly. \u201cBecause you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be. If you are to attack me, as I know you are close to doing, I would like to have thoroughly earned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my fault that Sirius died,\u201d said Dumbledore clearly. \u201cOr I should say almost entirely my fault \u2014 I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever, and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That blame lies with me, and with me alone.\u201d\n\nHarry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but he was unaware of it. He was gazing at Dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing.\n\n\u201cPlease sit down,\u201d said Dumbledore. It was not an order, it was a request.\n\nHarry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing Dumbledore\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cAm I to understand,\u201d said Phineas Nigellus slowly from Harry\u2019s left, \u201cthat my great-great-grandson \u2014 the last of the Blacks \u2014 is dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Phineas,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Phineas brusquely.\n\nHarry turned his head in time to see Phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in Grimmauld Place. He would walk, perhaps, from portrait to portrait, calling for Sirius through the house. . . .\n\n\u201cHarry, I owe you an explanation,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAn explanation of an old man\u2019s mistakes. For I see now that what I have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age. Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young . . . and I seem to have forgotten lately . . .\u201d\n\nThe sun was rising properly now. There was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colorless and bright. The light fell upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his face.\n\n\u201cI guessed, fifteen years ago,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwhen I saw the scar upon your forehead, what it might mean. I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve told me this before, Professor,\u201d said Harry bluntly. He did not care about being rude. He did not care about anything very much anymore.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore apologetically. \u201cYes, but you see \u2014 it is necessary to start with your scar. For it became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that I was correct, and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you, or else feeling powerful emotion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d said Harry wearily.\n\n\u201cAnd this ability of yours \u2014 to detect Voldemort\u2019s presence, even when he is disguised, and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused \u2014 has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers.\u201d\n\nHarry did not bother to nod. He knew all of this already.\n\n\u201cMore recently,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cI became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists. Sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence. I am speaking, of course, of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Snape told me,\u201d Harry muttered.\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape, Harry,\u201d Dumbledore corrected him quietly. \u201cBut did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you? Why I did not teach you Occlumency? Why I had not so much as looked at you for months?\u201d\n\nHarry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry mumbled. \u201cYeah, I wondered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d continued Dumbledore heavily, \u201cI believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he realized that our relationship was \u2014 or had ever been \u2014 closer than that of headmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might try and possess you. Harry, I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way. On those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes. . . . I was trying, in distancing myself from you, to protect you. An old man\u2019s mistake . . .\u201d\n\nHarry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him, ready to strike, on those occasions when he and Dumbledore made eye contact.\n\n\u201cVoldemort\u2019s aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, would not have been my destruction. It would have been yours. He hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while ago, that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him.\u201d\n\nHe sighed deeply. Harry was letting the words wash over him. He would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago, and now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of Sirius, none of it mattered . . .\n\n\u201cSirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley\u2019s attack. I knew at once that my worst fears were correct: Voldemort from that point had realized he could use you. In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort\u2019s assaults on your mind, I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.\u201d\n\nHe paused. Harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of Dumbledore\u2019s desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill. Harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to Dumbledore\u2019s explanation. He could hear the occasional rustle of robes, the slight clearing of a throat. Phineas Nigellus had still not returned. . . .\n\n\u201cProfessor Snape discovered,\u201d Dumbledore resumed, \u201cthat you had been dreaming about the door to the Department of Mysteries for months. Voldemort, of course, had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body, and as he dwelled on the door, so did you, though you did not know what it meant.\n\n\u201cAnd then you saw Rookwood, who worked in the Department of Mysteries before his arrest, telling Voldemort what we had known all along \u2014 that the prophecies held in the Ministry of Magic are heavily protected. Only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness. In this case, either Voldemort himself would have to enter the Ministry of Magic and risk revealing himself at last \u2014 or else you would have to take it for him. It became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master Occlumency.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d muttered Harry. He said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him; a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart. \u201cI didn\u2019t practice, I didn\u2019t bother, I could\u2019ve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had he\u2019d never have been able to show me where to go, and \u2014 Sirius wouldn\u2019t \u2014 Sirius wouldn\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\nSomething was erupting inside Harry\u2019s head: a need to justify himself, to explain \u2014\n\n\u201cI tried to check he\u2019d really taken Sirius, I went to Umbridge\u2019s office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and he said Sirius wasn\u2019t there, he said he\u2019d gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher lied,\u201d said Dumbledore calmly. \u201cYou are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe \u2014 he sent me on purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one master for months.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d said Harry blankly. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been out of Grimmauld Place for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cwhen Sirius, apparently, shouted at him to \u2018get out.\u2019 He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house. He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left. . . . Black\u2019s cousin Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d Harry said. His heart was beating very fast. He felt sick. He remembered worrying about Kreacher\u2019s odd absence over Christmas, remembered him turning up again in the attic. . . .\n\n\u201cKreacher told me last night,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYou see, when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic warning, he realized that you had had a vision of Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries. He, like you, attempted to contact Sirius at once. I should explain that members of the Order of the Phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge\u2019s office. Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive and safe in Grimmauld Place.\n\n\u201cWhen, however, you did not return from your trip into the forest with Dolores Umbridge, Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort\u2019s. He alerted certain Order members at once.\u201d\n\nDumbledore heaved a great sigh and then said, \u201cAlastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Remus Lupin were at headquarters when he made contact. All agreed to go to your aid at once. Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain behind, as he needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was due there at any moment. In the meantime he, Professor Snape, intended to search the forest for you.\n\n\u201cBut Sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you. He delegated to Kreacher the task of telling me what had happened. And so it was that when I arrived in Grimmauld Place shortly after they had all left for the Ministry, it was the elf who told me \u2014 laughing fit to burst \u2014 where Sirius had gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was laughing?\u201d said Harry in a hollow voice.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYou see, Kreacher was not able to betray us totally. He is not Secret-Keeper for the Order, he could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the Order\u2019s confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal. He was bound by the enchantments of his kind, which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master, Sirius. But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort, yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cLike the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly. \u201cLike the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother. Voldemort knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, that you knew where he was \u2014 but Kreacher\u2019s information made him realize that the one person whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s lips were cold and numb.\n\n\u201cSo . . . when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Malfoys \u2014 undoubtedly on Voldemort\u2019s instructions \u2014 had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured. Then, if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not, Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not. Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday, and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire, Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him.\u201d\n\nThere seemed to be very little air in Harry\u2019s lungs, his breathing was quick and shallow.\n\n\u201cAnd Kreacher told you all this . . . and laughed?\u201d he croaked.\n\n\u201cHe did not wish to tell me,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cBut I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I \u2014 persuaded him \u2014 to tell me the full story, before I left for the Department of Mysteries.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists on his knees, \u201cand Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was quite right, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect. I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us. I do not think that Sirius took me very seriously, or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human\u2019s \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you blame \u2014 don\u2019t you \u2014 talk \u2014 about Sirius like \u2014\u201d Harry\u2019s breath was constricted, he could not get the words out properly. But the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in him again; he would not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius. \u201cKreacher\u2019s a lying \u2014 foul \u2014 he deserved \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cKreacher is what he has been made by wizards, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cYes, he is to be pitied. His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby\u2019s. He was forced to do Sirius\u2019s bidding, because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved, but he felt no true loyalty to him. And whatever Kreacher\u2019s faults, it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher\u2019s lot easier \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDON\u2019T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT!\u201d Harry yelled.\n\nHe was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood Sirius at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered . . .\n\n\u201cWhat about Snape?\u201d Harry spat. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking about him, are you? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of Dolores Umbridge,\u201d said Dumbledore steadily, \u201cbut as I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as possible about what you had said. It was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest. It was he too who gave Professor Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell of Sirius\u2019s whereabouts . . .\u201d\n\nHarry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him.\n\n\u201cSnape \u2014 Snape g-goaded Sirius about staying in the house \u2014 he made out Sirius was a coward \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cSnape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons!\u201d Harry snarled. \u201cHe threw me out of his office!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am aware of it,\u201d said Dumbledore heavily. \u201cI have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSnape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him \u2014\u201d Harry remembered Ron\u2019s thoughts on the subject and plunged on. \u201cHow do you know he wasn\u2019t trying to soften me up for Voldemort, make it easier for him to get inside my \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI trust Severus Snape,\u201d said Dumbledore simply. \u201cBut I forgot \u2014 another old man\u2019s mistake \u2014 that some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father \u2014 I was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s okay, is it?\u201d yelled Harry, ignoring the scandalized faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits covering the walls. \u201cIt\u2019s okay for Snape to hate my dad, but it\u2019s not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher?\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius did not hate Kreacher,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHe regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . . The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.\u201d\n\n\u201cSO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?\u201d Harry yelled.\n\n\u201cI did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it,\u201d Dumbledore replied quietly. \u201cSirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he did hate it!\u201d said Harry, his voice cracking, turning his back on Dumbledore and walking away. The sun was bright inside the room now, and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked, without realizing what he was doing, without seeing the office at all. \u201cYou made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that\u2019s why he wanted to get out last night \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI was trying to keep Sirius alive,\u201d said Dumbledore quietly.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like being locked up!\u201d Harry said furiously, rounding on him. \u201cYou did it to me all last summer \u2014\u201d\n\nDumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered hands. Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften him. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when Harry wanted to rage and storm at him.\n\nDumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses.\n\n\u201cIt is time,\u201d he said, \u201cfor me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at me \u2014 to do whatever you like \u2014 when I have finished. I will not stop you.\u201d\n\nHarry glared at him for a moment, then flung himself back into the chair opposite Dumbledore and waited. Dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window, then looked back at Harry and said, \u201cFive years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well \u2014 not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle\u2019s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.\u201d\n\nHe paused. Harry said nothing.\n\n\u201cYou might ask \u2014 and with good reason \u2014 why it had to be so. Why could some Wizarding family not have taken you in? Many would have done so more than gladly, would have been honored and delighted to raise you as a son.\n\n\u201cMy answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters \u2014 and many of them are almost as terrible as he \u2014 were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead. Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you.\n\n\u201cI knew that Voldemort\u2019s knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power.\n\n\u201cBut I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated \u2014 to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother\u2019s blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t love me,\u201d said Harry at once. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t give a damn \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she took you,\u201d Dumbledore cut across him. \u201cShe may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother\u2019s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile you can still call home the place where your mother\u2019s blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWait a moment.\u201d\n\nHe sat up straighter in his chair, staring at Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cYou sent that Howler. You told her to remember \u2014 it was your voice \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought,\u201d said Dumbledore, inclining his head slightly, \u201cthat she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you. I suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cWell \u2014 my uncle more than her. He wanted to chuck me out, but after the Howler came she \u2014 she said I had to stay.\u201d He stared at the floor for a moment, then said, \u201cBut what\u2019s this got to do with . . .\u201d\n\nHe could not say Sirius\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, then,\u201d continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, \u201cyou arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. Thus far, my plan was working well.\n\n\u201cAnd then . . . well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you, and sooner \u2014 much sooner \u2014 than I had anticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort. You survived again. You did more. You delayed his return to full power and strength. You fought a man\u2019s fight. I was . . . prouder of you than I can say.\n\n\u201cYet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAn obvious flaw that I knew, even then, might be the undoing of it all. And yet, knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed, I told myself that I would not permit this flaw to ruin it. I alone could prevent this, so I alone must be strong. And here was my first test, as you lay in the hospital wing, weak from your struggle with Voldemort.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember asking me, as you lay in the hospital wing, why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby?\u201d\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\u201cOught I to have told you then?\u201d\n\nHarry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing, but his heart was racing again.\n\n\u201cYou do not see the flaw in the plan yet? No . . . perhaps not. Well, as you know, I decided not to answer you. Eleven, I told myself, was much too young to know. I had never intended to tell you when you were eleven. The knowledge would be too much at such a young age.\n\n\u201cI should have recognized the danger signs then. I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew, one day, I must give a terrible answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day. . . . You were too young, much too young.\n\n\u201cAnd so we entered your second year at Hogwarts. And once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced. Once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams. You did not ask me again, however, why Voldemort had left that mark upon you. We discussed your scar, oh yes. . . . We came very, very close to the subject. Why did I not tell you everything?\n\n\u201cWell, it seemed to me that twelve was, after all, hardly better than eleven to receive such information. I allowed you to leave my presence, bloodstained, exhausted but exhilarated, and if I felt a twinge of unease that I ought, perhaps, to have told you then, it was swiftly silenced. You were still so young, you see, and I could not find it in me to spoil that night of triumph. . . .\n\n\u201cDo you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI cared about you too much,\u201d said Dumbledore simply. \u201cI cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.\n\n\u201cIs there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have \u2014 and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined \u2014 not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hands.\n\n\u201cWe entered your third year. I watched from afar as you struggled to repel dementors, as you found Sirius, learned what he was and rescued him. Was I to tell you then, at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the Ministry? But now, at the age of thirteen, my excuses were running out. Young you might be, but you had proved you were exceptional. My conscience was uneasy, Harry. I knew the time must come soon. . . .\n\n\u201cBut you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself . . . and I did not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you before this. My only defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could not bring myself to add another \u2014 the greatest one of all.\u201d\n\nHarry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.\u201d\n\nThe sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore\u2019s office was bathed in it. The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes.\n\n\u201cThe prophecy\u2019s smashed,\u201d Harry said blankly. \u201cI was pulling Neville up those benches in the \u2014 the room where the archway was, and I ripped his robes and it fell . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries. But the prophecy was made to somebody, and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho heard it?\u201d asked Harry, though he thought he knew the answer already.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cOn a cold, wet night sixteen years ago, in a room above the bar at the Hog\u2019s Head Inn. I had gone there to see an applicant for the post of Divination teacher, though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of Divination to continue at all. The applicant, however, was the great-great-granddaughter of a very famous, very gifted Seer, and I thought it common politeness to meet her. I was disappointed. It seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself. I told her, courteously I hope, that I did not think she would be suitable for the post. I turned to leave.\u201d\n\nDumbledore got to his feet and walked past Harry to the black cabinet that stood beside Fawkes\u2019s perch. He bent down, slid back a catch, and took from inside it the shallow stone basin, carved with runes around the edges, in which Harry had seen his father tormenting Snape. Dumbledore walked back to the desk, placed the Pensieve upon it, and raised his wand to his own temple. From it, he withdrew silvery, gossamer-fine strands of thought clinging to the wand, and deposited them in the basin. He sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the Pensieve for a moment. Then, with a sigh, he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.\n\nA figure rose out of it, draped in shawls, her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses, and she revolved slowly, her feet in the basin. But when Sybill Trelawney spoke, it was not in her usual ethereal, mystic voice, but in the harsh, hoarse tones Harry had heard her use once before.\n\n\u201cTHE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD APPROACHES. . . . BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM, BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES . . . AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK HIM AS HIS EQUAL, BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS NOT . . . AND EITHER MUST DIE AT THE HAND OF THE OTHER FOR NEITHER CAN LIVE WHILE THE OTHER SURVIVES. . . . THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD WILL BE BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES . . .\u201d\n\nThe slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished.\n\nThe silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore nor Harry nor any of the portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had fallen silent.\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumbledore?\u201d Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still staring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. \u201cIt . . . did that mean . . . What did that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt meant,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cthat the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times.\u201d\n\nHarry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His breathing seemed difficult again.\n\n\u201cIt means \u2014 me?\u201d\n\nDumbledore took a deep breath.\n\n\u201cThe odd thing is, Harry,\u201d he said softly, \u201cthat it may not have meant you at all. Sybill\u2019s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe official record was relabeled after Voldemort\u2019s attack on you as a child,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cIt seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sybill was referring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen \u2014 it might not be me?\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d said Dumbledore slowly, looking as though every word cost him a great effort, \u201cthat there is no doubt that it is you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you said \u2014 Neville was born at the end of July too \u2014 and his mum and dad \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort. . . . Voldemort himself would \u2018mark him as his equal.\u2019 And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he might have chosen wrong!\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe might have marked the wrong person!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAnd notice this, Harry. He chose, not the pureblood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing), but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far \u2014 something that neither your parents, nor Neville\u2019s parents, ever achieved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did he do it, then?\u201d said Harry, who felt numb and cold. \u201cWhy did he try and kill me as a baby? He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat might, indeed, have been the more practical course,\u201d said Dumbledore, \u201cexcept that Voldemort\u2019s information about the prophecy was incomplete. The Hog\u2019s Head Inn, which Sybill chose for its cheapness, has long attracted, shall we say, a more interesting clientele than the Three Broomsticks. As you and your friends found out to your cost, and I to mine that night, it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard. Of course, I had not dreamed, when I set out to meet Sybill Trelawney, that I would hear anything worth overhearing. My \u2014 our \u2014 one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he only heard . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe heard only the first part, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you \u2014 again marking you as his equal. So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait or to learn more. He did not know that you would have \u2018power the Dark Lord knows not\u2019 \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t!\u201d said Harry in a strangled voice. \u201cI haven\u2019t any powers he hasn\u2019t got, I couldn\u2019t fight the way he did tonight, I can\u2019t possess people or \u2014 or kill them \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a room in the Department of Mysteries,\u201d interrupted Dumbledore, \u201cthat is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all. That power took you to save Sirius tonight. That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort, because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests. In the end, it mattered not that you could not close your mind. It was your heart that saved you.\u201d\n\nHarry closed his eyes. If he had not gone to save Sirius, Sirius would not have died. . . . More to stave off the moment when he would have to think of Sirius again, Harry asked, without caring much about the answer, \u201cThe end of the prophecy . . . it was something about . . . \u2018neither can live . . . \u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018 . . . while the other survives,\u2019\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d said Harry, dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him, \u201cso does that mean that . . . that one of us has got to kill the other one . . . in the end?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore.\n\nFor a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone forever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already, even if a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with his laugh like a bark. . . .\n\n\u201cI feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,\u201d said Dumbledore hesitantly. \u201cYou may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect? I must confess . . . that I rather thought . . . you had enough responsibility to be going on with.\u201d\n\nHarry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore\u2019s face into his long silver beard."}
{"5-Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix-chapter38": "THE SECOND WAR BEGINS\n\n\n\n\nHE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED RETURNS\n\nIn a brief statement Friday night, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge confirmed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned to this country and is active once more.\n\n\u201cIt is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling himself Lord \u2014 well, you know who I mean \u2014 is alive and among us again,\u201d said Fudge, looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters. \u201cIt is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of Azkaban, who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry\u2019s employ. We believe that the dementors are currently taking direction from Lord \u2014 Thingy.\n\n\u201cWe urge the magical population to remain vigilant. The Ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defense that will be delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the coming month.\u201d\n\nThe Minister\u2019s statement was met with dismay and alarm from the Wizarding community, which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was \u201cno truth whatsoever in these persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating amongst us once more.\u201d\n\nDetails of the events that led to the Ministry turnaround are still hazy, though it is believed that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and a select band of followers (known as Death Eaters) gained entry to the Ministry of Magic itself on Thursday evening.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore, newly reinstated headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, reinstated member of the International Confederation of Wizards, and reinstated Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, was unavailable for comment last night. He has insisted for a year that You-Know-Who was not dead, as was widely hoped and believed, but recruiting followers once more for a fresh attempt to seize power. Meanwhile the Boy Who Lived \u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere you are, Harry, I knew they\u2019d drag you into it somehow,\u201d said Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him.\n\nThey were in the hospital wing. Harry was sitting on the end of Ron\u2019s bed and they were both listening to Hermione read the front page of the Sunday Prophet. Ginny, whose ankle had been mended in a trice by Madam Pomfrey, was curled up at the foot of Hermione\u2019s bed; Neville, whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape, was in a chair between the two beds; and Luna, who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of The Quibbler, was reading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a word Hermione was saying.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s \u2018the Boy Who Lived\u2019 again now, though, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said Ron darkly. \u201cNot such a show-off maniac anymore, eh?\u201d\n\nHe helped himself to a handful of Chocolate Frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet, threw a few to Harry, Ginny, and Neville, and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth. There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain\u2019s tentacles had wrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly\u2019s Oblivious Unction, there seemed to be some improvement.\n\n\u201cYes, they\u2019re very complimentary about you now, Harry,\u201d said Hermione, now scanning down the article. \u201c\u2018A lone voice of truth . . . perceived as unbalanced, yet never wavered in his story . . . forced to bear ridicule and slander . . . \u2019 Hmmm,\u201d said Hermione, frowning, \u201cI notice they don\u2019t mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering, though . . .\u201d\n\nShe winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs. The curse Dolohov had used on her, though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud, had nevertheless caused, in Madam Pomfrey\u2019s words, \u201cquite enough damage to be going on with.\u201d Hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day and although she was improving greatly, was already bored with the hospital wing.\n\n\u201c\u2018You-Know-Who\u2019s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What the Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter, page nine . . .\u2019 Well,\u201d said Hermione, folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside, \u201cit\u2019s certainly given them lots to write about. And that interview with Harry isn\u2019t exclusive, it\u2019s the one that was in The Quibbler months ago . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cDaddy sold it to them,\u201d said Luna vaguely, turning a page of The Quibbler. \u201cHe got a very good price for it too, so we\u2019re going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack.\u201d\n\nHermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, then said, \u201cThat sounds lovely.\u201d\n\nGinny caught Harry\u2019s eye and looked away quickly, grinning.\n\n\u201cSo anyway,\u201d said Hermione, sitting up a little straighter and wincing again, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on in school?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Flitwick\u2019s got rid of Fred and George\u2019s swamp,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cHe did it in about three seconds. But he left a tiny patch under the window and he\u2019s roped it off \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said Hermione, looking startled.\n\n\u201cOh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic,\u201d said Ginny, shrugging.\n\n\u201cI think he left it as a monument to Fred and George,\u201d said Ron through a mouthful of chocolate. \u201cThey sent me all these, you know,\u201d he told Harry, pointing at the small mountain of Frogs beside him. \u201cMust be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?\u201d\n\nHermione looked rather disapproving and asked, \u201cSo has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore\u2019s back?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Neville, \u201ceverything\u2019s settled right back down again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI s\u2019pose Filch is happy, is he?\u201d asked Ron, propping a Chocolate Frog card featuring Dumbledore against his water jug.\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Ginny. \u201cHe\u2019s really, really miserable, actually . . .\u201d She lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cHe keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts . . .\u201d\n\nAll six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs. How he had done it \u2014 how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him \u2014 nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed.\n\n\u201cMadam Pomfrey says she\u2019s just in shock,\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cSulking, more like,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cYeah, she shows signs of life if you do this,\u201d said Ron, and with his tongue he made soft clip-clopping noises. Umbridge sat bolt upright, looking wildly around.\n\n\u201cAnything wrong, Professor?\u201d called Madam Pomfrey, poking her head around her office door.\n\n\u201cNo . . . no . . .\u201d said Umbridge, sinking back into her pillows, \u201cno, I must have been dreaming . . .\u201d\n\nHermione and Ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of centaurs,\u201d said Hermione, when she had recovered a little, \u201cwho\u2019s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthe other centaurs won\u2019t take him back, will they?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach,\u201d said Ginny.\n\n\u201cBet Dumbledore wishes he could\u2019ve got rid of Trelawney for good,\u201d said Ron, now munching on his fourteenth Frog. \u201cMind you, the whole subject\u2019s useless if you ask me, Firenze isn\u2019t a lot better . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Hermione demanded. \u201cAfter we\u2019ve just found out that there are real prophecies?\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione, or anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room, and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way. . . .\n\n\u201cIt is a pity it broke,\u201d said Hermione quietly, shaking her head.\n\n\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d said Ron. \u201cStill, at least You-Know-Who never found out what was in it either \u2014 where are you going?\u201d he added, looking both surprised and disappointed as Harry stood up.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 Hagrid\u2019s,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou know, he just got back and I promised I\u2019d go down and see him and tell him how you two are . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh all right then,\u201d said Ron grumpily, looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond. \u201cWish we could come . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSay hello to him for us!\u201d called Hermione, as Harry proceeded down the ward. \u201cAnd ask him what\u2019s happening about . . . about his little friend!\u201d\n\nHarry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory.\n\nThe castle seemed very quiet even for a Sunday. Everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds, enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by studying or homework. Harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor, peering out of windows as he went. He could see people messing around in the air over the Quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake, accompanied by the giant squid.\n\nHe was finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not. Whenever he was in company he wanted to get away, and whenever he was alone he wanted company. He thought he might really go and visit Hagrid, though; he had not talked to him properly since he had returned. . . .\n\nHarry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry stopped dead; so did Malfoy and the others. For a few moments, the only sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors.\n\nMalfoy glanced around. Harry knew he was checking for signs of teachers. Then he looked back at Harry and said in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019re dead, Potter.\u201d\n\nHarry raised his eyebrows. \u201cFunny,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019d think I\u2019d have stopped walking around . . .\u201d\n\nMalfoy looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him. He felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale, pointed face contorted with rage.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay,\u201d said Malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you pay for what you\u2019ve done to my father . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m terrified now,\u201d said Harry sarcastically. \u201cI s\u2019pose Lord Voldemort\u2019s just a warm-up act compared to you three \u2014 what\u2019s the matter?\u201d he said, for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name. \u201cHe\u2019s your dad\u2019s mate, isn\u2019t he? Not scared of him, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re such a big man, Potter,\u201d said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. \u201cYou wait. I\u2019ll have you. You can\u2019t land my father in prison \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I just had,\u201d said Harry.\n\n\u201cThe dementors have left Azkaban,\u201d said Malfoy quietly. \u201cDad and the others\u2019ll be out in no time . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I expect they will,\u201d said Harry. \u201cStill, at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now \u2014\u201d\n\nMalfoy\u2019s hand flew toward his wand, but Harry was too quick for him. He had drawn his own wand before Malfoy\u2019s fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes.\n\n\u201cPotter!\u201d\n\nThe voice rang across the entrance hall; Snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office, and at the sight of him Harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt toward Malfoy. . . . Whatever Dumbledore said, he would never forgive Snape . . . never . . .\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Potter?\u201d said Snape coldly as ever, as he strode over to the four of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,\u201d said Harry fiercely.\n\nSnape stared at him.\n\n\u201cPut that wand away at once,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cTen points from Gryff \u2014\u201d\n\nSnape looked toward the giant hourglasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile.\n\n\u201cAh. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hourglass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAdd some more?\u201d\n\nProfessor McGonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle. She was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other, but otherwise looked quite well.\n\n\u201cProfessor McGonagall!\u201d said Snape, striding forward. \u201cOut of St. Mungo\u2019s, I see!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Professor Snape,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off her traveling cloak, \u201cI\u2019m quite as good as new. You two \u2014 Crabbe \u2014 Goyle \u2014\u201d\n\nShe beckoned them forward imperiously and they came, shuffling their large feet and looking awkward.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, thrusting her carpetbag into Crabbe\u2019s chest and her cloak into Goyle\u2019s, \u201ctake these up to my office for me.\u201d\n\nThey turned and stumped away up the marble staircase.\n\n\u201cRight then,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, looking up at the hourglasses on the wall, \u201cwell, I think Potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-Know-Who! What say you, Professor Snape?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d snapped Snape, though Harry knew he had heard perfectly well. \u201cOh \u2014 well \u2014 I suppose . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s fifty each for Potter, the two Weasleys, Longbottom, and Miss Granger,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor\u2019s hourglass as she spoke. \u201cOh \u2014 and fifty for Miss Lovegood, I suppose,\u201d she added, and a number of sapphires fell into Ravenclaw\u2019s glass. \u201cNow, you wanted to take ten from Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape \u2014 so there we are . . .\u201d\n\nA few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless.\n\n\u201cWell, Potter, Malfoy, I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this,\u201d Professor McGonagall continued briskly.\n\nHarry did not need telling twice. He thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy.\n\nThe hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns toward Hagrid\u2019s cabin. Students lying around on the grass sunbathing, talking, reading the Sunday Prophet, and eating sweets looked up at him as he passed. Some called out to him, or else waved, clearly eager to show that they, like the Prophet, had decided he was something of a hero. Harry said nothing to any of them. He had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago, but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it that way.\n\nHe thought at first when he knocked on Hagrid\u2019s cabin door that he was out, but then Fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome. Hagrid, it transpired, was picking runner beans in his back garden.\n\n\u201cAll righ\u2019, Harry!\u201d he said, beaming, when Harry approached the fence. \u201cCome in, come in, we\u2019ll have a cup o\u2019 dandelion juice. . . .\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s things?\u201d Hagrid asked him, as they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice. \u201cYou \u2014 er \u2014 feelin\u2019 all righ\u2019, are yeh?\u201d\n\nHarry knew from the look of concern on Hagrid\u2019s face that he was not referring to Harry\u2019s physical well-being.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Harry said quickly, because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in Hagrid\u2019s mind. \u201cSo, where\u2019ve you been?\u201d\n\n\u201cBin hidin\u2019 out in the mountains,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cUp in a cave, like Sirius did when he \u2014\u201d\n\nHagrid broke off, cleared his throat gruffly, looked at Harry, and took a long draught of juice.\n\n\u201cAnyway, back now,\u201d he said feebly.\n\n\u201cYou \u2014 you look better,\u201d said Harry, who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from Sirius.\n\n\u201cWha\u2019?\u201d said Hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face. \u201cOh \u2014 oh yeah. Well, Grawpy\u2019s loads better behaved now, loads. Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back, ter tell yeh the truth. He\u2019s a good lad, really. . . . I\u2019ve bin thinkin\u2019 abou\u2019 tryin\u2019 ter find him a lady friend, actually . . .\u201d\n\nHarry would normally have tried to persuade Hagrid out of this idea at once. The prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the forest, possibly even wilder and more brutal than Grawp, was positively alarming, but somehow Harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point. He was starting to wish he was alone again, and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice, half emptying his glass.\n\n\u201cEv\u2019ryone knows you\u2019ve bin tellin\u2019 the truth now, Harry,\u201d said Hagrid softly and unexpectedly. \u201cTha\u2019s gotta be better, hasn\u2019 it?\u201d\n\nHarry shrugged.\n\n\u201cLook . . .\u201d Hagrid leaned toward him across the table, \u201cI knew Sirius longer \u2019n you did. . . . He died in battle, an\u2019 tha\u2019s the way he\u2019d\u2019ve wanted ter go \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go at all!\u201d said Harry angrily.\n\nHagrid bowed his great shaggy head.\n\n\u201cNah, I don\u2019 reckon he did,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut still, Harry . . . he was never one ter sit around at home an\u2019 let other people do the fightin\u2019. He couldn\u2019 have lived with himself if he hadn\u2019 gone ter help \u2014\u201d\n\nHarry leapt up again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing,\u201d he said mechanically.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Hagrid, looking rather upset. \u201cOh . . . all righ\u2019 then, Harry . . . Take care of yerself then, an\u2019 drop back in if yeh\u2019ve got a mo . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . right . . .\u201d\n\nHarry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open. He was out in the sunshine again before Hagrid had finished saying good-bye and walked away across the lawn. Once again, people called out to him as he passed. He closed his eyes for a few moments, wishing they would all vanish, that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds. . . .\n\nA few days ago, before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision Voldemort had planted in his mind, he would have given almost anything for the Wizarding world to know that he had been telling the truth, for them to believe that Voldemort was back and know that he was neither a liar nor mad. Now, however . . .\n\nHe walked a short way around the lake, sat down on its bank, sheltered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrubs, and stared out over the gleaming water, thinking. . . .\n\nPerhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore. An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world. He was \u2014 he had always been \u2014 a marked man. It was just that he had never really understood what that meant. . . .\n\nAnd yet sitting here on the edge of the lake, with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him, with the loss of Sirius so raw and fresh inside, he could not muster any great sense of fear. It was sunny and the grounds around him were full of laughing people, and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race, it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include, or end in, murder. . . .\n\nHe sat there for a long time, gazing out at the water, trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here, on the opposite bank, that Sirius had collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors. . . .\n\nThe sun had fallen before he realized that he was cold. He got up and returned to the castle, wiping his face on his sleeve as he went.\n\n\nRon and Hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term. Hermione showed signs of wanting to talk about Sirius, but Ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name. Harry was not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet; his wishes varied with his mood. He knew one thing, though: Unhappy as he felt at the moment, he would greatly miss Hogwarts in a few days\u2019 time when he was back at number four, Privet Drive. Even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer, he did not feel any better about it. Indeed, he had never dreaded his return more.\n\nProfessor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. It seemed that she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises, whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. Many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running away down the path, and the Heads of Houses tried only halfheartedly to restrain their pupils. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick.\n\nTheir last evening at school arrived; most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the end-of-term feast, but Harry had not even started.\n\n\u201cJust do it tomorrow!\u201d said Ron, who was waiting by the door of their dormitory. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m starving . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be long. . . . Look, you go ahead . . .\u201d\n\nBut when the dormitory door closed behind Ron, Harry made no effort to speed up his packing. The very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the end-of-term feast. He was worried that Dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech. He was sure to mention Voldemort\u2019s return; he had talked to them about it last year, after all. . . .\n\nHarry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and, as he did so, noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it. He could not think what it was doing there. He bent down, pulled it out from underneath his trainers, and examined it.\n\nHe realized what it was within seconds. Sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of twelve Grimmauld Place. Use it if you need me, all right?\n\nHarry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package. Out fell a small, square mirror. It looked old; it was certainly dirty. Harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him.\n\nHe turned the mirror over. There on the reverse side was a scribbled note from Sirius.\n\nThis is a two-way mirror. I\u2019ve got the other. If you need to speak to me, just say my name into it; you\u2019ll appear in my mirror and I\u2019ll be able to talk in yours. James and I used to use them when we were in separate detentions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Harry\u2019s heart began to race. He remembered seeing his dead parents in the Mirror of Erised four years ago. He was going to be able to talk to Sirius again, right now, he knew it \u2014\n\nHe looked around to make sure there was nobody else there; the dormitory was quite empty. He looked back at the mirror, raised it in front of his face with trembling hands, and said, loudly and clearly, \u201cSirius.\u201d\n\nHis breath misted the surface of the glass. He held the mirror even closer, excitement flooding through him, but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own.\n\nHe wiped the mirror clear again and said, so that every syllable rang clearly through the room, \u201cSirius Black!\u201d\n\nNothing happened. The frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still, definitely, his own. . . .\n\nSirius didn\u2019t have his mirror on him when he went through the archway, said a small voice in Harry\u2019s head. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not working. . . .\n\nHarry remained quite still for a moment, then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered. He had been convinced, for a whole, shining minute, that he was going to see Sirius, talk to him again. . . .\n\nDisappointment was burning in his throat. He got up and began throwing his things pell-mell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror \u2014\n\nBut then an idea struck him. . . . A better idea than a mirror . . . A much bigger, more important idea . . . How had he never thought of it before \u2014 why had he never asked?\n\nHe was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase, hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing. He hurtled across the empty common room, through the portrait hole and off along the corridor, ignoring the Fat Lady, who called after him, \u201cThe feast is about to start, you know, you\u2019re cutting it very fine!\u201d\n\nBut Harry had no intention of going to the feast . . .\n\nHow could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you didn\u2019t need one, yet now . . .\n\nHe ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead. They were all, clearly, in the Great Hall. Outside his Charms classroom he came to a halt, panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later, until after the end of the feast . . .\n\nBut just as he had given up hope he saw it \u2014 a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor.\n\n\u201cHey \u2014 hey Nick! NICK!\u201d\n\nThe ghost stuck its head back out of the wall, revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington.\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d he said, withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at Harry. \u201cI am not the only one who is late, then? Though,\u201d he sighed, \u201cin rather different senses, of course . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNick, can I ask you something?\u201d\n\nA most peculiar expression stole over Nearly Headless Nick\u2019s face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter, apparently to give himself thinking time. He desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely.\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 now, Harry?\u201d said Nick, looking discomforted. \u201cCan\u2019t it wait until after the feast?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 Nick \u2014 please,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI really need to talk to you. Can we go in here?\u201d\n\nHarry opened the door of the nearest classroom and Nearly Headless Nick sighed.\n\n\u201cOh very well,\u201d he said, looking resigned. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend I haven\u2019t been expecting it.\u201d\n\nHarry was holding the door open for him, but he drifted through the wall instead.\n\n\u201cExpecting what?\u201d Harry asked, as he closed the door.\n\n\u201cYou to come and find me,\u201d said Nick, now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds. \u201cIt happens, sometimes . . . when somebody has suffered a . . . loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Harry, refusing to be deflected. \u201cYou were right, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve come to find you.\u201d\n\nNick said nothing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2014\u201d said Harry, who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated, \u201cit\u2019s just \u2014 you\u2019re dead. But you\u2019re still here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nNick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry urged him. \u201cYou died, but I\u2019m talking to you. . . . You can walk around Hogwarts and everything, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick quietly, \u201cI walk and talk, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you came back, didn\u2019t you?\u201d said Harry urgently. \u201cPeople can come back, right? As ghosts. They don\u2019t have to disappear completely. Well?\u201d he added impatiently, when Nick continued to say nothing.\n\nNearly Headless Nick hesitated, then said, \u201cNot everyone can come back as a ghost.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d said Harry quickly.\n\n\u201cOnly . . . only wizards.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry, and he almost laughed with relief. \u201cWell, that\u2019s okay then, the person I\u2019m asking about is a wizard. So he can come back, right?\u201d\n\nNick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at Harry. \u201cHe won\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cSirius Black,\u201d said Nick.\n\n\u201cBut you did!\u201d said Harry angrily. \u201cYou came back \u2014 you\u2019re dead and you didn\u2019t disappear \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod,\u201d said Nick miserably. \u201cBut very few wizards choose that path.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Harry. \u201cAnyway \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 Sirius won\u2019t care if it\u2019s unusual, he\u2019ll come back, I know he will!\u201d\n\nAnd so strong was his belief that Harry actually turned his head to check the door, sure, for a split second, that he was going to see Sirius, pearly white and transparent but beaming, walking through it toward him.\n\n\u201cHe will not come back,\u201d repeated Nick quietly. \u201cHe will have . . . gone on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, \u2018gone on\u2019?\u201d said Harry quickly. \u201cGone on where? Listen \u2014 what happens when you die, anyway? Where do you go? Why doesn\u2019t everyone come back? Why isn\u2019t this place full of ghosts? Why \u2014 ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot answer,\u201d said Nick.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dead, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Harry exasperatedly. \u201cWho can answer better than you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was afraid of death,\u201d said Nick. \u201cI chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn\u2019t to have . . . Well, that is neither here nor there. . . . In fact, I am neither here nor there . . .\u201d He gave a small sad chuckle. \u201cI know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead. I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about that place!\u201d said Harry fiercely.\n\n\u201cI am sorry not to have been more help,\u201d said Nick gently. \u201cWell . . . well, do excuse me . . . the feast, you know . . .\u201d\n\nAnd he left the room, leaving Harry there alone, gazing blankly at the wall through which Nick had disappeared.\n\nHarry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more. He walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle, wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again.\n\nHe had turned the corner toward the Fat Lady\u2019s corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall. A second glance showed him that it was Luna. There were no good hiding places nearby, she was bound to have heard his footsteps, and in any case, Harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d said Luna vaguely, glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice.\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re not at the feast?\u201d Harry asked.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve lost most of my possessions,\u201d said Luna serenely. \u201cPeople take them and hide them, you know. But as it\u2019s the last night, I really do need them back, so I\u2019ve been putting up signs.\u201d\n\nShe gestured toward the notice board, upon which, sure enough, she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes, with a plea for their return.\n\nAn odd feeling rose in Harry \u2014 an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius\u2019s death. It was a few moments before he realized that he was feeling sorry for Luna.\n\n\u201cHow come people hide your stuff?\u201d he asked her, frowning.\n\n\u201cOh . . . well . . .\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI think they think I\u2019m a bit odd, you know. Some people call me \u2018Loony\u2019 Lovegood, actually.\u201d\n\nHarry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no reason for them to take your things,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cD\u2019you want help finding them?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d she said, smiling at him. \u201cThey\u2019ll come back, they always do in the end. It was just that I wanted to pack tonight. Anyway . . . why aren\u2019t you at the feast?\u201d\n\nHarry shrugged. \u201cJust didn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Luna, observing him with those oddly misty, protuberant eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you do. That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasn\u2019t he? Ginny told me.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius. He had just remembered that she too could see thestrals.\n\n\u201cHave you . . .\u201d he began. \u201cI mean, who . . . has anyone you\u2019ve known ever died?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Luna simply, \u201cmy mother. She was a quite extraordinary witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\n\u201cYes, it was rather horrible,\u201d said Luna conversationally. \u201cI still feel very sad about it sometimes. But I\u2019ve still got Dad. And anyway, it\u2019s not as though I\u2019ll never see Mum again, is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr \u2014 isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Harry uncertainly.\n\nShe shook her head in disbelief. \u201cOh, come on. You heard them, just behind the veil, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of sight, that\u2019s all. You heard them.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other. Luna was smiling slightly. Harry did not know what to say, or to think. Luna believed so many extraordinary things . . . yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil too. . . .\n\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to help you look for your stuff?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Luna. \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up. . . . It always does in the end. . . . Well, have a nice holiday, Harry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah . . . yeah, you too.\u201d\n\nShe walked away from him, and as he watched her go, he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly.\n\n\nThe journey home on the Hogwarts Express next day was eventful in several ways. Firstly, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses, attempted to ambush Harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet. The attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of D.A. members, who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to Harry\u2019s aid. By the time Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Anthony Goldstein, and Terry Boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes Harry had taught them, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into Hogwarts uniforms as Harry, Ernie, and Justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze.\n\n\u201cI must say, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing Malfoy\u2019s mother\u2019s face when he gets off the train,\u201d said Ernie with some satisfaction, as he watched Malfoy squirm above him. Ernie had never quite got over the indignity of Malfoy docking points from Hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the Inquisitorial Squad.\n\n\u201cGoyle\u2019s mum\u2019ll be really pleased, though,\u201d said Ron, who had come to investigate the source of the commotion. \u201cHe\u2019s loads better-looking now. . . . Anyway, Harry, the food trolley\u2019s just stopped if you want anything . . .\u201d\n\nHarry thanked the others and accompanied Ron back to their compartment, where he bought a large pile of Cauldron Cakes and Pumpkin Pasties. Hermione was reading the Daily Prophet again, Ginny was doing a quiz in The Quibbler, and Neville was stroking his Mimbulus mimbletonia, which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched.\n\nHarry and Ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while Hermione read out snippets from the Prophet. It was now full of articles about how to repel dementors, attempts by the Ministry to track down Death Eaters, and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen Lord Voldemort walking past their house that very morning. . . .\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t really started yet,\u201d sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be long now . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, Harry,\u201d said Ron, nodding toward the glass window onto the corridor.\n\nHarry looked around. Cho was passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava. His and Cho\u2019s eyes met for a moment. Cho blushed and kept walking. Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron\u2019s knight.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2014 er \u2014 going on with you and her anyway?\u201d Ron asked quietly.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry truthfully.\n\n\u201cI \u2014 er \u2014 heard she\u2019s going out with someone else now,\u201d said Hermione tentatively.\n\nHarry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all. Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him. So much of what he had wanted before Sirius\u2019s death felt that way these days. . . . The week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer: It stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re well out of it, mate,\u201d said Ron forcefully. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably cheerful enough with someone else,\u201d said Harry, shrugging.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s she with now anyway?\u201d Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.\n\n\u201cMichael Corner,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMichael \u2014 but \u2014\u201d said Ron, craning around in his seat to stare at her. \u201cBut you were going out with him!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d said Ginny resolutely. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky, so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead.\u201d She scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill, turned The Quibbler upside down, and began marking her answers. Ron looked highly delighted.\n\n\u201cWell, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,\u201d he said, prodding his queen forward toward Harry\u2019s quivering castle. \u201cGood for you. Just choose someone \u2014 better \u2014 next time.\u201d\n\nHe cast Harry an oddly furtive look as he said it.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve chosen Dean Thomas, would you say he\u2019s better?\u201d asked Ginny vaguely.\n\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d shouted Ron, upending the chessboard. Crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and Hedwig and Pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead.\n\nAs the train slowed down in the approach to King\u2019s Cross, Harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less. He even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off, but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of September, when it would take him back to Hogwarts. When it finally puffed to a standstill, however, he lifted down Hedwig\u2019s cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual.\n\nWhen the ticket inspector signaled to him, Ron, and Hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten, however, he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side: a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not expected at all.\n\nThere was Mad-Eye Moody, looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it, his gnarled hands clutching a long staff, his body wrapped in a voluminous traveling cloak. Tonks stood just behind him, her bright bubble-gum-pink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass station ceiling, wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple T-shirt bearing the legend THE WEIRD SISTERS. Next to Tonks was Lupin, his face pale, his hair graying, a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers. At the front of the group stood Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, dressed in their Muggle best, and Fred and George, who were both wearing brand-new jackets in some lurid green, scaly material.\n\n\u201cRon, Ginny!\u201d called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying forward and hugging her children tightly. \u201cOh, and Harry dear \u2014 how are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d lied Harry, as she pulled him into a tight embrace. Over her shoulder he saw Ron goggling at the twins\u2019 new clothes.\n\n\u201cWhat are they supposed to be?\u201d he asked, pointing at the jackets.\n\n\u201cFinest dragon skin, little bro,\u201d said Fred, giving his zip a little tweak. \u201cBusiness is booming and we thought we\u2019d treat ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, Harry,\u201d said Lupin, as Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry and turned to greet Hermione.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect . . . what are you all doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Lupin with a slight smile, \u201cwe thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno if that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said Harry at once.\n\n\u201cOh, I think it is,\u201d growled Moody, who had limped a little closer. \u201cThat\u2019ll be them, will it, Potter?\u201d\n\nHe pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat. Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see Harry\u2019s reception committee.\n\n\u201cAh, Harry!\u201d said Mr. Weasley, turning from Hermione\u2019s parents, whom he had been greeting enthusiastically, and who were taking it in turns to hug Hermione. \u201cWell \u2014 shall we do it, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I reckon so, Arthur,\u201d said Moody.\n\nHe and Mr. Weasley took the lead across the station toward the place where the Dursleys stood, apparently rooted to the floor. Hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group.\n\n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said Mr. Weasley pleasantly to Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt right in front of him. \u201cYou might remember me, my name\u2019s Arthur Weasley.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Dursleys\u2019 living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. Sure enough, Uncle Vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at Mr. Weasley, but chose not to say anything, partly, perhaps, because the Dursleys were outnumbered two to one. Aunt Petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed. She kept glancing around, as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company. Dudley, meanwhile, seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant, a feat at which he was failing extravagantly.\n\n\u201cWe thought we\u2019d just have a few words with you about Harry,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, still smiling.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d growled Moody. \u201cAbout how he\u2019s treated when he\u2019s at your place.\u201d\n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s mustache seemed to bristle with indignation. Possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit, he addressed himself to Moody.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect what you\u2019re not aware of would fill several books, Dursley,\u201d growled Moody.\n\n\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s not the point,\u201d interjected Tonks, whose pink hair seemed to offend Aunt Petunia more than all the rest put together, for she closed her eyes rather than look at her. \u201cThe point is, if we find out you\u2019ve been horrible to Harry \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014 and make no mistake, we\u2019ll hear about it,\u201d added Lupin pleasantly.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, \u201ceven if you won\u2019t let Harry use the fellytone \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTelephone,\u201d whispered Hermione.\n\n\u201cYeah, if we get any hint that Potter\u2019s been mistreated in any way, you\u2019ll have us to answer to,\u201d said Moody.\n\nUncle Vernon swelled ominously. His sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs.\n\n\u201cAre you threatening me, sir?\u201d he said, so loudly that passersby actually turned to stare.\n\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d said Mad-Eye, who seemed rather pleased that Uncle Vernon had grasped this fact so quickly.\n\n\u201cAnd do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated?\u201d barked Uncle Vernon.\n\n\u201cWell . . .\u201d said Moody, pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye. Uncle Vernon leapt backward in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley. \u201cYes, I\u2019d have to say you do, Dursley.\u201d\n\nHe turned from Uncle Vernon to Harry. \u201cSo, Potter . . . give us a shout if you need us. If we don\u2019t hear from you for three days in a row, we\u2019ll send someone along . . .\u201d\n\nAunt Petunia whimpered piteously. It could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbors would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path.\n\n\u201c\u2019Bye, then, Potter,\u201d said Moody, grasping Harry\u2019s shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand.\n\n\u201cTake care, Harry,\u201d said Lupin quietly. \u201cKeep in touch.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry, we\u2019ll have you away from there as soon as we can,\u201d Mrs. Weasley whispered, hugging him again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you soon, mate,\u201d said Ron anxiously, shaking Harry\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cReally soon, Harry,\u201d said Hermione earnestly. \u201cWe promise.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded. He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side. Instead he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around, and led the way out of the station toward the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley hurrying along in his wake."}
